What sets them apart are their vicious claws of stone-sharpened bone, protruding through worn down, fleshless fingers as a result of desperate and futile attempts to escape.</p>\n<p>Walcofindes are bound to their death site. These \"wall-coffined\" undead can manifest their forms within the structure where they were sealed, possessing the walls and stealthily traversing along them. Walcofindes' manifestations adopt the patterned appearance of the structure's materials, but not its physical properties. They take the form of hungry, grasping humanoid torsos emerging from the walls like harrowing extensions of their eternal prison. Unable to ever fully leave their structures, these undead are destined to be a part of it forever.</p>\n<p>Despite their decaying forms, walcofindes retain the intelligence they would've had in life; for example, a walcofinde who was previously a soldier could understand enemy tactics and assess the appearance and equipment of their foes, allowing them to strategize and prioritize targets as well as organize with other nearby walcofindes to formulate an attack.</p>",
