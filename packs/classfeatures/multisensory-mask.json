While wearing the armor, you gain concealment against all creatures, even if they are using a nonvisual precise sense, such as a bat's echolocation. As normal for effects that leave your location obvious, you can't use this concealment to Hide or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sneak]. If you use a hostile action, the concealment ends until you restore the mask as a single action, which has the manipulate trait.</p>"
