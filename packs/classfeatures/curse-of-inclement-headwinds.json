You gain electricity weakness 2 and electricity spells or effects that have additional effects for a creature wearing or holding metal treat you as though you were wearing metal. Any immunity or resistance you have to such spells and effects is suppressed.</p>\n<p><strong>Cursebound 2</strong> Blowing winds impose a -2 circumstance penalty to ranged attack rolls you make.</p>\n<p><strong>Cursebound 3</strong> Your weakness to electricity is equal to 5 + your level.</p>\n<p><strong>Cursebound 4</strong> The raging winds push you back, imposing a -10-foot status penalty to all your Speeds.</p>"
