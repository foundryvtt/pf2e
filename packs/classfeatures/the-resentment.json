Your patron is likely far from the upper echelons of its kind, such as a hag ousted from its coven or a quasi-divinity or a lower-rank demon. This leaves it only subtler and weaker tools to see its ends met: curses, hexes, and you.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell List</strong> occult</p>\n<p><strong>Patron Skill</strong> Occultism</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson of Strength's Impermanence</strong> Your patron has taught you that power can be taken much more easily that it can be built. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Evil Eye] hex cantrip and your familiar learns @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Enfeeble].</p>\n<p><strong>Familiar of Ongoing Misery</strong> Your familiar seems hostile to all creatures other than you, hissing at them if they get too near. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, your familiar can curse a creature within 15 feet of it, prolonging the duration of any negative conditions affecting it by 1 round. This is a curse effect. This prolongs only conditions with a timed duration (such as \"1 round\" or \"until the end of your next turn\") and doesn't prevent conditions from being removed by other means.</p>"
