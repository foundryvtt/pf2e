You come to bear an epithetâ€”a word or phrase that seems to always stick in the mind of those describing you. (You can find examples of acquiring epithets in the Earning your Name sidebar on page 35.) Your epithets grant you additional abilities, especially when your divine spark is brought to the surface.</p>\n<p>You first gain a root epithet to describe an aspect of your personality. This grants you a skill, as well as a special effect that occurs when you Spark Transcendence. If you are already trained in the granted skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice, as normal. An effect that occurs after you Spark Transcendence happens immediately after your transcendence action is completely resolved.</p>"
