Magic flowing from one hand stitches wounds, and vigor ebbs from the other. After you Spark Transcendence, choose any number of willing or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious] creatures in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]. Each of these creatures that's dying loses the dying condition and remains unconscious at 0 Hit Points, and each one that isn't dying gains 10 temporary Hit Points that last until the start of your next turn. This is a healing vitality effect.</p>"
