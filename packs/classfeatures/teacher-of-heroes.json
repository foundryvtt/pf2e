The first piece of knowledge you gain when Recalling Knowledge in this way is always the enemy's immunities. If the enemy has no immunities, you learn its greatest resistance; if it also possesses no resistances, you learn its greatest weakness; if it possesses none of the above, you learn its lowest saving throw.</p>"
