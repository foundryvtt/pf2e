You don't gain Shield Block as a class feature. You are trained in both Acrobatics and Athletics, rather than one or the other.</p>\n<p>Choose one physical damage type, which becomes your cursed weakness: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. You gain weakness to this damage type equal to half your level (minimum 1).</p>\n<p>You gain Diehard as a bonus feat, but you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed]{Doomed 2} whenever you take damage from your cursed weakness (unless your doomed value is already higher).</p>\n<p>Your fighter weapon mastery and weapon legend class features grant you increased proficiency in both spears and polearms, but you can't choose any other weapon group with these class features.</p>"
