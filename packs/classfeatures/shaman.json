You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spirit Familiar (Animist)]{Spirit Familiar} feat. At 2nd level, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Enhanced Familiar] feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Invocation of Growth (9th):</strong> Your bond with the physical form of your chosen apparition grows stronger. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Incredible Familiar] feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Invocation of Otherworldliness (17th):</strong> Your apparition familiar becomes ever more powerful, straddling the line between physical and spiritual. Your spirit familiar can take a single action that has the concentrate trait to become incorporeal for 1 minute. It gains the incorporeal trait, meaning it can move through physical creatures and such creatures can move through it. It can't attempt Strength-based checks (such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Grapple]) against corporeal creatures, and corporeal creatures can't attempt such checks against it. It gains immunity to precision damage and resistance to physical damage (except damage from Strikes with the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Ghost Touch] property rune) equal to half your level (double against non-magical damage) but weakness to force damage equal to half your level. However, when incorporeal, your spirit familiar can travel no more than 60 feet from you and must maintain line of effect to you; this typically prevents it from moving through walls. Your spirit familiar can Dismiss this effect.</p>"
