They first appeared to you in the faces of your neighbors in the middle of a town festival or council meeting, when the success of an endeavor hinged on everyone working together. With the strength of your patron behind you, you then rallied the community together for a common goal. Your patron might be a single entity gathering a coterie of subjects together for an unknown cause or a like-minded covenant of deities and spirits. Whatever the case, your patron—and by extension, you—understands that mortals are stronger together.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell List</strong> divine</p>\n<p><strong>Patron Skill</strong> Religion</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson of Community Knowledge</strong> Your patron taught you the importance of pooling information to help a group with a common cause. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Share Vision] hex cantrip and your familiar learns @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Share Lore].</p>\n<p><strong>Familiar of Bolstering Aid</strong> Your familiar knows all manner of tricks that can help!
