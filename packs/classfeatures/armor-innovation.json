            "value": "<p>Your innovation is a cutting-edge suit of medium armor with a variety of attached gizmos and devices. Choose one of the sets of statistics on Innovation Armor Statistics table for your innovation armor (or choose another set of innovation armor statistics to which you have access). Your innovation armor can have fundamental and property runes added to it in the same way as ordinary armor. Because of the unique features of your innovation, everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be trained (or better) in medium armor. Choose one initial armor modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial armor modifications to which you have access.</p><ul><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.dsy2w4LfjMIWgy5D]{Harmonic Oscillator}:</strong> You designed your armor to inaudibly thrum at just the right frequency to create interference against force and sound waves. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to force and sonic damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Metallic Reactance]:</strong> The metals in your armor are carefully alloyed to ground electricity and protect from acidic chemical reactions. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to acid and electricity damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Muscular Exoskeleton] (Power Suit only):</strong> Your armor supports your muscles with a carefully crafted exoskeleton. When you send your armor into overdrive, the exoskeleton supplements your feats of athletics as well. When under the effects of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks; if you're a master in Crafting, this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Otherworldly Protection]:</strong> Just because you prefer science doesn't mean you can't build your armor with materials and gizmos designed to protect against otherworldly attacks. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to void damage, or to vitality damage if you have void healing (such as if you're a dhampir). You gain the same amount of resistance to spirit damage. If you are sanctified (such as by also being a champion or cleric dedicated to a deity who allows or enforces sanctification) this resistance applies to unholy damage (if you are sanctified holy) or holy damage (if you are sanctified unholy), regardless of what other traits the damage has.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Phlogistonic Regulator]:</strong> A layer of insulation within your armor protects you from rapid temperature fluctuations. You gain resistance equal to half your level to cold and fire damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li><li><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Speed Boosters]:</strong> You have boosters in your armor that increase your Speed. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed, which increases to a +10-foot status bonus when under the effects of Overdrive.</p></li><li><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Subtle Dampeners]</strong> <strong>(Subterfuge Suit only)</strong>: You've designed your armor to help you blend in and dampen noise slightly. When you send your armor into overdrive, the dampeners increase their effect, improving your Stealth. When under the effects of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks. If you're a master in Crafting, this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.</p></li></ul>"
