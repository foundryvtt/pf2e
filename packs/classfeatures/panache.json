When you perform an action with particular style, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This heightened state of flair is called panache.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Item.Effect: Panache]</p>\n<p>You gain panache by performing actions that have the bravado trait. @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Tumble Through] and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler's style gain the bravado trait when you use them. The GM might determine that a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, can gain the bravado trait. These checks typically involve at least a single action and a non-trivial DC. Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.</p>\n<p>Powerful finisher actions, including @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Confident Finisher], can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache.</p>"
