Each instinct grants an instinct ability, plus more abilities you can gain via feats that list that instinct as a prerequisite. It also determines what damage you resist with raging resistance and, at higher levels, increases the additional damage you deal when you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Rage].</p>\n<p>Each instinct lists acts that are anathema to it.
