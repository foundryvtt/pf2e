Add two common 10th-rank occult spells to your repertoire; you gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using psychic spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Mind Over Matter] psychic feat to gain a second slot.</p>"
