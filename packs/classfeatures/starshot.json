Each creature in the area must succeed at a @Check[reflex|against:class|basic] save against your class DC or take spirit damage equal to your normal Strike damage with the starshot. Creatures larger than you take a –2 circumstance penalty to their saving throws. This shot requires any ammunition that would normally be required for the weapon.</p>"
