You can exchange as many spell slots as you have available. Bonus spell slots must be of a spell rank you can normally cast, and each bonus spell slot must be of a different spell rank. You can also trade any spell slot for two additional cantrips, though you can't trade more than one spell slot at a time for additional cantrips in this way.</p>"
