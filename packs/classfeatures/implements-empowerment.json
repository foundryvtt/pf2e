When you Strike, you can trace mystic patterns with an implement you're holding to empower the Strike, causing it to deal 2 additional Damage per weapon damage die. Channeling the power requires full use of your hands. You don't gain the benefit of implement's empowerment if you are holding anything in either hand other than a single one-handed weapon, other implements, or esoterica, and you must be holding at least one implement to gain the benefit.</p>"
