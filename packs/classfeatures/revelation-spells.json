            "value": "<p>The powers of your mystery manifest in the form of revelation spells. Revelation spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to search for omens in a way befitting your mystery, like gazing into a fire, throwing bones and seeing how they fall, or meditating to hear the voices of those who came before you.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells.</p>\n<p>The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points.</p>\n<p>You learn a revelation spell at 1st level and start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. This spell is an initial revelation spell determined by your mystery. You can learn additional revelation spells through oracle feats.</p>"
