These apparitions are drawn to animists who harbor violent thoughts or impulses but are more likely to linger with animists who can quell their hatred. Stalkers in darkened boughs are moody, impulsive, and prone to seeing things from the least charitable perspective.</p>\n<p><strong>Apparition Skills</strong> Forest Lore, Hunting Lore</p>\n<p><strong>Apparition Spells</strong> Cantrip gouging claw; 1st runic body; 2nd vomit swarm PC2 ; 3rd wall of thorns; 4th bestial curse PC2 ; 5th moon frenzy; 6th tangling creepers; 7th unfettered pack; 8th monstrosity form; 9th wrathful storm</p>\n<p><strong>Vessel Spell</strong> darkened forest form</p>\n<p><strong>Avatar</strong> Beast of the Boughs Speed 70 feet, fly Speed 70 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Melee</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> devouring jaws (deadly 3d10, reach 15 feet),</p>\n<p><strong>Damage</strong> 6d10+6 piercing</p>"
