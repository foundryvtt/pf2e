You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wilding Word] hex cantrip and your familiar learns your choice of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Summon Animal] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Summon Plant or Fungus].</p>\n<p><strong>Familiar of Keen Senses</strong> Your familiar has glinting eyes, twitching ears, or some other sign of a beast's powerful senses. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, your familiar gains your choice of an imprecise scent, tremorsense, or wavesense, with a range of 60 feet until the start of your next turn, and it can immediately Point Out as a free action.</p>"
