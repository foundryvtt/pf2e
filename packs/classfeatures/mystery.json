This power could come from a potent concept or ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous conduit to raw divine power. This is the oracle's mystery, a source of divine magic not beholden to any deity.</p>\n<p>Choose the mystery that empowers your magic. Your mystery grants you additional spells, and special focus spells called revelation spells. Your mystery also gives you a unique cursebound ability that lets you draw upon the divine, as well as dictating the effects of the oracular curse that falls upon you when you touch too much of this power.</p><hr /><ul><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Ancestors] Voices of past generations teach and haunt you.</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Battle] You embody the virtues upheld by heroes of legend.</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bones] Death always seems near, and the dead speak to you.</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Cosmos] You draw power from the stars and the spaces between.</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Flames] You dance with fire and do your best to remain unscorched by it.</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Life] The teeming energies of life flow through you out into the world.</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Lore] You gain access to unparalleled, overwhelming knowledge.</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Tempest] Wind, waves, and storms rage at your beck and call.</li></ul><h3>Reading a Mystery Entry</h3><p>A mystery entry contains the following information, followed by a description of that mystery's curse.</p>\n<p><strong>Granted Spells</strong> You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, as described in Spell Repertoire on page 130. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a 1st-rank spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast oracle spells of that rank.</p>\n<p><strong>Revelation Spells</strong> You automatically gain your mystery's initial revelation spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the Advanced Revelation, Greater Revelation, and Diverse Mystery oracle feats. These spells start on page 259.</p>\n<p><strong>Related Domains</strong> These are the cleric domains associated with your mystery. You gain domain spells, which you can cast as revelation spells, by taking the Domain Acumen and Domain Fluency feats. At 11th level, the divine access class feature also gives you additional slotted spells based on your domains. The domains and their domain spells appear on page 372 of Player Core. Domains marked with an asterisk (*) are found in Pathfinder Lost Omens Divine Mysteries.</p>\n<p><strong>Mystery Skill</strong> You become trained in the listed skill. A few mysteries make you trained in more than one skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Oracle Feat</strong> You gain this 1st-level oracle feat. This is a cursebound feat, so using it aggravates your oracular curse.</p>"
