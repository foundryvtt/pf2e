If you have warden spells, your proficiency rank for spell attacks and spell DCs increases to master. When using a ranged weapon that you have master proficiency in, you can ignore the penalty if attacking your hunted prey within the weapon's second and third range increments.</p>\n<p>If you have master proficiency in Perception, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Perception checks when you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] your prey, and if you have master proficiency in Survival, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Survival checks when you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Track] your prey. You also gain an additional benefit depending on your hunter's edge.</p>\n<p><strong>Flurry:</strong> You can blend your weapon mastery with skillful targeting to make a series of precise attacks. If you have master proficiency with your weapon, your multiple attack penalty for attacks against your hunted prey is –2 (–1 with an agile weapon) on your second attack of the turn, and –4 (–2 with an agile weapon) on your third and subsequent attacks of the turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Outwit:</strong> Your mastery of skills allows you to overwhelm your prey. If you have master proficiency in Deception, Intimidation, Stealth, or the skill you use to Recall Knowledge about your prey, increase the circumstance bonus against the prey with that skill from +2 to +4. If you have master proficiency with your armor, increase the circumstance bonus to AC against the prey from +1 to +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Precision:</strong> Your weapon mastery allows you to hit your prey's vital areas multiple times. The second time in a round you hit your hunted prey, you also deal 1d8 precision damage. At 19th level, your second hit in a round against your hunted prey deals 2d8 precision damage, and your third hit in a round against your hunted prey deals 1d8 precision damage.</p>"
