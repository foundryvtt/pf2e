            "value": "<h3><strong>Gate Junctions</strong></h3>\n<p>When you gain a gate junction, you develop a specialized kinetic technique. Choose one benefit from the gate junction table for one of your kinetic elements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>critical blast</strong> junction happens when you get a critical success with an Elemental Blast of the kinetic element.</li>\n<li>An <strong>elemental resistance</strong> grants you resistance to damage while your kinetic aura is active. This resistance is equal to your level, and it applies to damage of any listed type or that comes from a creature or effect that has any of the listed traits. At 17th level, you gain immunity to effects with any of the listed traits. This doesn't make you immune to creatures with such a trait. You can voluntarily forgo this resistance, immunity, or both if you want an effect to work on you.</li>\n<li>You can choose an <strong>impulse junction</strong> instead of one of the listed junctions. Impulse junctions are listed under Single Gate.</li>\n<li>An <strong>aura junction</strong> adds an effect to your kinetic aura when you Channel Elements.</li>\n<li>A <strong>skill junction</strong> makes you trained in the listed skill and grants you the listed skill feat. If you were already trained in the listed skill, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. While your kinetic aura is active, you gain a +1 status bonus to the listed skill; the bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 17th level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can select each gate junction only once, unless noted otherwise, but you can have the same type of junction for multiple elements. You can always choose not to use a gate junction when it would normally occur. If you have multiple junctions that would apply at the same time - such as kinetic aura junctions for different elements - you can apply any number of them. (Though note that you can use only one impulse junction per round.)</p>"
