Your proficiency rank for your investigator class DC increases to master.</p>\n<p>In addition, if you enter a new location that includes another clue toward answering the question at the heart of one of your active investigations, the GM informs you of the existence of the clue and its type: an object, person, spell effect, or the like. When you find the clue, the GM informs you that you've done so.</p>\n<p>If there is more than one clue in the location, the GM chooses one to inform you about. When you find any of the clues in that location, the GM informs you that you've done so, even if it wasn't the clue they'd chosen or there are other clues you haven't found.</p>"
