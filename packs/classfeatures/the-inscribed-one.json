You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Discern Secrets] hex and your familiar learns @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Runic Weapon].</p>\n<p><strong>Familiar of Flowing Script</strong> Your familiar is covered in a pattern that looks similar to letters in an unknown language, one that seems to draw attention even as it eludes understanding. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, the letters begin to rapidly change, causing a distraction. Until the start of your next turn, your familiar can provide flanking for you and your allies as though it were able to attack and had a reach of 5 feet; this is a visual effect.</p>"
