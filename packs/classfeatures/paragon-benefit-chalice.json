(This reduces the stunned condition only if it has a condition value, not when it has a duration.) The drinker also reduces its @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained] value by 1, but it can reduce its drained condition by Drinking from the Chalice only once per day.</p>\n<p>In addition, the chalice attempts to counteract all poisons, diseases, and curses afflicting the drinker, using half your level rounded up as the counteract rank and your class DC - 10 as the counteract modifier. If the chalice fails to counteract a given affliction for a drinker, it can't attempt to counteract that affliction again until midnight.</p>"
