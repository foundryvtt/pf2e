            "value": "<p>You see all things in the world as fleeting and temporary, waiting to be purified into their base essence: the ash left behind after a burning fire. While you understand fire as a necessary part of this process, you see it mostly as a tool to achieve final purity, not the true goal. You have much in common with oracles with the flames mystery, but you may consider them to be shortsighted, or at best, simply lacking in understanding of the truths that their burning fires impart.</p>\n<p>You might see ash as the only true representation of the impermanent nature of life and its pointless existence. Alternatively, you may see the benefit ash can have on soils and farmlands as part of a larger cycle of death and rebirth. Perhaps you see the phoenix, with its life cycle of being reduced to ash and reborn, as a sacred creature that has achieved a higher state of being and is worthy of imitation, or perhaps you see it as a tragic creature that can never reach the goal of perfection. If you follow a deity, you might follow gods of fire like Sarenrae, those who burn impurities to ash such as Brigh or Torag, or those who strive to burn all things to ash, such as the archdevil Moloch or the demon lord Flauros.</p>\n<p><strong>Granted Spells</strong> cantrip: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ignition], 1st: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Breathe Fire]; 2nd: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mist] (takes the form of ash); 6th: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Disintegrate]</p>\n<p><strong>Revelation Spells</strong> initial: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ashen Wind]; advanced: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Incendiary Ashes]; greater: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ash Form]</p>\n<p><strong>Related Domains</strong> destruction, dust, fire, nothingness</p>\n<p><strong>Mystery Skill</strong> Occultism</p>\n<p><strong>Oracle Feat</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Whispers of Weakness]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Curse of Creeping Ashes]</p>"
