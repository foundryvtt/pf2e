If your deity's favored weapon is a simple weapon or an unarmed attack, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Deadly Simplicity] cleric feat.

When you critically succeed at an attack roll using your deity's favored weapon, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect; you can use your spell DC in place of your class DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Fourth Doctrine (11th):</strong> Your proficiency ranks for the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics increase to expert.</p>\n<p><strong>Fifth Doctrine (15th):</strong> Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master.
