For many bards, a teacher or rival fills this role, although some set their sights higher and attempt to surpass great composers of the past or blaze a new trail entirely.

Art inspired by a maestro muse is precise and inventive, a formalist achievement.</p>\n<p>As a bard with a maestro muse, you are an inspiration to your allies and confident of your musical and oratorical abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Muse Feat</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Lingering Composition]</p>\n<p><strong>Muse Spell</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Soothe]</em></p>"
