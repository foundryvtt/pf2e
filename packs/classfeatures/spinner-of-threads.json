Was your patron a norn? A herald of a deity like Pharasma, Alseta, or Grandmother Spider? Could it even be a single individual appearing at three or more points in its timeline—multiple versions of the same being, parallel threads converging on a single moment?</p>\n<p><strong>Spell List</strong> occult</p>\n<p><strong>Patron Skill</strong> Occultism</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson of Fate's Vicissitudes</strong> Your patron's harsh lesson is that fate spares no one, rising and falling in turn for all. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Nudge Fate] hex cantrip and your familiar learns @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Sure Strike].</p>\n<p><strong>Familiar of Balanced Luck</strong> Your familiar has a spot on its body that looks like a good luck charm or a bad omen, depending on the angle. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, one creature within 15 feet of your familiar gets your choice of either a +1 status bonus to its AC or a –1 status penalty to its AC until the start of your next turn.</p>"
