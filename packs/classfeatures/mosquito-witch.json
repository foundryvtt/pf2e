            "value": "<p>Your patron is a mysterious being known as the Mosquito Witch. You do not know why you were chosen, and in many cases, you wish that you hadn't been. She may have made herself known to you through terrifying prophetic visions and nightmares, or you might have instead received her patronage in the form of swarming insects, their buzzing opening your ears to magic and their bites filling your body with power. Frightening events plague your wake: strange accidents, dead animals, and glowing red eyes in the darkness. Whether or not you're aware of the Mosquito Witch's influence, you have an affinity with insects, and typically draw their attention wherever you go.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell List</strong> primal</p>\n<p><strong>Patron Skill</strong> Nature</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson of the Unbridled Hive</strong> The Mosquito Witch grants you control over insects. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Buzzing Bites] hex cantrip and your familiar learns @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Pest Form].</p>\n<p><strong>Familiar of Swarm's Heart</strong> Your familiar is surrounded by a cloud of harmless insects. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, the insects swarm to protect you and your allies. Until the start of your next turn, your familiar grants concealment to you or any ally while sharing the same space.<em>.</em></p>"
