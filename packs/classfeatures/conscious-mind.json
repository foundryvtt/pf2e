            "value": "<p>Whatever the subconscious source of a psychic's power, all find that a specific external manifestation of their magic comes most easily to them. This conscious outward expression adds several additional spells to your spell repertoire and grants you three psi cantrips. Two of these cantrips are common spells, though you gain an extra benefit with them that other spellcasters don't get, and the last is unique to your conscious mind. You also get two more unique psi cantrips at higher levels. Choose a conscious mind from the following options .</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.The Distant Grasp]:</strong> Manipulate physical objects with telekinesis.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.The Infinite Eye]:</strong> Observe the world and weaponize your knowledge.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.The Oscillating Wave]:</strong> Redistribute thermal energy to create blazing heat and bone-chilling cold.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.The Silent Whisper]:</strong> Tap into the thoughts of those around you to soothe or influence.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.The Tangible Dream]:</strong> Weave your imagination into creations of force and light.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.The Unbound Step]:</strong> Bend and traverse space with teleportation and phasing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Specific spells you learn come from your conscious mind, which shapes the raw psychic power from your subconscious into the forms and phenomena that you intentionally cast. You select your conscious mind at 1st level, and it detemines the following.</p>\n<p><strong>Granted Spells </strong> You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, in addition to those you gain through psychic spellcasting. At 1st level, you gain a 1st-rank spell, and you learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast psychic spells of that rank, learning the 2nd-rank spell at 3rd level, the 3rd-rank spell at 5th level, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard Psi Cantrips </strong> These are two common cantrips you automatically gain at 1st level. While these are the same cantrips used by other spellcasters, you cast them as psi cantrips, enabling you to amp them for greater effect. Your mastery of psychic magic also grants you a passive benefit that applies every time you cast these cantrips, even when you haven't amped them. These benefits apply only with cantrips you gain from your conscious mind; you would cast a cantrip you gained with your psychic spellcasting class feature, for example, as normal even if it appears in a different conscious mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique Psi Cantrips</strong> These psi cantrips are unique to your conscious mind. You automatically gain the surface psi cantrip at 1st level, automatically gain the deeper psi cantrip at 6th level, and automatically gain the deepest psi cantrip at 10th level.</p>"
