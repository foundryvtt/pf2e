            "value": "<p>Your thesis maintains that early and intense adoption of staves from the first days of study can create a symbiotic bond between spellcaster and staff, allowing them to create remarkable magic together. You've formed such a connection with a makeshift staff you built, and you are ready to infuse any staff you encounter with greater power.</p>\n<p>You begin play with a makeshift staff of your own invention. It has the magical trait and contains one cantrip and one 1st-rank spell, both from your spellbook. During your daily preparations, you can expend one spell to grant the staff a number of charges equal to that spell's rank, which dissipate after 24 hours. While you are holding the staff, you can Cast the Spells it contains. The 1st-rank spell consumes 1 charge but the cantrip doesn't require charges.</p>\n<p>You can Craft your makeshift staff into any other type of magical staff for the new staff's usual cost, adding the two spells you originally chose to the staff you Craft. This staff gains charges from preparing it along with expended spells.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, you can expend two spells instead of one when preparing any staff, adding additional charges equal to the combined ranks of the expended spells. At 16th level, you can expend up to a total of three spells to add charges to the staff, adding additional charges equal to the combined ranks of all three spells.</p>"
