            "value": "<p>Your bloodline grants you bloodline spells, special spells unique to your lineage. Bloodline spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don't need to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots; you can't cast them using spell slots. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points. The full rules are on page 298 of Player Core. You learn the initial bloodline spell, which is unique to your bloodline.</p><h3>Reading a Bloodline Entry</h3><p>A bloodline entry contains the following information.</p>\n<p><strong>Tradition</strong> You use this magical tradition and spell list</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Skills</strong> You become trained in the listed skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Sorcerous Gifts</strong> You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, as described in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Spell Repertoire (Sorcerer)]{Spell Repertoire} feature. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a 1st-rank spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that rank.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Spells</strong> You automatically gain the initial bloodline spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the Advanced Bloodline and Greater Bloodline feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Blood Magic</strong> Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using a Focus Point or a sorcerous gift spell using a spell slot, you choose one blood magic effect you know to benefit from. You begin play with the benefit listed in your bloodline and can gain others through sorcerer feats.</p>\n<p>If the blood magic effect offers a choice, make it before resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects and, against a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references to spell rank refer to the rank of the spell you cast.</p>"
