Some bards are constantly moved by new muses or draw their inspiration from an idealized being, whether it's based on a real person or purely philosophical. If your muse is a single creature, it might be an eclectic creature like a fey or one who's learned a lot over a long lifespan; if a deity, it might be Desna or Calistria. Art inspired by a polymath muse is restless, with each composition exhibiting new techniques and an ever-evolving style.</p>\n<p>As a bard with a polymath muse, you are interested in a wide array of topics but rarely dedicated to any one, and you rarely make up your mindâ€”you want to try everything.</p>\n<p><strong>Muse Feat</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Versatile Performance]</p>\n<p><strong>Muse Spell</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Phantasmal Minion]</p>"
