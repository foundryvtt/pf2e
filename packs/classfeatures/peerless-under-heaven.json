If you already had access to the critical specialization effect for this weapon, your weapon gains the additional critical specialization effect of the grievous rune.</p>\n<p>After you Spark Transcendence, your impeccable battle form strikes fear. An enemy of your choice within 30 feet must succeed at a @Check[will|against:class] save against your class DC or be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 1}. That creature is then temporarily immune to this effect for 10 minutes. This is an emotion, fear, mental, and visual effect.</p>"
