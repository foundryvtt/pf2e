These apparitions are drawn to animists who are orderly and responsible, and they can give such hosts access to spells that alter a target's timeline or removes them from the current timeline, reveal visions of past or future events, or even accelerate magical effects to a point in time where they have already ended.</p>\n<p><strong>Apparition Skills</strong> Fortune-Telling Lore, Genealogy Lore</p>\n<p><strong>Apparition Spells</strong> Cantrip figment; 1st déjà vu PC2 ; 2nd dispel magic; 3rd curse of lost time PC2 ; 4th vision of death; 5th illusory scene; 6th phantasmal calamity; 7th retrocognition; 8th quandary; 9th foresight</p>\n<p><strong>Vessel Spell</strong> store time</p>\n<p><strong>Avatar</strong> Devourer of Lost Time Speed 30 feet, fly Speed 50 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Melee</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> devour potential (reach 15 feet, void),</p>\n<p><strong>Damage</strong> 6d10+6 void</p>\n<p><strong>Ranged</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> scream of loss (range 120 feet, void),</p>\n<p><strong>Damage</strong> 6d6+6 void</p>"
