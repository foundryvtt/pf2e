This allows you efficient access to various spellshape effects.</p>\n<p>You gain one 1st-rank spellshape wizard feat of your choice. Starting at 4th level, during your daily preparations, you can gain a spellshape wizard feat of your choice that has a level requirement of no more than half your level, which you can use until your next daily preparations.</p>"
