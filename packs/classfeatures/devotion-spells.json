Choose either @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Shields of the Spirit] or a spell based on your deity's divine font (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Lay on Hands] if your deity allows <em>heal</em>, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Touch of the Void] if your deity allows <em>harm</em>).</p>\n<p>It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first devotion spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes.</p>\n<p>Your devotion spells are divine spells. Your spellcasting attribute is Charisma.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points.</p>"
