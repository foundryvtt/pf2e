This effect has the water trait.</p>\n<p>When you Spark Transcendence, you can Step, your body carried along by a surging tide. If your transcendence affected an enemy, you can instead move that enemy 5 feet in a direction of your choice unless it succeeds at a @Check[fortitude|against:class] save against your class DC. If you move an enemy who started out adjacent to you, you can Step into the space it vacated.</p>"
