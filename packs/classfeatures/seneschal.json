You must select @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Seneschal Witch Dedication] as your 2nd-level class feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> You must be a witch who has lost contact with your patron.</p>\n<p><strong>Adjustments:</strong> Instead of your patron's lesson, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Manifest Will] hex cantrip and your familiar learns one common 1st-rank spell of your choice from your spell list.</p>"
