As you learn how to tap into that power, you influence your familiar to mold the power by itself, continuing to learn new spells and provide you with other witch class features.</p>\n<p>Without your patron watching over your power, you gain more control but also miss important lessons. You must select Seneschal Witch Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> You must be a witch who has lost contact with your patron.</p>\n<p><strong>Adjustments:</strong> Instead of your patron's lesson, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Manifest Will] hex cantrip and your familiar learns one common 1st-rank spell of your choice from your spell list.</p>"
