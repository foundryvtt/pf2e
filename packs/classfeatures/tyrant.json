These creatures take only minimum damage (typically 3 damage at 11th level, 4 at 12th, 5 at 16th, and 6 at 19th), and the effects they take can't be adjusted by anything that changes your Iron Command.</p>\n<p>For instance, the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Iron Repercussions] feat couldn't turn the damage into per @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Persistent Damage]{Persistent Mental Damage} for creatures other than the triggering creature.</p>"
