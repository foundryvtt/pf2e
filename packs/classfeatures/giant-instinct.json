If you're not Small or Medium, you can use a weapon built for a creature one size larger than you. You gain access to this larger weapon, of any weapon type otherwise available at character creation. It has the normal Price and Bulk for a weapon of its size. When wielding such a weapon in combat, increase your additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6, but you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1} condition because of the weapon's unwieldy size. You can't remove this clumsy condition or ignore its penalties by any means while wielding the weapon.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Specialization Ability<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Increase the damage from Rage when using a larger weapon from 6 to 10; if you have greater weapon specialization, increase it from 10 to 18.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Raging Resistance<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You resist bludgeoning damage and your choice of cold, electricity, or fire, chosen when you gain raging resistance.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Note: You need to manually apply Clumsy 1 when you enter rage.
