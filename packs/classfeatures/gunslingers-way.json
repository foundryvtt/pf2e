You also gain advanced and greater deeds at later levels, as well as access to way-specific feats.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Way of the Drifter]</strong> You wander across the battlefield, equally at home in and out of the fray.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Way of the Pistolero]</strong> You carefully maintain your distance at a duelist's 10 paces with pistol in hand.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Way of the Sniper]</strong> You practice a methodical style of shooting, striking from far cover.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Way of the Vanguard]</strong> You rely on a brutal combat style that uses heavy weapons and explosive attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Way of the Triggerbrand]</strong> You prefer firearms that work well as weapons in both melee and ranged combat</p>"
