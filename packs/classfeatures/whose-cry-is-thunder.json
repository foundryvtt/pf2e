When you critically succeed on a Strike, a thunderclap booms! The target must make a Fortitude saving throw against your class DC. On a failure, they are knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Deafened] for 1 minute. This is a sonic effect.</p>\n<p>When you Spark Transcendence, you can choose to become electrically charged until the start of your next turn. Any creature that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon while you're charged takes @Damage[1d6[electricity]] damage as lightning courses back to them.</p>"
