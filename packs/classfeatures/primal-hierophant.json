You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using druid spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Hierophant's Power] feat to gain a second slot.</p>"
