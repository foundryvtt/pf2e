Each time you're critically hit while wearing the armor, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:13]. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. This isn't cumulative with fortification runes or other abilities that reduce critical hits with a flat check. Additionally, you gain resistance 2 + half your level against precision damage.</p>"
