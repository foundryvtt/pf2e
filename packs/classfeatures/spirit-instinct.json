If you choose to deal negative or positive damage, your weapon or unarmed attack gains the effects of the ghost touch property rune, which makes it more effective against incorporeal creatures, and your Rage action gains the divine and necromancy traits, plus negative or positive, as appropriate.</p>\n<h2>Specialization Ability<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>When using spirit rage, increase the damage from Rage from 3 to 7. If you have greater weapon specialization, instead increase the damage when using spirit rage to 13.</p>\n<h2>Raging Resistance<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You resist negative damage, as well as damage dealt by the attacks and abilities of undead creatures, regardless of the damage type.</p>"
