When you critically succeed on a Strike and the target of the critical hit is standing on a surface of earth or stone, the target is driven down and mired in the ground. The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] and must succeed at an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] attempt against your class DC to end the immobilization. The creature doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes), has a burrow speed, or could otherwise escape without effort.</p>\n<p>When you Spark Transcendence while standing on a surface of earth or stone, you can choose to shatter the surface in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10], making it difficult terrain. You are not affected by this difficult terrain.</p>"
