Over time, this makes the most vulnerable sections of your body harder and more resistant to damage. Many steelskin hobgoblins intentionally use blades and flame to scar themselves in intricate patterns, though this isn't universal. Your flat check to recover from persistent physical (including bleed), energy, or poison damage is @Check[type:flat|dc:13]{DC 13} (rather than DC 15), or @Check[type:flat|dc:8]{DC 8} when provided particularly effective assistance.</p>"
