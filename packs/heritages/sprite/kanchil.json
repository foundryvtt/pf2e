You become trained in Deception (or another skill if you were already trained in Deception). You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Lie when specifically attempting to avoid danger or punishment (such as trying to convince a dragon not to eat you), to Deception DCs against @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sense Motive] checks to uncover such lies, and to initiative rolls when you roll Deception for initiative.</p>"
