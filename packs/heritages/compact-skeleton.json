These smaller, nimbler skeletons fit well in a traveling chest, can be forced through tight spaces, and more easily avoid detection. Your size is Small instead of Medium. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Quick Squeeze] feat, even if you aren't trained in Acrobatics. Tight spaces not tight enough to require the Squeeze activity aren't difficult terrain for you.</p>"
