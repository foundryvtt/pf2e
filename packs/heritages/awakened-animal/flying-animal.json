What used to be an automatic process is now one that you must apply some thought to until it becomes automatic once again. You can still slow your descent, so you take no damage from falling, regardless of the distance you fall. Most flying awakened animals choose the Take Flight ancestry feat at 1st level to regain a limited ability to fly. You have a land Speed of 20 feet and one animal attack of your choice (typically beak, claw, jaws, talon, or wing).</p>"
