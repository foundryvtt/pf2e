You may spend much of your time in the water like an alligator, seal, whale, or dolphin, or you may require the water to breathe like a fish or some crustaceans.</p>\n<p>You have one animal attack of your choice (typically claw, jaws, or tail; see the sidebar). Choose if you are aquatic or water-dwelling.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aquatic:</strong> You gain the aquatic trait and you have a swim Speed of 30 feet. The aquatic trait means you breathe water but not air, and your bludgeoning and slashing unarmed Strikes don't take the usual â€“2 penalty for being underwater.</li>\n<li><strong>Water-dwelling:</strong> You can hold your breath underwater for 10 minutes before needing air. You have a swim Speed of 20 feet, and if you can move on land, you have base Speed of 20 feet.</li>\n</ul>"
