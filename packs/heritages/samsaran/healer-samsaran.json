If you would automatically become trained in Medicine (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.</p>\n<p>When you use Medicine to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Treat Wounds] on yourself, you can use your special techniques to add your level to the Hit Points you regain from the treatment.</p>"
