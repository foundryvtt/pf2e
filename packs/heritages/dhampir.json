You have the void healing ability, which means you are harmed by vitality damage and healed by void effects as if you were undead. You also gain @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.Low-Light Vision], or you gain @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.Darkvision] if your ancestry already has low-light vision.
