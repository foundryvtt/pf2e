You have the void healing ability, which means you are harmed by vitality damage and healed by void effects as if you were undead. You also gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision. You can choose from dhampir feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.</p>"
