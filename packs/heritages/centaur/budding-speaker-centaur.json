If you selected divine, you're a Faithspeaker. If you selected primal, you're a Greenspeaker. This choice can't be changed. You gain one cantrip from the chosen spell list. You can cast this spell as an innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.</p>"
