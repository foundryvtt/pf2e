Your people connect sarangay communities to one another across vast distances and are symbolized by the half moon, which conjoins the light and dark; so too do you conjoin the dark from the bright, the red from the blue, the wind from the sea. Your ancestors were tall and burly with shiny black fur, light spots or markings, and short, tightly curved horns. You become trained in two Lore skills of your choice, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Recall Knowledge checks using those skills.</p>"
