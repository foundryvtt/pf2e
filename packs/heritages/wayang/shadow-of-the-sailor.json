You can attempt to walk along the surface of flowing water as well, still moving at half Speed, but to do so, you must succeed at an Acrobatics check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Balance] using the DC of a Swim check to move through the water; on a failure, you fall into the water. This Acrobatics check doesn't use an action.</p>"
