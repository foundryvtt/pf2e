This gives you a strong, muscular core and lowers your center of gravity—features that assist you in riding and climbing—and you've trained at riding in a saddle from an extremely early age. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ride] feat. Additionally, you are not @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] while you Climb.</p>"
