The coral plates are medium armor in the plate armor group that grant a +4 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of –2, a Speed penalty of –5 feet, a Strength value of +3, and have the aquadynamic and comfort traits. You can never wear other armor or remove the coral. You can etch armor runes onto the coral.</p>"
