You gain darkvision.</p>\n<p>Your body is dotted with phosphorescent spots that emit a guiding light and help you communicate. The spots - located primarily on your face, arms, and hands - illuminate a 10-foot radius around you with dim light. You can activate, deactivate, or change the arrangement of lights as an action, which has the concentration trait.</p>"
