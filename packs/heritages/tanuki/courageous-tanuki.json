Whenever you gain the fleeing condition, you also gain a +10-foot circumstance bonus to your Speeds that lasts as long as youâ€™re fleeing. When you have the fleeing condition, instead of having to spend all your actions trying to escape, you can act normally for one action but must still spend the remainder of your actions fleeing. You also gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Tactical Retreat] ability.</p>"
