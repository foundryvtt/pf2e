The GM will usually double the range if you're downwind from something you're trying to smell or halve the range if you're upwind. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks whenever you're trying to locate food, drink, or a consumable item that's ingested (such as a potion or elixir) using your scent.</p>"
