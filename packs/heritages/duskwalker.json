You gain the duskwalker trait in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You also gain @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.Low-Light Vision], or you gain @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.Darkvision] if your ancestry already has low-light vision. Neither your body nor your spirit can ever become undead. You can choose from duskwalker feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.</p>"
