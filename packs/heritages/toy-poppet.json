Like other Tiny creatures, you don't automatically receive lesser cover from being in a larger creature's space, but circumstances might allow you to Take Cover. You can purchase weapons, armor, and other items for your size with the same statistics as normal gear, except that melee weapons have a reach of 0 for you (or a reach 5 feet shorter than normal if they have the reach trait). You can enter another creature's space, which is important because you must usually enter a creature's space to attack it with melee Strikes! Remember to adjust the Bulk of items and your Bulk limit for Tiny size.</p>"
