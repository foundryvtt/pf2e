You gain cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1), and you treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on). You don't need to succeed at a flat check to target a concealed creature if that creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] only by snow. Unless you wear protective gear or take shelter, environmental heat effects are one step more extreme for you.</p>"
