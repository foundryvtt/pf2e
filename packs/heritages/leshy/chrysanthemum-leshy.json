These petals have medicinal properties, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against poison.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, during your daily preparations, you can harmlessly pluck a few petals from your head and steep them in fresh water to create a single @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Antidote (Lesser)]{Lesser Antidote}, which takes the form of a tea. At level 6, you instead create a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Antidote (Moderate)]{Moderate Antidote}; at level 10, a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Antidote (Greater)]{Greater Antidote}; and at level 14, a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Antidote (Major)]{Major Antidote}. The tea loses its effectiveness if not consumed before your next daily preparations.</p>"
