If a creature affected by the facade leaves the area, any illusions affecting it fade after 1 day.

It can have the appearance of any mundane environment or structure, such as a glorious cathedral, a clearing in a forest, a comfortably furnished cavern, or anything else one can imagine. All demiplanes have finite, unbreachable boundaries, which might resemble stone, wood, or something more unnatural, such as a wall of mist or unceasing void.</p>\n<p>Demiplanes have environmental conditions as appropriate for the Material Plane, though the primary caster can dictate a general climate or light level, as well as whether the demiplane experiences seasons or a day-night cycle. The demiplane has no native plants or animals, but they can be introduced, and plants will grow in a demiplane's light.</p>\n<p>When you first cast create demiplane, the casters are teleported to the demiplane. The demiplane has no direct access to other worlds, so <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Interplanar Teleport]</em> or similar abilities are necessary to access it. As part of casting the ritual to create a new demiplane, you create a key to the demiplane which serves as a plane shift tuning fork for that demiplane. Most resemble ornate keys, but some take the forms of maps, compasses, or dowsing rods.</p>\n<p>If you have the original key to an existing demiplane and are on that demiplane, you can instead use this ritual to either expand the demiplane or add special traits or features.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Alignment</strong> The demiplane gains one alignment trait, such as lawful or good.</li>\n<li><strong>Bounteous</strong> The demiplane has a functional ecosystem, with plants and animals appropriate to the environment. This ecosystem doesn't require any additional effort on your part to maintain.</li>\n<li><strong>Elemental</strong> The demiplane gains the air, earth, fire, or water planar essence trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Gravity</strong> The demiplane gains a gravity trait of your choice.</li>\n<li><strong>Key</strong> You create an additional key that can be used to access the demiplane with plane shift and improve it with create demiplane.</li>\n<li><strong>Portal</strong> You create a permanent gateway between the demiplane and a single other location. You must spend the ritual's casting time constructing the gateway on the external side, which typically resembles an arch or doorway of some sort. The gate is always active, but it can be secured as you would any door.</li>\n<li><strong>Scope</strong> The demiplane can be unbounded instead of finite, though still with the same size.<hr /></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You create a new demiplane whose area consists of two contiguous squares, each 100 feet on a side. The ceiling is 20 feet high. If modifying an existing demiplane, you can instead either add this area to the demiplane's size or add two special traits or features.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the demiplane's area is a single square, 100 feet on a side and a ceiling 20 feet high. If modifying an existing demiplane, you can add one special trait or feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The ritual has no effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Something goes horribly wrong, and all casters are teleported to an unknown but likely hostile plane.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> The ritual creates a square area 1,000 feet on a side, with a ceiling 20 feet high (two contiguous areas of this size on a critical success).

While the tuning forks for most prominent planes are uncommon, just like the spell plane shift, more obscure planes and demiplanes often have rare tuning forks. The spell is highly imprecise, and you appear 1d20x25 miles from the last place one of the targets (of your choice) was located the last time that target traveled to the plane. If it's the first time traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you appear at a random location on the plane. Plane shift doesn't provide a means of return travel, though casting plane shift again allows you to return to your previous plane unless there are extenuating circumstances.</p>"

Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends and begins.

You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches any part of the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

                    "value": "<p>You enforce a magic rule on a willing target, forcing it to either perform or refrain from carrying out a certain act. A <em>geas</em> to perform an act is usually conditional, such as, \"Always offer hospitality to strangers seeking a place to stay.\" An unconditional <em>geas</em> to perform a certain act doesn't require the target to perform that act exclusively, though it must prioritize the task above all leisurely pursuits. The most common <em>geas</em> to refrain from carrying out an act is a specification to avoid violating a contract. In those cases, the secondary caster usually takes charge of making sure the wording of the contract is attuned correctly with the ritual's magic. Because the target is willing, <em>geas</em> can have a duration that lasts for as long as the target agrees to. If the target is unable to fulfill the <em>geas</em>, it becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1}, and the sickened condition increases by 1 for each consecutive day it is prevented from following the <em>geas</em>, to a maximum of sickened 4. The sickened condition ends immediately when it follows the <em>geas</em> again; it can't remove the sickened condition in any other way. Only powerful magic such as a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wish]</em> spell can remove the effects of <em>geas</em> from a willing target.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The <em>geas</em> succeeds, and the target receives a +1 status bonus to skill checks that directly uphold the <em>geas</em> (at the GM's discretion).</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The <em>geas</em> succeeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The <em>geas</em> fails.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The <em>geas</em> fails, and you are instead affected by the <em>geas</em> you were attempting to place on the target. You are considered an unwilling target, so the <em>geas</em> can be counteracted with a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Cleanse Affliction]</em> spell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> You can use <em>geas</em> on an unwilling creature; it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. If the target fails this Will save, the <em>geas</em> lasts up to 1 week. A <em>remove curse</em> spell can counteract a <em>geas</em> on an unwilling creature, in addition to powerful magic such as a <em>wish</em> spell. A clever unwilling creature can subvert the <em>geas</em> by contriving situations that prevent it from complying, but in that case it becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened] (as described above).</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> As 5th level, but the <em>geas</em> lasts for up to 1 year on an unwilling creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> As 5th level, but the <em>geas</em> lasts for a duration you choose (even unlimited) on an unwilling creature.</p>"

If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.</p>\n<p>In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC - 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster-for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage-the GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage.

            "publicNotes": "<p>The Lantern King is one of the Eldest-a pantheon of demigods whose rule over the First World is one of capriciousness that can be at times playful, enigmatic, bizarre, or even downright mean. For the most part, the Lantern King's plots and shenanigans tilt toward the cruel, and while he's long been a master at riding the proverbial razor's edge between mischief and outright sadism (if only by conserving his cruelest plans for those who invite that cruelty by being cruel themselves, as in the case of Nyrissa), his latest actions have certainly drawn the notice of the other Eldest. As such, they have largely distanced themselves from him, and as a result of this, any defeat the PCs deal to him in this adventure goes not only unpunished by the Lantern King's demigod siblings but will even be enforced, in a manner of speaking, by the other Eldest so that the Lantern King won't seek continued revenge against the PCs for their victories. Whether or not this also serves to teach the capricious eldest a lesson to temper his need for mischief with occasional bouts of patience and even mercy, only time can tell.</p>\n<p>The Lantern King's direct interactions with the PCs in this campaign are via an avatar-a powerful proxy created from himself to rule over the Lantern Kingdom. While this avatar isn't as powerful as the Lantern King himself, it remains the single most dangerous foe the party faces in Kingmaker. As a demigod, the Lantern King is an even more dangerous foe, equivalent in power to a 29th-level creature and possessing abilities beyond the scope of the core experience in the <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</em>. Some of these abilities, such as the power to manipulate reality, to create powerful artifacts like the <em>Apology</em>, and to build entire demiplane realms like the Hunting Dream or the Lantern Kingdom, manifest during the course of the <em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em> not as rules content but as story elements the PCs will need to endure-see Chapter 11 of this book for more details.</p>\n<p>In combat, the Lantern King's avatar uses flight to remain out of melee for the first several rounds of combat, relying upon his spells to soften up the party before using his Strikes against them. He's fond of taking actions that disrupt, torment, or mock the PCs rather than those specifically tailored to maximize damage. For example, he often uses Playful Switch to swap a flying PC in the air with one who's on the ground and can't fly, or he uses illusions to create false foes or locations that play off of previous failures or embarrassments the PCs may have endured during the campaign itself. By playing the Lantern King's avatar in battle as more of a trickster than a cold-blooded killer, you'll not only enforce his legendary personality upon your players, but you'll also give their characters a bit more of a fighting chance against him in battle. He prefers to hold <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Primal Phenomenon]</em> in reserve to recover from an unwanted condition or situation, and as he realizes the PCs are dangerous foes, he abandons \"playful tactics\" for more serious or tactical decisions aimed toward defeating the party rather than toying with them.</p>\n<p>While the Lantern King faces no lasting inconvenience if his avatar is slain, the sting of such a defeat is enough to compel the avatar to back down and ask for a truce if the PCs reduce him to fewer than 75 Hit Points. If the PCs agree to a truce, the avatar compliments their prowess and promises to turn his attentions away from the Stolen Lands. Furthermore, he agrees to any additional terms the PCs ask for, provided they are within his ability to grant. This includes restoring Nyrissa's place and realm to the First World (although he cannot provide further information about her lost lover) and unmaking <em>Briar </em>to restore her capacity to love.</p>",
