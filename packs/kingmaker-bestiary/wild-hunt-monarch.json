While the tuning forks for most prominent planes are uncommon, just like the spell plane shift, more obscure planes and demiplanes often have rare tuning forks. The spell is highly imprecise, and you appear 1d20x25 miles from the last place one of the targets (of your choice) was located the last time that target traveled to the plane. If it's the first time traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you appear at a random location on the plane. Plane shift doesn't provide a means of return travel, though casting plane shift again allows you to return to your previous plane unless there are extenuating circumstances.</p>"

Countless members of these fey compose the wild hunt-the term \"wild hunt\" refers to the family of creatures as a whole as well as to individual groups of these fey who gather to pursue their quarry.</p>\n<p>Wild hunt monarchs set the terms of each specific hunt, depending upon the prey and their own whims. The easier the prey, the more likely a monarch is to impose rules to make the hunt more entertaining, such as forbidding anyone but their hounds from injuring the quarry, or holding back their forces to give the target creature time to rest and recover.</p>\n<p>While most missions come from rumors gathered by a wild hunt monarch, monarchs occasionally consider proposals from the few who are brave and knowledgeable enough to seek them out. They accept tasks only from sources they deem worthy, and the payments they demand for their services vary significantly, though they have no interest in material wealth. Wild hunt monarchs take grave offense at unfavorable deals. Those who attempt to cheat a monarch often become the enraged fey's next target.</p>",
