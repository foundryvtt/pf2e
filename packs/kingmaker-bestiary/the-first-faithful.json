                    "value": "<p>You call forth an extraplanar creature of a level no greater than double that of the <em>planar binding</em> ritual's level and attempt to bargain with it. The secondary caster attempting the Crafting check creates a warding diagram to prevent the extraplanar creature from attacking or leaving during the bargain; if that caster fails or critically fails, then instead of the usual effects of a failure or critical failure of the secondary skill check, the extraplanar creature can attack or leave instead of negotiate. You can also leave out this step, removing the need for a Crafting check, with the same result (if you're summoning a good extraplanar creature you trust, for example). The creature can also attack or leave if you use any hostile action against it or if the warding diagram breaks. Once the diagram is complete, you and the secondary casters each take your places at specific points at the diagram's edge where power concentrates.</p>\n<p>You conjure the extraplanar creature within your wards and negotiate a deal with it, generally to perform a task for you in exchange for payment. A creature that doesn't wish to negotiate at all can attempt a Will save to stay on its home plane. Most good and neutral extraplanar creatures feel that they have something better to do than cater to the whims of mortals and require a significant gift, especially if your task poses significant risks. Evil extraplanar creatures are more likely to accept a bargain for a lower cost as long as it allows them to wreak havoc on the Material Plane or inflict evil upon the world along the way. Monetary prices usually range from the cost of a consumable item of the creature's level for a short and simple task to a permanent magic item of the creature's level or more to persuade the creature to fight alongside you. However, some extraplanar creatures may want payments other than money, such as permission to cast a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Geas] on you to fulfill an unspecified later favor or obtain ownership of your soul via an infernal contract. If you can't come to an agreement in a reasonable length of time after you've made your case, the extraplanar creature can return from whence it came at any time.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You call the extraplanar creature and bind it in the wards for up to a full day before it returns home, potentially allowing you to negotiate a better deal by threatening to leave it in the wards for the full day.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You call the extraplanar creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to call the extraplanar creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You call something dark and horrible, unbound by your wards, and it immediately attempts to destroy you.</p>"

The character can reselect all ancestry feats, or even select an entirely new ancestry (choosing from those allowed by the GM). The newly incarnated ancestry must still fully support other character build options; you can't choose feats or ancestries that would invalidate class choices. The character is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 10 minutes as they acclimate to their new body.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the transformation is disorienting to the creature, who must come to terms with their new body and the strange echoes of memories from the past life that fade in time. The creature becomes clumsy 1 and stupefied 1 for one week; these conditions can't be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The attempt to incarnate ancestry is unsuccessful.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the attempt to transform leaves the creature feeling as if their own body were unfamiliar. They become clumsy 1 and stupefied 1 for one week; these conditions can't be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed.</p>"

This worm shoots through the air to target two creatures within 30 feet, who must then attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:34] save. The First Faithful can't Release the Inmost Worm again for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The worm lands on the target and causes agonizing pain before dropping to the floor and fading away. The target takes @Damage[3d6[mental]] damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The worm lands on the target and burrows into their flesh, leaving no trace of a hole. The target seems to age rapidly for a moment, takes @Damage[6d6[mental]] damage, and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 round before the pain fades and the target returns to its actual age.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target also takes @Damage[6d6[persistent,mental]] damage. The target remains stupefied 1 as long as the mental damage persists, during which they appear to be aging rapidly. Once the persistent damage ends, the target's appearance reverts to normal.</p>"
