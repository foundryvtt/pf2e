Countless members of these fey compose the wild hunt-the term \"wild hunt\" refers to the family of creatures as a whole as well as to individual groups of these fey who gather to pursue their quarry.</p>\n<p>Wild hunt monarchs set the terms of each specific hunt, depending upon the prey and their own whims. The easier the prey, the more likely a monarch is to impose rules to make the hunt more entertaining, such as forbidding anyone but their hounds from injuring the quarry, or holding back their forces to give the target creature time to rest and recover.</p>\n<p>While most missions come from rumors gathered by a wild hunt monarch, monarchs occasionally consider proposals from the few who are brave and knowledgeable enough to seek them out. They accept tasks only from sources they deem worthy, and the payments they demand for their services vary significantly, though they have no interest in material wealth. Wild hunt monarchs take grave offense at unfavorable deals. Those who attempt to cheat a monarch often become the enraged fey's next target.</p>",
