If its partner goes too long without fighting, the sword misleads its wielder into believing they're the real Armag and that anyone around them who isn't obviously a member of their lineage or following is a mortal enemy. The cursed greatsword also slowly changes the features of the wielder over the course of several days or even weeks to appear as those of the original Armag. If left unchecked, these powers seemingly bring the warlord back to life-it's the wait for this subtle transformation to be complete that's kept the current \"Armag\" in meditation in the tomb for so long. The long-term effects on a PC as a result of this curse are left to the GM to adjudicate, but at the very least should result in a gradual shift of the PCs' alignment to chaotic neutral. If 24 hours pass without <em>Ovinrbaane</em> being used in an encounter of at least moderate difficulty, its partner becomes irritable and short-tempered, and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 2} until the end of their first turn in a moderate or more difficult combat.</p>\n<p><em>Ovinrbaane</em> is a <em>+2 striking wounding greatsword</em>.

How one can find their own gravestone in the Boneyard when they have yet to die and be judged, of course, can be a complex problem to solve, perhaps requiring the destroyer to first die, be judged, sent on to the afterlife, and then be restored to their original mortal life through the result of an epic quest by allies or the whims of a deity. Alternately, if <em>Ovinrbaane</em> is left unused for a hundred years, its magical powers grow dormant. At this time, the weapon can be destroyed normally, although it still has Hardness 30 and 120 Hit Points, and at the end of any round during which it is not destroyed, its dormant powers awaken again if it succeeds at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5]. Since the blade is currently active, this option doesn't present a particularly viable one for PCs seeking the artifact's destruction during the course of the Adventure Path- although sealing it away in a vault could be an excellent first step in this process, entrusting the final destruction of the dangerous artifact to some future generation of hero.</p>"

He has long forgotten his birth name, as well as much of his childhood, as his brief but overwhelming recent experiences forced these memories out of his mind to make room for bloodlust, an addiction to violence, and obsession with mayhem. Only his worship of Gorum remains today, yet even this has been corrupted-tainted by the fell influence of the Sisters of the Bloodshot Eye. Little remains in Armag's mind today save for a desire to conquer, to wield the mighty greatsword <em>Ovinrbaane</em> in battle, and to revel in the glory of war. While he claims to be the reborn ancient hero, his \"memories\" of this previous life are largely hallucinations and fantasies implanted by the influence of his weapon.</p>\n<p>Armag himself appears as a muscular human with unruly brown hair, a full beard, and an expression that seems incapable of any other visage than anger, wrath, or fury.</p>",
