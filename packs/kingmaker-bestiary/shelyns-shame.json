In addition to being filled with an urge to defeat the evil that has infested the shrine, the creature has the urge to restore the shrine. Exact details as to the nature of the evil infesting the shrine aren't apparent other than to alert the character that there's certainly something dire within the shrine's walls. The creature need not act on these urges, but as long as they pursue either goal, they gain a +1 status bonus to all checks while remaining in the shrine's area. The GM determines whether or not a check counts toward this goal (at the very least, all combat checks made against foes in the rest of the adventure count).</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Effect: Hope or Despair (Critical Success)]</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> Feelings of sadness and despair well up in the creature's mind. For the next hour, the creature takes a -1 penalty to all saving throws against mental effects; this penalty increases to a -2 penalty against emotion mental effects. This effect has the curse trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the effects persist as long as the green hag Tulvak remains in control of the shrine.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Effect: Hope or Despair (Failure or Critical Failure)]</p>"
