When you select this boon, it does not apply to your current character. Instead, select one of your Pathfinder Society characters with 0 XP. That character gains 12 XP, 12 Fame, 30 gp, and 12 Reputation to distribute among any number of legal factions.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can apply this benefit to the same character to whom you applied the Eager Protégé benefit, so long as that PC still has 12 XP. If you do so, you instead increase that character's XP by 12 (to 24 total), award them an additional 12 Reputation to distribute between one or more factions, and grant them an additional 45 gp (for a total of 75 gp).</p>"
