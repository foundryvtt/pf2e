            "value": "<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 4 AcP</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You have modified your @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder] to absorb a small amount of your exhaustion, allowing you to continue exploring unhindered. When you purchase this boon, you apply its benefits to one wayfinder in your possession, granting you a special ability when the wayfinder is invested and in your possession.</p>\n<p>As an action, you can reduce the severity of your @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened] condition, reducing that condition's value by 1.</p>\n<p>You can safely use this benefit once per adventure. You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the wayfinder at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a @Check[flat|dc:10]. On a success, the wayfinder is broken. On a failure, the wayfinder is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a wayfinder that's already been overcharged, the item is automatically destroyed (even if it has been repaired) and does not provide the activated benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: You can apply multiple upgrades to a single wayfinder. Each upgrade only affects one wayfinder in your possession, chosen when the boon is purchased. If a wayfinder has multiple upgrades on it, you can only safely use each ability once per scenario.</p>\n<p>If the wayfinder with this upgrade is destroyed, you can apply the upgrade to another wayfinder during Downtime for no additional cost beyond that of the wayfinder itself.</p>"
