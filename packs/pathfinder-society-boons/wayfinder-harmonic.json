When you slot this boon, you apply its benefits to one @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder] in your possession, granting you a special free action ability when the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder] is invested and in your possession.</p>\n<p>You can activate this ability as a free action before you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Aid] an ally. If you roll a success on the check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Aid], you instead get a critical success.</p>\n<p>You can safely use this benefit once per adventure.You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the wayfinder at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a @Check[type:flat|dc:10]. On a success, the wayfinder is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Broken]. On a failure, the wayfinder is destroyed. Trying to overcharge it twice destroys it.</p>"
