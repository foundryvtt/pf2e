This has the effects of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Faerie Fire], except the effect occurs in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10]{10-foot radius} centered around you.</p>\n<p>You can safely use this benefit once per adventure. You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the <em>wayfinder</em> at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a @Check[type:flat|dc:10]. On a success, the <em>wayfinder</em> is broken. On a failure, the <em>wayfinder</em> is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a <em>wayfinder</em> that's already been overcharged, the item is automatically destroyed (even if it has been repaired) and does not provide the activated benefit.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can apply multiple upgrades to a single <em>wayfinder</em>. Each upgrade only affects one <em>wayfinder</em> in your possession, chosen when the boon is purchased. If a <em>wayfinder</em> has multiple upgrades on it, you can only safely use each ability once per scenario.</p>\n<p>If the <em>wayfinder</em> with this upgrade is destroyed, you can apply the upgrade to another <em>wayfinder</em> during Downtime for no additional cost beyond that of the <em>wayfinder</em> itself.</p>"
