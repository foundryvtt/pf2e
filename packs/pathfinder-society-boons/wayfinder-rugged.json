When you slot this boon, you apply its benefits to one @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder] in your possession, granting you a special ability when the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder] is invested and in your possession.</p>\n<p>As an action, you can reduce the severity of your @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened] condition, reducing that condition's value by 1.</p>\n<p>You can safely use this benefit once per adventure. You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder] at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a @Check[type:flat|dc:10]. On a success, the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder] is broken. On a failure, the <em>wayfinder</em> is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder] that's already been overcharged, the item is automatically destroyed (even if it has been repaired) and does not provide the activated benefit.</p>"
