Each time you fulfill the requirements of this boon, mark it on your Chronicle sheet along with the associated Reputation Tier. Have the GM sign beside this notation. You can only earn additional Fame and Reputation with this boon for one character per scenario played, even if you have multiple characters who could benefit from this boon.</p>"
