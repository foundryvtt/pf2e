Any PCs benefiting from a Level Bump and whose levels are lower than yours can prepare one additional spell of their highest-rank spell slot or cast one additional spell of their highest-rank spell slot. When casting spells of a magical tradition that is the same as the tradition you use for spellcasting, the affected PC also increases the Level Bump's modifier to spell DCs to 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Normal</strong> A Level Bump increases a PC's spell DCs by 1, and it does not grant any additional spells prepared or spell slots.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> A PC can only benefit from two mentor boons.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Item.Effect: Magical Mentor Boon (PFS)]</p>"
