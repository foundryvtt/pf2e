Select an organization other than the Pathfinder Society. For the purpose of fulfilling prerequisites and access conditions, you are treated as being a member of that group in addition to your belonging to the Pathfinder Society.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: You can purchase this boon multiple times, but each time you purchase it, you relinquish your membership in the previous group in order to join a different group. Before doing so, you must retrain any options that listed membership in your previous group as a prerequisite.</p>"
