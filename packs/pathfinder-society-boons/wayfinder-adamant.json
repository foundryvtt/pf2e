When you slot this boon, you apply its benefits to one @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder] in your possession, granting you a special reaction ability when the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder] is invested and in your possession. You gain the following reaction:</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Resist Harm <span class=\"action-glyph\">R</span></p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You would take damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You gain resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, sonic, vitality, and void damage equal to 1 plus your reputation tier against one attack, spell, or effect. This applies only to the initial effect, not to any subsequent attacks or damage dealt by the effect (such as persistent damage or an ongoing hazard).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can safely use this benefit once per adventure. You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder] at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a @Check[type:flat|dc:10]. On a success, the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder] is broken. On a failure, the <em>wayfinder</em> is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder] that's already been overcharged, the item is automatically destroyed (even if it has been repaired) and does not provide the activated benefit.</p>"
