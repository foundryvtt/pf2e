In keeping with the Society's ethos of cooperation, generous Pathfinders spend some of their own time and resources tracking down other agents who could benefit more from these rewards. When you acquire this boon, select one Unique character option to which you've gained access through an adventure's Chronicle Sheet or via a no-cost boon from the online boon store (e.g., a listed magic item or a boon that allows you to acquire a special animal companion).</p>\n<p>Choose another of your characters. That character gains access to that special option instead, though they may only use the option once their level equals or exceeds the lowest level able to play the Chronicle Sheet's adventure (e.g., 5th level for Levels 5â€“8). The receiving PC must also meet any prerequisites for the boon (e.g., they must be Liked by a particular faction to access that faction's unique gear from Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide). On the Chronicle Sheet or Boon, write \"Bequeathed\" and the recipient character's number next to the option. You no longer have access to that option (and must retrain the character option or sell an item back for full cost if you acquired the option and would no longer qualify for it).</p>"
