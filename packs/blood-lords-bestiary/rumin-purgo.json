Both the duplicate and your invisibility persist for the spell's duration. Performing a hostile action doesn't end mislead's invisibility, just like a 4th-rank invisibility spell.

This doesn't fool anyone who's aware your duplicate is an illusion, nor does it work if the attack obviously couldn't have come from the duplicate. For instance, if you fired a ray, you could make it look like it came from the duplicate as long as the duplicate was positioned appropriately, but if you attacked with a sword and your duplicate was across the room from the target, your Deception check would automatically fail.</p>"
