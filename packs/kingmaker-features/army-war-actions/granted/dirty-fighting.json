Attempt a melee Strike or a ranged Strike against the AC of a target outflanked army that is not distant. Critical Success The target army becomes weary 2 until the start of your next turn. Success The target army becomes weary 1 until the start of your next turn. Critical Failure Your attack deals no damage to the target army, which is emboldened by your failed attempt at dirty fighting. This reduces the target army’s weary value by 1.</p>"
