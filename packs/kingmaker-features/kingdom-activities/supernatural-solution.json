Do so just before a Kingdom skill check is rolled (by yourself or any other PC).

This cost is paid now, whether or not you use your supernatural solution.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> Your attempt at researching a supernatural solution costs the kingdom [[/r 2d6 #RP]]{2d6 RP}, but is ultimately a failure, providing no advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but your spellcasters' resources and morale are impacted such that you cannot attempt a Supernatural Solution again for 2 Kingdom turns.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot influence a check with Supernatural Solution and Creative Solution simultaneously</p>"
