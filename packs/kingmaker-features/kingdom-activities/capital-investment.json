Your contribution generates economic activity in the form of RP that can be used during your current Kingdom turn or on the next Kingdom turn (your choice). You can use Capital Investment to repay funds from Tap Treasury. In this case, no roll is needed and you simply deduct the appropriate amount of funds from your personal wealth to pay back that which was borrowed. When you use Capital Investment to generate RP, the amount of gp required to make an investment is set by your kingdom's level. Investments below this amount cause your attempt at Capital Investment to suffer an automatic critical failure, while investments above this amount are lost. The investment required is equal to the value listed on Table 10â€“9: Party Treasure by Level in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook; use the value for your kingdom's level under the \"Currency per Additional PC\" as the required investment value. This is a basic @Check[trade|dc:resolve(@kingdom.control.dc)] check.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Your kingdom reaps the benefits of your investment.
