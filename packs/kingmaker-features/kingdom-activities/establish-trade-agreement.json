You send a band of merchants out to establish a trade agreement between your kingdom and a group with whom you've established diplomatic relations.

If your kingdom's proficiency rank in Magic is Master or higher, you can attempt a Magic check. Otherwise, attempt a Trade check. The check's DC is either the group's Negotiation DC (see sidebar) or your kingdom's Control DC, whichever is higher.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You successfully establish a trade agreement with your target, and your merchants return with gifts!
