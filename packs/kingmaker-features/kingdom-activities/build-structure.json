Select the appropriate number of contiguous buildable lots in a single block as specified by the structure's entry and spend the specified RP and Commodity cost. Then attempt the structure's skill check. You can also use this activity to attempt to repair a structure that was damaged as the result of an event but hasn't been replaced by Rubble. To do this, first spend half the structure's listed RP and Commodity cost, and then attempt the specified check. The existing structure gives you a +2 item bonus to the check. On a success, record the new construction on the Urban Grid. Unless the structure's entry states otherwise, its effects are immediate; if the structure adjusts a Ruin's point total, adjust it upon construction.</p>"
