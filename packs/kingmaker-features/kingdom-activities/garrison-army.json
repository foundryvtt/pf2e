If you're garrisoning the army in a settlement, attempt a basic @Check[politics|dc:resolve(@kingdom.control.dc)] check.

Additionally, the efficiency of the garrisoning reduces this army's Consumption by 2 (to a minimum of 1) until it is deployed.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The army becomes fortified until it is deployed.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The army becomes fortified until the next Kingdom turn begins, at which point you must use this activity again to maintain the fortified condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your army clashes with local citizens, abuses their authority, lets their watchful readiness slack, and/or provokes confrontations where they are not needed. It does not become fortified, and you cannot attempt to garrison that army at this location again for 4 Kingdom turns. Increase Unrest by 1.</p>"
