Attempt a basic @Check[intrigue|dc:resolve(@kingdom.control.dc)], @Check[politics|dc:resolve(@kingdom.control.dc)], @Check[statecraft|dc:resolve(@kingdom.control.dc)], or @Check[warfare|dc:resolve(@kingdom.control.dc)] skill check—while any of these skills can be used, each skill is particularly suited to assigning two specific leadership roles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intrigue: Grants a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to assign Emissaries and Treasurers.</li>\n<li>Politics: Grants a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to assign Counselors and Rulers.</li>\n<li>Statecraft: Grants a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to assign Magisters and Viceroys.</li>\n<li>Warfare: Grants a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to assign Generals and Wardens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rulers are particularly difficult to assign; when you take this activity to assign a new Ruler, you take a –4 circumstance penalty to the skill check, and unless you achieve a critical success, you gain 1 additional Unrest.

The leader immediately provides the benefits tied to occupying the new role.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The people are unsure about the new leader. The leader takes a –1 circumstance penalty to all checks they attempt as part of their activities during the Activity phase of each Kingdom turn. At the end of the next Kingdom turn, the leader can attempt any Loyalty-based basic skill check to ingratiate themselves with the populace. The leader may attempt this check at the end of each Kingdom turn until they succeed. Success removes this penalty, but a critical failure results in the development detailed in Critical Failure below.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The people reject the new leader. The leadership role is treated as vacant and you must attempt to reassign it using the New Leadership activity at the start of the next Kingdom turn. Unrest increases by 1.</p>"
