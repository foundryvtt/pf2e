Alternately, you can simply send your spies out to investigate the current health of your kingdom. Attempt a basic @Check[intrigue|dc:resolve(@kingdom.control.dc)] check.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You learn something valuable or helpful. If you were infiltrating a specific target, the GM decides what is learned, but the information is exact and precise. For example, if you were infiltrating an unexplored ruin, you might learn that the site is infested with web lurkers and spider swarms. If you were investigating your kingdom's health, your spies reveal easy methods to address citizen dissatisfaction, allowing you to choose one of the following: reduce Unrest by 1d4 or reduce a Ruin of your choice by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You learn something helpful about the target, but the information is vague and imprecise. For example, if you were infiltrating the same ruin mentioned in the critical success above, you might learn that some sort of aberration uses the ruins as its lair. If you were investigating your kingdom's health, your spies learn enough that you can take action. Reduce your kingdom's Unrest by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> Your spies fail to learn anything of import, but they are not themselves compromised.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You never hear from your spies again, but someone certainly does! You take a â€“2 circumstance penalty on all kingdom checks until the end of the next Kingdom turn as counter-infiltration from an unknown enemy tampers with your kingdom's inner workings.</p>"
