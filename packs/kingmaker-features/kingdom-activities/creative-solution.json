Do so when a Kingdom skill check is rolled, but before you learn the result. Immediately reroll that check with a +2 circumstance bonus; you must take the new result. If you don't use your Creative Solution by the end of this turn, you lose this benefit and gain 10 kingdom XP instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the Creative Solution costs the kingdom 1d4 RP to research. This cost is paid now, whether or not you use your Creative Solution.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> Your attempt at researching a Creative Solution costs the kingdom 2d6 RP but is ultimately a failure. It provides no advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but your scholars and thinkers are so frustrated that you take a â€“1 circumstance penalty to Culture-based checks until the end of the next Kingdom turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot influence a check with Supernatural Solution and Creative Solution simultaneously.</p>"
