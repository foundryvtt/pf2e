Shaken always has a numerical value. The army’s Morale checks take a circumstance penalty equal to its shaken value, and whenever the army takes damage, it must succeed on a DC 11 flat check or its shaken value increases by 1. An army that becomes shaken 4 is automatically routed. An army reduces the value of this condition by 1 each Kingdom turn that passes during which it does not attempt an Army activity or engage in a war encounter.</p>"
