A defeated army can be restored to 1 Hit Point with the Recover Army activity (although the basic DC is increased by 5 for this check). Any effect that restores a defeated army to at least 1 Hit Point removes the defeated condition. A defeated army can only be moved one hex at a time with the Deploy Army activity. A defeated army can be Disbanded normally. It can’t be used for any other Army activity as long as it remains defeated. If a defeated army takes damage, it must succeed at a DC 16 flat check or be destroyed. If all armies on a side are defeated, those armies are destroyed.</p>"
