            "value": "<p>When an army has zero Hit Points, it becomes defeated. A defeated army cannot take war actions. A defeated army can be restored to 1 Hit Point with the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.Recover Army] activity (although the basic DC is increased by 5 for this check). Any effect that restores a defeated army to at least 1 Hit Point removes the defeated condition. A defeated army can only be moved one hex at a time with the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.Deploy Army] activity. A defeated army can be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.Disband Army] normally. It can't be used for any other Army activity as long as it remains defeated. If a defeated army takes damage, it must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:16] or be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.Destroyed]. If all armies on a side are defeated, those armies are destroyed.</p>"
