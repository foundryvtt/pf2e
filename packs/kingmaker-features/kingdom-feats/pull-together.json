Once per Kingdom turn when you roll a critical failure on a Kingdom skill check, attempt a DC 11 flat check. If this succeeds, your citizens heed the call to put in extra work to mitigate the disaster; treat the Kingdom skill check result as failure instead. The DC of this flat check increases by 5 each time you subsequently use it, but it decreases by 1 (to a minimum of 11) for each Kingdom turn that passes when you do not use it.</p>"
