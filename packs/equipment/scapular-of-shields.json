Each time you're critically hit while wearing the scapular, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:17]. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. When you invest the scapular, you either increase your Constitution score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You're critically hit with an attack</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The shield on your scapular glows with light, helping reduce the effectiveness of the attack.
