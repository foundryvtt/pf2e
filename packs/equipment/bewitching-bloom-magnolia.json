Your ally seems more charming, though no one can pinpoint why. They gain a +1 status bonus to Diplomacy checks for 10 minutes. Once on their next turn, the ally can attempt to draw a creature's attention. To do so, the ally must spend 1 action (which has the emotion, mental, and visual traits) to select a creature the ally can see and make eye contact in a way the target can see. The target must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:20] save or be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fascinated] with your ally until the end of that ally's next turn. If the save succeeds or the effect ends, the target is temporarily immune to being fascinated by any <em>magnolia bewitching bloom</em> for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Bewitching Bloom (Magnolia)]</p>"
