These clamps allow you to attach the gyroscopic stabilizer to any one-handed firearm as an Interact action.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The gyroscopic stabilizer is attached to a one-handed firearm without the fatal or fatal aim traits</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The gyroscopic stabilizer begins spinning for 1 minute. While the gyroscopic stabilizer is spinning, the weapon it's attached to gains the fatal aim weapon trait with a die one size larger than its damage die (maximum d12). This allows you to wield it in two hands to grant it the fatal trait.</p>"
