While wielded, you gain cold resistance 2, and you treat the effects of environmental cold as one degree lower. Heavenly rolling flames can be Activated only if you wield two of them, and Activating them counts against the frequency for both weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Rolling Flight</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You attach the wheels to your feet, and their constant movement and energy allow you to move through the air. You gain a fly Speed of 20 feet for 10 minutes. While in use in this way, you can't wield the wheels as weapons. You can spend an Interact action at any time to end this effect and re-grip the heavenly rolling flames. If you lack enough free hands to wield them, you drop them in your space.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Speed of Heaven</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Haste] as a 3rd-rank occult spell, but you can target only yourself.</p>"
