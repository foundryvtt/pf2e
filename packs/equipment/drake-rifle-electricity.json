            "value": "<p>A drake rifle is a firearm made from the saliva glands of a drake. The firearm launches small bursts of empowered spittle instead of typical rounds of ammunition. A drake rifle is a +1 weapon. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals 1d10 acid damage with a range increment of 150 feet and reload 1. On a critical hit, the spittle clings to the target and they take persistent damage of the same type as the weapon equal to [[/r (1d4 + @item.system.damage.dice)[persistent,electricity]]]{1d4 + the number of weapon damage dice}. A drake rifle does not add critical specialization effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> Interact (evocation, magical)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You fire a large, specialized burst designed to hamper your foes. Make a ranged Strike with the drake rifle. As long as the Strike isn't a critical failure, the drake rifle deals [[/r (1[splash])[electricity]]]{1 splash damage} per weapon damage die to the target and creatures within 5 feet of the target. On a hit, the drake rifle provides the following additional effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Electricity</strong> Small bursts of electricity continue to spark and jolt the target. The target becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] for [[/r 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> The initial raw materials must include the saliva glands of a ritually hunted drake with a breath weapon that deals the appropriate damage type for the drake rifle</p>"
