The light has a duration of 1 minute, but you can extinguish the light with an Interact action. A creature that begins its turn in the light must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:26] save.

If the creature ends its movement adjacent to you, it is slowed 1 until it is out of the light or until you make a Strike against it.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] against the first Strike you make against it while it is slowed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> The initial raw materials must include the scales and hide of a mamlambo.</p>"
