Clockwork mechanisms can swap between the lenses rapidly as needed. However, many of these lenses can only capture a single stimulus once and then are forever etched with it, making them unsuitable for long-term use. When activated, the clockwork mechanism on the goggles rapidly switches between the different lenses, granting you the benefits of all of them for a brief period of time.</p>\n<p>When activated, you gain low-light vision, darkvision, and the effects of <em>See invisibility</em> for 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Clockwork Goggles (Major)]</p>"
