You gain blood sight as a precise sense with a duration of 1 hour. Blood sight has a range of 60 feet and allows you to detect living creatures who are taking persistent bleed damage or who have the dying or wounded conditions. You also detect free-standing puddles or droplets of recently spilled blood. At the GM's discretion, living creatures without blood can't be detected with your blood sight.</p>\n<p>Your blood sight is especially accurate, allowing you to also detect creatures whose Hit Points are currently at half or less of their maximum. When you detect a creature with blood sight, you get a vague approximation of the value of the creature's bleed damage, dying condition, or wounded condition. This approximation can be noticed as \"excessive bleeding,\" a creature being \"near death,\" or some other general sense that doesn't give the exact value.</p>"
