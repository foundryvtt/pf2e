Once a beautiful and artistically wrought weapon, a <em>sunken pistol</em> is coated in a fine layer of dried salt and encrusted with barnacles. Each shot fired from this <em>+1 striking dragon mouth pistol</em> is now coated in a layer of salty ectoplasm and has the effects of a ghost touch rune. You can shoot the <em>sunken pistol</em> underwater, even when using black powder ammunition.</p>\n<p>A <em>sunken pistol</em> urges you to amass a horde of treasure even a dragon would be proud of. The methods used to acquire these riches matter not to the greedy pirate pistol, so long as you amass and hoard excessive wealth. Above all else, a <em>sunken pistol</em> desires the return of its own treasure, which might rest in the wreck of its sunken ship's hold or be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] on a dangerous island.</p>\n<p>In pursuit of treasure, a <em>sunken pistol</em> offers nautical and navigation advice to you, though it refuses such aid during less lucrative ventures. If you prove a profitable partner, the <em>sunken pistol</em> aids you in combat by Demoralizing your opponents (see the first Activation below). If you prove charitable or unwilling to retrieve its treasure, the <em>sunken pistol</em> turns its ire on you, Demoralizing you during combat until you relent. If you repeatedly refuse the <em>sunken pistol</em>, it would be wise to not accept water breathing from it, as it might attempt to drown you to allow a more suitable wielder to acquire it from your corpse. The <em>sunken pistol</em> can use the following activations.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>sunken pistol</em> curses and insults a creature it can see, attempting an Intimidation check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Demoralize] that creature.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>sunken pistol</em> casts water breathing on you as a 3rd-rank arcane spell. The <em>sunken pistol</em> can Dismiss this spell, so be sure to keep the gun happy if you're relying on its good graces to breathe!</p>"
