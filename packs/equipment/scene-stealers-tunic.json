This +2 resilient raiment padded armor was custom designed for Alessandro Domenesso, an actor as well known for their astounding costume changes as for their roguish off-stage activities. Even without utilizing the magic of this armor, it's elegant enough that it could easily be mistaken as fine clothing.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Look At Me!</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate, illusion, mental, visual)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You make yourself visible and apparent to a creature you can see that's within 30 feet.
