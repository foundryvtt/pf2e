The activating creature must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:20] save or be overcome with embarrassment for 1 hour, taking a â€“1 status penalty to Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance checks. During this time, if the creature attempts to speak or perform in front of an audience, they become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1}. When they recover from this sickened condition, the missive's effects end. You choose when composing the missive whether it remains as a non-magical document or burns to ash after imparting its magic.</p>"
