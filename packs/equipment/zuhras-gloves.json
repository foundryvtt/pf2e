They channel their magic through the gloves to assist you with their choice of offense or defense (as determined by the GM). The zuhra makes any choices for the spell, and any save DC is 30.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Offense</strong> The metal of the gloves wraps around your weapon and channels the zuhra's magic to cast a 6th-rank <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Weapon Storm]</em> spell, replicating the metal weapon.</li>\n<li><strong>Defense</strong> The metal flows off your arms, creating a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wall of Metal]</em>. The wall's surface has the same pattern as the gloves. You lose the gloves' item bonus until the barrier ends, at which point the metal returns to your hands and forearms. You can Dismiss the activation.</li>\n</ul>"
