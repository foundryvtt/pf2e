            "value": "<p>This device is made from two metal discs, one slightly smaller than the other, each bearing a variety of runes and symbols along their outer edges. The center ring typically shows a rune for each elemental plane, and many older ciphers include only the planes of air, earth, fire, and water. A thick, golden pin in the center of both discs holds them together.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate - Align to Plane <span class=\"action-glyph\">a</span> (manipulate, scrying, visual)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You turn the discs to align symbols, creating a minute planar gateway as large as a keyhole. You can look through it to view a location in an elemental plane. Each cipher connects to 12 locations on each elemental plane-typically large settlements. Anyone holding the cipher can understand the primary language of the plane the cipher is aligned to. A cipher of the planes can be used in place of a planar key for @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Interplanar Teleport] and similar magic for travel to the plane it's aligned to. When it's used this way, you arrive unerringly at the location the cipher is aligned to.</p>"
