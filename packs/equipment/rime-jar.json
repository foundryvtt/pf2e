Ilverani wizards create rime jars to sustain themselves during the coldest winter nights.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The jar draws off the cold and warms your body. If you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fatigued] condition caused by exposure to environmental cold, it removes the condition. For 8 hours after applying the rime, you treat extreme cold as severe cold.</p>"
