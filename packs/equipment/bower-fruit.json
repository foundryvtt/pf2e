She uses these cursed fruits to keep mortals in her thrall, but it's unknown whether she created them or simply popularized their use.</p>\n<p>A bower fruit condemns a non-fey who tastes it to never again be satisfied with Material Plane fare. Any fruit can be cursed in this manner, but stone fruits such as peaches, plums, mangoes, and lychees are most common. Upon activating a bower fruit by eating it, the fruit casts a 6th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Feast of Ashes] on you (@Check[type:fortitude|dc:30|traits:spell,curse]). This curse is permanent, but food from the First World, rather than no food, can sate your accursed hunger. If you sate your hunger this way, you gain an addiction as if First World food and drink were a drug for you (@Check[type:fortitude|dc:30]).</p>"
