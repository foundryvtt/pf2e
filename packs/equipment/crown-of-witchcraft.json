You gain a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks, and if you're a witch, you gain a +2 item bonus to your patron skill.</p>\n<p>If you have a familiar, you can attach a small portion of the crown's material to your familiar, such as a strip of fabric from a hat tied around its tail or a sprig of natural material linked to its collar; the familiar doesn't need to invest the item itself. If you do this, your familiar gains the tough pet ability as long as the crown is invested by you.</p>\n<p><strong>Activateâ€”Defiant Hex</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">F</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Gain 1 Focus Point, which you can spend only to cast a witch hex spell.
