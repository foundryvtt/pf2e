Only a handful of mortals can truthfully claim to have seen a toshigami, let alone met one, though many popular fireside tales tell of virtuous souls receiving a toshigami's blessing to fight for a worthy cause. Such stories have a basis in fact; every so often, a toshigami gives a worthy mortal a flower from their ward, time-locked in perfect bloom and granted sapience. Such <em>toshigami blossoms</em> are more sociable than their creators. Like toshigami, a blossom has a strong curiosity about the mortal world. If you wear a <em>toshigami blossom</em>, it can intercede for you, helping you make a good impression.</p>\n<p>A <em>toshigami blossom</em> has the following activations.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> command, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The blossom casts @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Nature's Pathway] on you to your specifications.

You and your allies can see through these blossoms. To all other creatures, creatures within the cloud of blossoms become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed], and creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it. When you or an ally succeeds with a Strike against a creature in the blossoms, the Strike deals an additional @Damage[1d6[mental]] and an additional @Damage[1d6[void]] to living creatures, or an additional @Damage[1d6[vitality]] to undead.</p>"
