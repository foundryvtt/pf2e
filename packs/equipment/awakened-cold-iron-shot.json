The awakened cold iron attempts to disrupt enchantments the target placed on others' minds. You can name a creature you believe to be enchanted by your target or allow the shot to choose an enchanted creature randomly. On a hit, the shot attempts to counteract the enchantment the target is using to manipulate that creature's mind. The counteract level is 9, and the counteract modifier is [[/r 1d20+27 #Counteract]]{+27}. If you fail (but don't critically fail) the counteract check against a demon or fey, you get a success instead. If you hit a demon or fey with no active enchantment effects on other creatures, the target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 minute instead.</p>"
