The contents of this library update automatically and constantly change, so as to always be relevant for whatever mystery or topic of research you're looking into. You can spend 4 hours in the library to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Gather Information] about any topic, and can use an appropriate Lore skill check instead of Diplomacy to determine success. In addition, folios and tomes in the library contain all the information one needs to learn the rituals for @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Call Spirit] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Collective Memories]. Performing either of these rituals in the research library grants a +2 item bonus to skill checks made to cast the ritual. This increases to a +3 bonus if you are at least 17th level.</p>",
