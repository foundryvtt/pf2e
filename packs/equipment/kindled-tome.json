It encourages you to learn new fire spells to inscribe within its pages. When you attempt a skill check to Learn a Spell to add a spell with the fire trait to the kindled tome, you treat your result as one step better than you rolled. The tome can be disparaging about other spells as \"a waste of good page space,\" especially if those spells have the cold or water traits.
