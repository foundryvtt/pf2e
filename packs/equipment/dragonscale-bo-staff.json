When benefiting from the circumstance bonus to AC granted by the bo staff's parry trait, you also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against magical effects of the tradition matching the dragon who provided the scales, plus resistance 5 to a damage type determined by that tradition: force for arcane, spirit for divine, mental for occult, or fire for primal. For instance, a <em>dragonscale bo staff</em> made with scales taken from an omen dragon would provide a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against occult effects and resistance 5 to mental damage.</p><hr /><p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> The initial raw materials must include scales from one type of dragon.</p>"
