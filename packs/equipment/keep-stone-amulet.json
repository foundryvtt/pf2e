            "value": "<p>The superior adamantine-lead alloy known as keep stone is as highly prized as it is expensive, and for good reason: keep stone combines the Hardness and durability of the finest metal with inherent magical protection. Not only does the metal itself resist magical effects, but anyone in proximity to a large amount of it also enjoys a degree of protection from divination magic. Dwarven crafters have attempted to make this extra protection more portable and more affordable in the form of <em>keep stone amulets</em>. Each amulet is unique in its exact shape, size, thickness, and decorations, but typically, a keep stone amulet is roughly palm-sized and engraved with clan symbols, holy aphorisms, or a favorite line of poetry.</p>\n<p>While wearing a <em>keep stone amulet</em>, if you're the target of a spell with the detection or scrying trait, the caster must succeed at a @Check[flat|dc:5|showDC:all] or lose the spell.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activateâ€”Rebuff Magic</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> (concentrate, misfortune)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You're the target of a spell with a spell attack roll</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> The caster must roll the spell attack roll twice and take the worse result.</p>"
