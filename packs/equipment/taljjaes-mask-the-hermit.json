Each of Taljjae's masks is an 18th-level unique item with the invested and magical traits; if broken, they're automatically repaired to full HP when invested during daily preparations. The effect of a mask on a PC is noted in the mask's Understudy entry. Wearing one of Taljjae's masks also imposes Taljjae's jelly sense and jelly gluttony on the creature as long as it wears the mask.</p>\n<p>The <em>Hermit</em> allows its wearer to cast 8th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Spirit Blast] and 7th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Flame Strike], each as a divine innate spell, once per day.</p>"
