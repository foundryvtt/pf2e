Using the purse, you can always sell items for their normal sell value during downtime, even if you aren't anywhere near a settlement. You just put them into the purse, and within a day, the proper sale price appears in coins and gems. Once per day, from any distance, the entity that holds your <em>bargained contract</em> automatically sells a common consumable item in your possession, giving you back only half the normal amount for a sold item.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> envision, command</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You deposit up to 30 gp of gems and coins in a separate pouch of the <em>bottomless purse</em> while thinking of a common consumable item costing that amount of money. You then upend the pouch. The item you envisioned comes tumbling out into your hand.</p>"
