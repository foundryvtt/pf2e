            "value": "<p>When the mighty fire-and-metal elemental <em>Temperbrand</em> is defeated, their corpse transforms into a <em>+3 major striking greater flaming grievous shifting maul</em> made of what appears to be molten steel, though it behaves as if it were made of solid metal. When a creature first picks up <em>Temperbrand</em>, they must succeed at a @Check[will|dc:43] save to establish their dominance over the weapon. On a success, they become <em>Temperbrand's</em> only accepted wielder and may use the weapon normally. On a failure, the character takes @Damage[20d6[fire]] damage (@Damage[40d6[fire]] damage on a critical failure) and drops the weapon as it melts away into slag and immediately reforms in an adjacent space. A new attempt to establish dominance can be made by picking the weapon up again and attempting a new Will save. Once <em>Temperbrand</em> has an accepted wielder, it can't be wielded by anyone else unless the accepted wielder intentionally permits it, declaring so in a loud voice; this permission can be rescinded in a similar manner. Anyone else trying to wield <em>Temperbrand</em> after it has accepted a wielder takes fire damage and causes the weapon to melt away as if they failed the Will save to wield it.</p>\n<p>The additional fire damage caused by <em>Temperbrand's</em> greater flaming property (but not its persistent fire damage) is splash damage. <em>Temperbrand's</em> wielder is immune to this splash damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Molten Smash</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (concentrate, manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You smash <em>Temperbrand</em> against the ground or another solid adjacent surface, causing an explosion of molten metal and force to radiate outward in a @Template[emanation|distance:20]. All creatures in this area take @Damage[10d6[fire]] damage and @Damage[6d6[force]] damage (@Check[reflex|dc:43|basic] save); those who critically fail this save are knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone]. You are immune to the effects of Molten Smash, but your allies are not.</p>"
