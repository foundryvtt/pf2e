A @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wall of Thorns] empowered with this catalyst gains the fungus trait and appears diseased and toxic, with greasy filaments of dripping fungus growing through its vines. A creature damaged by this wall's thorns takes an additional @Damage[3d6[persistent,poison]].</p>"
