You immediately gain the ability to speak and understand the language the target creature is currently speaking, or its native language if it's not currently talking, for 24 hours. During this time, you can Interact with the spectacles of discernment to flip down a pair of supplementary lenses. When you do so, if you're observing the creature you originally targeted, roll a secret counteract check with a counteract modifier of [[/r 1d20+23 #Counteract]]{+23} against any illusion, morph, or polymorph effect affecting the target, but only for the purpose of determining whether you see through the disguise or not.</p>"
