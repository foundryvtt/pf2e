As an envision action, you can cause the arm to become corporeal until the end of your turn, allowing it to make Strikes or grasp objects. It remains corporeal if you're holding an item or it's wearing an item at the end of your turn. Your unarmed attack Strikes made with the <em>aether appendage</em> become magical. If they're already magical, they instead gain the effect of the ghost touch property rune.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> envision, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're holding a non-magical item of light or negligible Bulk</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The item becomes incorporeal for 1 minute.
