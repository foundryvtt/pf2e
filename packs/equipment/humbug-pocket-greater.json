The pocket grants you a +3 item bonus to Society and to Stealth checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Conceal an Object] in the pocket.</p>\n<p>The pocket can produce stationery and writing implements of high quality. When you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Create Forgery]{Create a Forgery}, you can use the pocket to produce ideal materials to make the forgery. Any materials must be able to fit through the opening of the pocket, such as a roll of parchment, an inkwell, or a loupe. Though they're excellent tools, they don't have any value if sold and disappear once their function in making a forgery is fulfilled.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate—Papers Please</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (concentrate, manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You create up to 5 temporary forgeries by imagining the documents you need and pulling them from the pocket.
