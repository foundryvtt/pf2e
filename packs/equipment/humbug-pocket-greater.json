The pocket can hold no more than one item of light Bulk, plus incidental items of negligible Bulk. The pocket grants you a +3 item bonus to Society and to Stealth checks to Conceal an Object in the pocket.</p>\n<p>The pocket can produce stationery and writing implements of high quality. When you Create a Forgery, you can use the pocket to produce ideal materials to make the forgery. Any materials must be able to fit through the opening of the pocket, such as a roll of parchment, an inkwell, or a loupe. Though they're excellent tools, they don't have any value if sold and disappear once their function in making a forgery is fulfilled.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Papers Please</strong><span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (concentrate, manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Frequency</strong></strong> once per hour</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><strong>Effect</strong></strong> You create up to 5 temporary forgery by imagining the document you need and pulling it from the pocket. Attempt to Create a Forgery of the document you desire, with the GM rolling the secret check as normal. Its quality is based on your check, but the document disintegrates after 1 hour.</p>\n<p>All 5 forgeries must serve a similar purpose—five invitations to the same party for different attendees, for example. Attempt only one check for all the documents.</p>"
