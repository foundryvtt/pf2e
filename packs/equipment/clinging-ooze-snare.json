With its ingenious mixture of rare reagents, dried protoplasm harvested from ooze creatures, and a little pinch of alchemy, this snare triggers into an ooze-like hazard that temporarily mimics the dangers presented by a creature like a sewer ooze or other carnivorous protoplasmic monster.</p>\n<p>When a creature triggers a clinging ooze snare, the snare creates a short lived protoplasmic mass that lashes out in all directions, dealing @Damage[2d6[bludgeoning],2d6[acid]]{2d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 acid damage}. The triggering creature must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:21|traits:damaging-effect] save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half damage</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target takes full damage and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] until the start of their next turn as the ooze impedes their movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target takes double damage and is both off-guard and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] for 1 round. The target can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] (DC 21) to end this effect early.</p>"
