The crafter chooses aberration, animal, beast, celestial, construct, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, giant, monitor, ooze, or both fungus and plant. The weapon deals 1d6 additional damage of the weapon's damage type to creatures with the chosen trait or traits. The benefit doesn't apply against creatures of the chosen type disguised as other creatures. It's up to GM discretion whether the bane rune applies against a creature disguised as a creature of the chosen type.</p>\n<p>The GM might allow bane runes for other creature traits, such as astral, dream, or demon. However, humanoids, undead, and specific types of humanoids (such as elves) are never a valid option.</p>"
