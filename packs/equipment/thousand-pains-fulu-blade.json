A creature to which the fulu is affixed must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:23|basic:true]. Failure or critical failure primes the target for persistent damage triggered by a specific condition that must be met within the fulu's duration.</p>\n<p>This red fulu feels rigid, its edges sharp, and looking at it makes you feel feverish. The fulu deals @Damage[5d6[slashing]] as meridians burst and cut through flesh. On a failure or critical failure, if the target fails to take an action with the manipulate or move trait on each of its turns, it takes @Damage[1d6[persistent,slashing]].</p>"
