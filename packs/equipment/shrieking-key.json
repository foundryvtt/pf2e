            "value": "<p>A skull-topped metal <em>shrieking key</em> appears to be a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Skeleton Key]</em>, useful in place of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Thieves' Toolkit]{Thieves' Tools}</em> when attempting to Pick a Lock. A <em>shrieking key</em> has no activation, however. When you use it to Pick a Lock, the key emits a loud shriek audible for 500 feet despite ambient noise. Physical barriers still block or muffle the shriek as normal. You also take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to the Thievery check rather than enjoying a bonus. After you attempt such a check with the key the first time, it fuses to you, returning to your possession if discarded. To use another device to Pick a Lock, you must first succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:20] save.</p>"
