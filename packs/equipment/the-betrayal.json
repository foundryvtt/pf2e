Once, a PC can spend 8 hours of downtime here to study these choices and grow envious of how their lives might have been different, if not outright better, had they made different choices in their past. The next time the PC retrains a feat, skill, or class feature, it takes half as long as it otherwise would to retrain. A PC can benefit from this room only once per level.</p>",
