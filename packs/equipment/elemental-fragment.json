You crack the fragment as you activate it, unleashing the planar energy within. This energy casts a spell of your choice: a 5th-rank <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Elemental Form]</em> spell affecting you or a 5th-rank <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Summon Elemental]</em> spell; if you summon an elemental, you can Sustain the activation to keep control of the elemental. The spell's element matches that of the fragment.</p>"
