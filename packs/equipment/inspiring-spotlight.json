If the line passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, the <em>inspiring spotlight</em> attempts to counteract the darkness.</p>\n<p>Creatures within the line gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, creatures in the line who are frightened reduce the value of their frightened condition by 1 at the beginning of each turn they start in the area of the line.</p>\n<p>The beam remains in place for 1 minute or until you push the right-hand button with another Interact action to extinguish the light.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Inspiring Spotlight]</p>"
