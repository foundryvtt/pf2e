When delivered, the poison acts quickly to constrict the victim's blood flow to their extremities and turn their lungs into a soft jelly. A victim of astringent venom is recognizable by the frostbite-like hue of their hands as they loose circulation to their extremities, making it difficult for them to hold things. Each round at the beginning of their turn, a creature affected by astringent venom must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] or drop one random item they're holding.</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> @Check[type:fortitude|dc:32]</p>\n<p><strong>Onset</strong> 1 round</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Duration</strong> 6 rounds</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> @Damage[6d6[poison]] (1 round)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> @Damage[8d6[poison]] (1 round)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong> @Damage[10d6[poison]] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Confused] (1 round)</p>"
