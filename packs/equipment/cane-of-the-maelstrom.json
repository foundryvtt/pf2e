If you successfully Strike a creature, the cane also affects the target with a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.rollable-tables.RollTable.Warpwaves]{Warpwave}.</p>\n<p>While you carry the cane, you hear a constant, distracting chorus of laughing, incoherent Protean whispers and sing-song voices in your mind. Blatant acts of self-indulgence or narcissism quell these whispers, from a few minutes up to a full day depending on the scope of the act, but they immediately return when you use the artifact's powers. The gradually rising chorus eventually drives away rational thought and renders the cane's owner insane, even if staved off from time to time with self-centered acts.</p>\n<p>As the artifact's abilities pull material from the Maelstrom, it doesn't function in areas where planar connections are severed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You are targeted by a ranged attack from an opponent you can see</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You draw a temporary shield of chaotic turbulence with a cerulean flash.
