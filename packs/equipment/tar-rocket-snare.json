The triggering creature must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:20|traits:uncommon|showDC:all] save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is dealt a glancing blow by the rocket and becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The rocket's coating of tar and resin sticks to the creature, and it can't be shaken loose. The creature becomes off-guard for 1 round, and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1} for 1 minute or until it Escapes (DC 20).</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature takes a direct hit. It takes @Damage[2d6[bludgeoning]] damage and is pushed 10 feet in the direction the rocket faces.</p>"
