If the vessel the figurehead is attached to has the sluggish vehicle ability, the figurehead suppresses that ability. Captains frequently give the ability to activate an <em>aboutface figurehead</em> to the person at the helm of their ship.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate—About Face!</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> (concentrate, move)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The figurehead turns its head as if to look behind it, spawning a momentary whirlpool under the ship and turbulent winds directly opposite the ship's heading. The ship makes a 180-degree turn in place, then continues heading in this new direction starting next turn.</p>"
