A <em>merciful</em> weapon has the nonlethal trait and can't be used to make a lethal attack. Any persistent damage the weapon would deal is negated.</p>\n<p>On a critical hit, a merciful weapon causes the target to become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fascinated] with the weapon's wielder for 1 minute, as the target is bombarded with feelings of guilt and remorse. This is a mental effect. If you have access to the weapon's critical specialization effect, you choose whether to use it or the <em>merciful</em> effect.</p>"
