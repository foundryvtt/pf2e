Applying <em>anointing oil</em> to a corpse casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Peaceful Rest]</em> on it. The effects last for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>The oil is repugnant to the undead. An undead creature that touches a corpse treated with this oil is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} until the contact is broken or the oil's effect wears off.</p>"
