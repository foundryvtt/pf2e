When light from the lantern passes through the lens, it alters the light to make it easier to perform a common exploration activity with the lantern.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, an <em>exploration lens</em> can be installed in a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder] like an aeon stone. In this case, light (such as that from a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Lantern (Hooded)], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Torch], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Light] spell) must still pass through the lens and you must hold the wayfinder in your hand for it to function.</p>\n<p>There are several different types of <em>exploration lens</em>, each granting benefits with a different type of exploration activity. Each type of lens is distinguishable from all the other types by holding it up to a bright light.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Type: Investigating</strong></p>\n<p>The outer rim of this lens glows faintly when held up to the light.</p>\n<p>While activated, the lens grants you a +1 item bonus to skill checks to Recall Knowledge while @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Investigate]{Investigating} by outlining potential clues in a way that triggers your memory.</p>\n<p>If you're Investigating something while using the lens, you can always roll a Recall Knowledge skill check appropriate to the investigation for initiative.</p>"
