You crack the fragment as you activate it, unleashing the planar energy within. This energy casts a spell of your choice: a 7th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Elemental Form] spell affecting you or a 7th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Summon Elemental] spell; if you summon an elemental, you can Sustain the activation to keep control of the elemental. The spell's element matches that of the fragment.</p>"
