One side of the beads is white, and the other is a dark, stormy gray. Once flipped, a bead stays on its newly exposed side for an entire day before resetting overnight.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Healing Wind</strong><span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day per bead</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You open your fan and turn a bead of your choice. The fan casts a 3-action @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Heal] spell with an area of a @Template[type:cone|distance:30] instead of a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]; the save DC for an undead creature is 28. This spell gains the air trait. The rank of the spell depends on which bead you're turning: the first two beads cast 4th-rank <em>heal</em>, the center two cast 3rd-rank <em>heal</em>, and the last two cast 2nd-rank <em>heal</em>.</p>"
