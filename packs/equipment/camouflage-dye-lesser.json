When you Activate the dye by sprinkling it on yourself or a creature within reach, the target and its clothing change colors, blending into their surroundings until the target makes a sudden movement. The target can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Hide] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sneak] without cover or concealment for 10 minutes. If the target uses a hostile action or moves at more than half its Speed, after that action is completed, the effects of camouflage powder end and the creature ceases to be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] or undetected.</p>"
