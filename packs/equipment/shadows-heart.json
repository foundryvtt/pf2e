If the attack hits, you also leave behind a shadowy, illusory duplicate of yourself that attacks the same target for up to 3 rounds. The illusion has 1 action per round, which it takes on the turn it's created and on your turn each round. It uses this action to move up to 30 feet to a square adjacent to the target and (if the target is adjacent) to attack the target with a [[/r 1d20+28 #Attack Roll]]{+28} attack modifier, dealing @Damage[(3d6+16)[slashing]] damage. The illusion has an AC of 35 and is immediately destroyed by any attack that deals damage or requires a saving throw.</p>"
