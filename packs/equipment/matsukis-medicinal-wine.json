In addition to making you tipsy, this medicinal wine works wonders in helping to recover from diseaseâ€”including (ironically) drug addiction. Matsuki's medicinal wine functions as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Alcohol], except that its saving throw is a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:18] save. In addition, upon drinking a dose of Matsuki's medicinal wine, you gain a +2 item bonus to Fortitude saving throws against diseases and poisons for 24 hours. This applies to your daily save against a disease's progression; however, the bonus doesn't apply to any checks you attempt against Matsuki's medical wine itself.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Matsuki's Medicinal Wine]</p>"
