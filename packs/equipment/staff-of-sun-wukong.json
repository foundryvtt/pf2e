When not in use, the Staff of Sun Wukong shrinks to the size and weight of a needle or toothpick, making it highly concealable (+4 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks to hide it from sight). In this form, the item has negligible Bulk. You can Activate this ability again to return the staff to its normal size.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Cloud Somersault</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (manipulate)</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You use the shapeshifting capabilities of this relic to propel yourself great distances.

Magical fire similarly has no effect on this relic. The only way to destroy this item is to expose it to the intense heat of a specific volcano in the depths of the Songil Sea (though which volcano remains shrouded in myth).</p>"
