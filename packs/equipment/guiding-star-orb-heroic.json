            "gm": "<p>The <em>Guiding Star Orb</em> is focused on Kyonin's safety and protection. It imparts the following edicts and anathema on the wielder. If they're violated, the artifact reverts to its non-artifact form until the wielder atones, either through the use of the atone ritual, or through a short side quest or influence encounter of your own design.</p><p><strong>Edicts</strong> kill Treerazer, protect elven lives, push back Tanglebriar's boundaries</p><p><strong>Anathema</strong> aid Treerazer, willingly betray Kyonin</p><h2>Choose Apex Attribute</h2><p>The <em>Guiding Star Orb</em> is a powerful apex item, but the apex bonuses granted are more powerful than most. As with all apex items, a PC can only benefit from one apex item at a time. When your character creates the artifact, choose one attribute modifier. When you invest the artifact, you either increase that attribute modifier by 2 or increase it to +5, whichever would give you a higher value. Once you make this selection, you can't change it later.</p><hr /><p><em>Note: Select the apex attribute on the details tab of this item.</em></p><h2>Choose Heroic Skill</h2><p>The <em>Guiding Star Orb</em> also bolsters one skill of your choice. When your character creates the artifact, choose one of the three skills listed for the artifact. As long as the artifact is invested by you, it grants you a +4 item bonus to checks with that skill.</p><h2>Heroic Recovery</h2><p>Finally, the <em>Guiding Star Orb</em> has 1 Recovery Point; this point replenishes once per day when its invested partner does their daily preparations. When the artifact's partner's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dying] value would reach an amount sufficient to kill them (usually 4), the artifact spends its Recovery Point, and the partner instead increases their @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed] value by 1 and stabilizes at 0 Hit Points.</p>",

As long as you have him invested, the <em>Guiding Star Orb</em> orbits your body instead of needing to be held in one hand. You can stow the <em>Guiding Star Orb</em> with an Interact action, and he can be snatched out of the air with a successful @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Disarm] action against you. When stowed, the <em>Guiding Star Orb</em> remains invested, but if he's removed from you via Disarm, your investment ends if you don't reclaim him by the end of your next turn. The <em>Guiding Star Orb's</em> voice is scholarly and precise, speaking telepathically with clearly enunciated but often complex words, and he assumes you're educated enough to keep up with his academic dialogue.</p>\n<p>As long as you have the <em>Guiding Star Orb</em> invested, teleportation effects created by you or the <em>Guiding Star Orb</em> aren't affected by the Witchbole's meddling with teleportation effects, and they can't be counteracted by the Witchbole.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Blinding Spark</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate, incapacitation, light, visual)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>Guiding Star Orb</em> creates a beam of bright light and fires it at a creature within 30 feet. That creature must attempt a @Check[fortitude|dc:43] save, after which that creature is temporarily immune to Blinding Spark for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Blinded] for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target is permanently blinded.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Embed Location</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> By focusing, the <em>Guiding Star Orb</em> embeds your current location within. Thereafter, anyone who touches the <em>Guiding Star Orb</em> while casting a spell with the teleportation trait to travel to this location arrives precisely, without any inaccuracy at all. The <em>Guiding Star Orb</em> can have up to three locations embedded at a time; if this activity is used a fourth time, the new location replaces the oldest stored one.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Momentary Aiudara</strong> 10 minutes (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> A shimmering magical archway appears next to you as the <em>Guiding Star Orb</em> casts a 9th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Teleport] to your specifications. If you're teleporting to an aiudara you've visited before, you and the targets appear precisely at that location. If you're teleporting to Lotusgate in Kyonin, this effect functions as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Interplanar Teleport] if you aren't on the same plane as Kyonin.</p>"
