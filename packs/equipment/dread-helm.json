The mist grants an item bonus to Intimidation checks equal to the dread ampoule's item bonus. The mist also deals mental damage equal to the dread ampoule's splash damage to all creatures within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:5] other than you. The activation uses up the dread ampoule, and the helm can't be activated again until a new one is installed.</p>"
