Clever people can spin these clouds into small handfuls, creating a magical bundle of elemental power. Unlike most bottled breath, <em>spun clouds</em> don't have any effect on you while you hold them in your lungs, but you can exhale the cloud as a single action. When exhaled, the cloud flows out and expands into a @Template[type:burst|distance:20] within 60 feet of you. The cloud dissipates after 1 minute.</p>\n<p>A white cloud swirls with winds that speed up travel. A creature that starts its turn in the cloud gains a +10-foot item bonus to its land Speed and fly Speed (if it has one) until the end of its turn.</p>"
