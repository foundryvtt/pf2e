            "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> When you epitomize <em>The Owl</em>, assign it to a point of interest in the forest. This region becomes the home of an unusually large owl. A PC who travels to this region can spend 8 hours observing the owl and pondering the many worlds it has gazed upon by attempting a @Check[type:nature|dc:30] check. With a success, the owl hoots in delight, and the woodlands in the region shift and change to match those of a woodland or jungle that the PC is familiar with. From this point on, the PCs can use the Enter the Harrow Court activity here to open a one-way portal to that forest or jungle, arriving at a location of import or particular familiarity within the region as determined by the GM. Switching to a new woodland requires another @Check[type:nature|dc:30] check and familiarity with that region. A PC who Enters the Harrow Court can now choose to arrive in the demiplane at this point of interest rather than in Harrowheart's great hall.</p>",
