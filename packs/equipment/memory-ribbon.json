Magical versions also exist that help enhance the wearer's memory. These magical ribbons are especially popular when someone has been invited to serve as a toastmaster at a guild banquet or as a master of ceremonies at an important festival. Their use in final oral exams for high positions is, however, hotly debated.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Read the Ribbon's Story</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">f</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You attempt a skill check to Recall Knowledge but haven't rolled yet</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> The memory ribbon grants you a +2 item bonus to the triggering skill check to Recall Knowledge.
