It can compel truth, but it carries a fatal price if the victim can't stop themself from repeatedly telling lies. While under the effect of fraudslayer oil, the victim takes the listed poison damage and mental damage for any time they voluntarily and knowingly tell a lie, due to the poison's increased blood pressure to their brain. They take this damage once per round at most, even if they lie several times in rapid succession. The victim is aware of this effect and can choose to not answer or give only evasive, technically truthful, answers.</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> @Check[fortitude|dc:34]</p>\n<p><strong>Onset</strong> 1 minute</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Duration</strong> 6 minutes</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1}, @Damage[3d6[poison]] damage and @Damage[3d6[mental]] damage for lying (1 minute)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 2}, @Damage[4d6[poison]] damage and @Damage[4d6[mental]] damage for lying (1 minute)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 3}, @Damage[5d6[poison]] damage and @Damage[5d6[mental]] damage for lying, and the damage becomes a death effect.
