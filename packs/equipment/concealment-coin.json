You can unscrew or close the coin with an Interact action. You can determine an unattended concealment coin's true nature with a successful @Check[type:perception|dc:20] check. Determining the coin's nature while it's being handled is more difficult and typically requires a successful Perception check against the Thievery DC of the person holding the coin.</p>"
