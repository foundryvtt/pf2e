For 1 hour after eating a pucker pickle, you smell slightly of pickle, but you have a horrendous taste. Once a creature hits you with a Strike using an attack that allows it to taste you, such as a jaws Strike, it takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to further attacks against you that allow it to taste you, including attacks like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Grapple]{Grappling} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Trip]{Tripping} you using its jaws or Swallowing you Whole. Creatures, especially animals, often choose other targets after tasting you. Any creature that Engulfs you or Swallows you Whole is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1}. If it spends an action retching to reduce the sickened condition, you can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] as a reaction.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Pucker Pickle]</p>"
