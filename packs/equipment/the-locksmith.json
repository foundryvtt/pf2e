This simulacrum is nameless, and the building they bring to the village is more akin to a strange museum of obscure and unusual locks and keys (none of which, of course, have any use beyond being strange displays). Their equipment can't be removed from the museum, but PCs who bring devices and locks to this building can take advantage of their tools to gain a +2 item bonus to checks made to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Disable Device] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Pick a Lock]. The locksmith knows the formulas for how to create chimes of opening, keymaking tools, rings of maniacal devices, skeleton keys, traveler's any-tools, and any other lock- or puzzle-themed magic item you might wish to include, and can teach these formulas to the PCs. Characters who use the locksmith's gear to craft such items gain a +2 item bonus on Crafting checks.</p>",
