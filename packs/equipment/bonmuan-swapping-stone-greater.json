When you activate the stone, you throw it into a space within 100 feet. The stone then casts @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Translocate]{Dimension Door} on you and transports you to itself. This destroys the stone.</p>\n<p>You can instead hurl the stone at a creature in an attempt to bring that creature closer to you. Make a ranged Strike against a creature using your highest proficiency with a ranged weapon. The <em>swapping stone</em> has a range increment of 15 feet. On a hit, the stone shatters against the creature, casting <em>dimension door</em> on the creature and causing it to instantly teleport to a space adjacent to you. An unwilling creature can resist this teleportation with a successful @Check[type:will|dc:37|traits:teleportation] save.</p>"
