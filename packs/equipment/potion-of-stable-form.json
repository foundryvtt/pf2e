When you drink this potion, it immediately attempts to counteract all hostile transmutation effects affecting you (counteract level 5, counteract check modifier +17). For the next hour, you gain a +2 item bonus against transmutation effects, which is +3 against polymorph effects. If you roll a success against a polymorph effect during that time, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Potion of Stable Form]</p>"
