            "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> A Medium anthropomorphic cricket simulacrum moves into a previously empty building at the edge of the village surrounding Harrowheart. The cricket spends most of their time playing their fiddle or eating fruit, but a PC can visit them to secure swift passage to another area within Harrow Court. Once per day, the cricket can transport any number of PCs, but only to one location in Harrow Court—the transportation happens in only a few seconds, regardless of the distance traveled. The cricket remains at that location until the next day, during which time they can transport the PCs back to the village. In addition, the cricket can teach powerful but uncommon travel spells, including @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Gate], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Interplanar Teleport], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Teleport], and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Nature's Pathway].</p>",
