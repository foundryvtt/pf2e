Activating a feather token causes it to transform into another object, which then can be used as normal for that object. Each feather can be activated only once, with most of them permanently becoming the item in their description.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">A</span> Interact</p>\n<p>This token can be activated only on an unoccupied patch of earth or soil. When activated, this token transforms into an oak tree, 60 feet tall with a 5-foot-wide trunk. The tree continues to live and grow if conditions are favorable.</p>"
