You learn and memorize one random fact about a specific type of Lore (such as Architecture Lore, Elf Lore, Astral Plane Lore) that you didn't previously know, chosen by the GM. The next time you attempt a check to Recall Knowledge on this type of Lore within the next year, you gain a +1 status bonus on the check. You can benefit from only one <em>echo token</em> at a time in this way; if you Flip another <em>echo token</em>, the Lore skill changes. However, the memorized fact will remain perfectly in your memory forever unless magically altered or removed.</p>"
