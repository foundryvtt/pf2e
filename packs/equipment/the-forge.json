These raw materials can be used to create items or even simply harvested and sold for a profit, as they do not vanish if taken out of the Harrow Court. Once these raw materials are used or sold, they do not replenish.</p>\n<p>However, additional materials do manifest periodically within the workshop. Their appearances are linked to the party's level, manifesting as soon as The Forge is epitomized or (if The Forge is already epitomized) as soon as the PCs attain the respective level.</p>\n<p><strong>17th-level:</strong> 13,500 gp of cold iron</p>\n<p><strong>18th-level:</strong> 18,000 gp of dawnsilver</p>\n<p><strong>19th-level:</strong> 18,000 gp of adamantine</p>\n<p><strong>20th-level:</strong> 30,000 gp of orichalcum</p>",
