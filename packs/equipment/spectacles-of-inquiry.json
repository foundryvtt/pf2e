This benefit lasts until you Activate the item again in this way. If you're an investigator, you can use this activation as part of the action you take to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Devise a Stratagem] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Pursue a Lead], and you can do the latter even though you can't see the creature. You must choose the same creature you chose for Devise a Stratagem or Pursue a Lead.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> You are an investigator.</p>"
