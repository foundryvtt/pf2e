Adding this catalyst to a suggestion spell implants a strange compulsion in one target of the spell. The target creature must spin counterclockwise at the end of its turn if it didn't take a move action that turn. This spin is a free action that has the move trait. This effect lasts for 3 rounds on a success, failure, or critical failure against @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Suggestion] (even if the target completes its <em>suggestion</em> in fewer rounds); a target that critically succeeds against <em>suggestion</em> is unaffected by the <em>swirling sand</em>.</p>"
