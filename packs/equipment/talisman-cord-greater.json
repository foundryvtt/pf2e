The cord is attuned to three particular schools of magic, chosen when the cord was created. It gains the corresponding trait for that school. When you activate a talisman threaded through a cord with the same magic school trait that's also the cord's level or lower, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:16]. On a success, that talisman is not consumed and can be used again.</p>"
