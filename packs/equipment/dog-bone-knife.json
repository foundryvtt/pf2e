A werecreature or other creature willingly under the effects of a non-permanent polymorph effect damaged by a <em>dog-bone knife</em> must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:19] save or immediately revert to its natural form-this has no effect on a creature unwillingly polymorphed. On a successful save, the creature is temporarily immune to this effect for 1 minute. Kushtakas and other creatures vulnerable to canines take a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against this effect, and this weapon overcomes any resistance such creatures have to physical attacks.</p>"
