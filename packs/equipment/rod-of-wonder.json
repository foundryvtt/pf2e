If an entry lists only a spell name, the rod casts that spell at its lowest level. You make any decisions for a spell cast by the rod unless otherwise indicated, except that it must target the creature you chose, or the creature you chose must be the center of the spell's area, if it has an area but no targets. If the spell's range is less than 60 feet, increase the range to 60 feet.</p>\n<p>Any spell DC required is DC 27, and any spell attack roll required is [[/r 1d20+17]]. If the rod casts a spell on you, you don't get a saving throw or other defense against it.</p>\n<p>Once activated, the rod can't be activated again for [[/r 1d4]] hours.</p>\n<p>Roll on the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.rollable-tables.RollTable.Rod of Wonder] table to determine the outcome.</p>"
