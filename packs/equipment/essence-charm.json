The essence charm grants a +1 item bonus to that skill when worn.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Lucky Charm</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You fail or critically fail a check using the essence charm's chosen skill</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> A failed check becomes a success, and a critical failure becomes a failure.</p>"
