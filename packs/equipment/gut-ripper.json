Rip Guts!</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> <strong>Cost</strong> 1 Mythic Point</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You throw <em>Gut-Ripper</em> in a line of any length up to 60 feet, then it returns to your hands. Each creature in the line takes @Damage[2d10[piercing]|options:area-damage] damage with a @Check[fortitude|dc:25|basic|options:area-effect] save. If there's a creature at the end of the line, you instead make a melee Strike against it with the hook that deals an additional @Damage[2d10[persistent,bleed]] damage. Each time a creature takes this bleed damage, you regain that many HP; this is a healing vitality effect. This activation can't be used again for [[/gmr 1d4 #Recharge Rip Guts! Rip Guts!]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>"
