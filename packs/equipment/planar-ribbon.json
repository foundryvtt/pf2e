This activation has the scrying trait.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You extend the ribbon to brush against a foe up to 60 feet away. If that creature fails a @Check[type:reflex|dc:42] save, you exchange positions with the target and all of that creature's allies are flat-footed to you until the end of your turn. This activation has the teleportation trait.</p>"
