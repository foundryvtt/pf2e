You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target's AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet. The spellgun fires a shadowy ray, then dissolves into gray mist.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target takes @Damage[4d6[void]] and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 2} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed]{Doomed 1}. If it had fewer than half its maximum Hit Points after taking the void damage, it's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 3} instead. If the Hit Point loss from being drained drops the creature to 0 Hit Points, it dies.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but for the drained condition, the target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 1}, or drained 2 if it had fewer than half its maximum HP.</p>"
