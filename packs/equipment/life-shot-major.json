A creature hit by activated life shot takes no damage from the successful attack, instead receiving [[/r (8d4+11)[healing]]]{8d4+11 healing} and gaining a +3 item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 1 minute. On a critical hit, roll the healing received twice and take the better result (this is a fortune effect). A target willing to be hit by this attack is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] against it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Elixir of Life (Major)]</p>"
