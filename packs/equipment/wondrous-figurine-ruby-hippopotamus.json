When activated, it transforms into an enraged @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-2.Actor.Hippopotamus] that sees everything within 30 feet of its activation area as its territory. It will relentlessly and ferociously attack anyone within this area except you, but it ignores your commands in favor of defending its area. The hippopotamus is active for 1 minute before reverting to its statue shape, satisfied that it has punished all possible interlopers into its territory. The figurine can be used only once per day.</p>"
