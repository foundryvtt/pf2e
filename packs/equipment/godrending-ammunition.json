When an activated godrending ammunition hits a target, the body of the struck creature attempts to tear itself apart, causing nauseating pain. Instead of its normal damage, the ammunition deals @Damage[10d8[slashing]] damage. The target can attempt a @Check[fortitude|dc:30] saving throw; it takes a –2 circumstance penalty to this save if the Strike was a critical hit.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The foe takes the normal damage from the ammunition, instead of the 10d8 slashing damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The foe takes half damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The foe takes full damage and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1}.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The foe takes double damage and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 2}. A creature reduced to 0 HP from this damage is ripped limb from limb, and it instantly dies; its gear remains.</p>"
