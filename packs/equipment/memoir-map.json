Each time you journey somewhere new or accomplish something noteworthy to you, a design or symbol appears, representing the event. The positions of these images are relative in location, but measurements aren't exact. A memoir map starts with an icon representing your location when you receive the tattoo, usually over the heart, and grows from there. Traveling to another plane causes a new portion to appear on a different part of your body to represent that plane. If you want a record of your life before you receive your memoir map, you can have the tattoo artist embellish the map to represent past events.</p>"
