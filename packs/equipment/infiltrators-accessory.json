While the blade is merged, it can't be drawn and gains the benefits of a 3rd-rank magic aura spell to appear non-magical. Passive observers can't attempt a check to notice the cane is anything more than a mundane, if superb, fashion accessory. Those carefully examining it can discern the cane is more than it appears, but doing so is extremely difficult (@Check[type:perception|dc:30|traits:action:seek]). Activating the sword cane again releases the blade, allowing it to be drawn normally.</p>"
