The first creature to enter the square must succeed at a @Check[type:reflex|dc:15] save or be doused with the substances. For 1 hour, animals attracted to the flavor (such as most predators, at the GM's discretion) can smell the creature from double the usual distance of their scent and are likely to approach to investigate the smell. A creature can wash away the appetizing flavor with 1 minute of vigorous scrubbing.</p>"
