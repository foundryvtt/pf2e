The sides of the cloak are slightly weighted, making it easy to grab ahold of when it fills with air. This cloak grants you a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Leap] and a +1 item bonus to Acrobatics checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Balance] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Maneuver in Flight].</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activateâ€”Fall Gently</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">R</span> (concentrate, air)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You're falling</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The cloak catches the air and you grab onto its edges, utilizing the draft to guide you to safety. Treat your fall as 30 feet shorter and glide to a space of your choice at the bottom of your fall, which must be within 20 feet of where you would've landed</p>"
