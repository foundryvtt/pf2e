A creature to which the fulu is affixed must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:27|basic:true]. Failure or critical failure primes the target for persistent damage triggered by a specific condition that must be met within the fulu's duration.</p>\n<p>Picking up this white fulu feels like you've stabbed your hand with a pin. The fulu deals @Damage[7d6[piercing]] as hair, nails, and connective tissues stab inward. On a failure or critical failure, if the target then takes an action with the move trait, it takes @Damage[2d6[persistent,piercing]].</p>"
