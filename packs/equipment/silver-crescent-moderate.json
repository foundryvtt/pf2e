For 1 hour, you shed cool, white light like a torch, and you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against olfactory effects according to the crescent's type. While shedding this light, you can't be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] if you're visible, and if you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Invisible], you're concealed instead rather than being undetected.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Effect</strong> <span class=\"\\&quot;pf2-icon\\&quot; pf2-icon\">1</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> A ray of light descends on a 5-foot square of your choice within 120 feet. Any creature in that space takes [[/r 7d6[positive]]] with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:28|basic:true] and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] until the end of its next turn on a failed save. This is treated as silver for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like. The silver crescent becomes inert.</p>"
