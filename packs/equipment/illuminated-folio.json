These summoned creatures appear as living illustrations, granting them resistance to physical damage equal to half their level and weakness 5 to fire and to any ability with the water trait. They can also fold themselves up to pass through spaces only an inch or so wide as part of their movement.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Illuminated Folio]</p>"
