While sinister and prone to cruel comments, this rakshasa does not plot against the PCs and is content to idle away their time in their underground pleasure chambers. Once per day, a visitor to the rakshasa can pose them a question that they can use their Occultism [[/r 1d20+18 #Occultism]]{+18} skill to attempt to Recall Knowledge about. The rakshasa also knows several uncommon spells and rituals that they can teach spellcasters&mdash;these spells and rituals all involve the intrusive manipulation of sapient minds. Among the spells it can teach are <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Dominate]</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mind Probe]</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mind Reading]</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Rewrite Memory]</em>; rituals it can teach include <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Geas]</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Inveigle]</em>. Feel free to add similar spells to this list as you see fit.</p>",
