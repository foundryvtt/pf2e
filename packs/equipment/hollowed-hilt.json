Often used by knight emissaries to hide important missives, this space can hold an object of light Bulk about the size of a scroll. A creature studying the weapon can find the hilt compartment with a successful @Check[type:perception|dc:20] check. Any weapon with an appropriate hilt or pommel can be converted into a hollowed one by paying the equipment's price.</p>"
