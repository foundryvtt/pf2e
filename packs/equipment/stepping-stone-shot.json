When you fire an activated <em>stepping stone shot</em>, whether you hit or miss your target, the shot creates a series of supports in a line that creatures can walk on as if solid ground. The line can ascend or descend at a 45-degree angle. The discs support any amount of weight, but don't otherwise pose any sort of obstacle; creatures and attacks can move through them if they wish. They crumble to dust if anything attempts to move or otherwise manipulate them. A creature can use a two-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to Stride up to its speed on the stones while causing them to crumble behind it. This ammunition does not work in firearms with the scatter trait.</p>\n<p>The stones reach up to 100 feet, and they last up to the end of your next turn if no one collapses them. However, the line also can't extend beyond the maximum distance for a Strike from your firearm (usually six times the firearm's range increment).</p>"
