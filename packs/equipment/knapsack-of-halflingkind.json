The first compartment is lined in blue satin and contains an extradimensional space equivalent to a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Bag of Holding (Type II)].</p>\n<p>The second compartment has no lining. You can pull forth cookware and cooking utensils from it. Once they have been used to prepare a meal, the items transform into plates and silverware, and they evaporate once the meal has been eaten, taking any leftovers with them. The cookware reappears cleaned in the compartment 1 hour later. The compartment provides only kitchenware, not any food.</p>\n<p>The third compartment is lined with plush purple velvet and contains berry tarts wrapped in parchment paper. A creature can unwrap and eat one tart with an Interact action to regain [[/r 2d8+4]] Hit Points. The knapsack produces four tarts per day, which appear at breakfast time. Any tarts not eaten by the end of the day evaporate.</p>"
