            "value": "<p><em>Theater enhancers</em> resemble a pair of opera glasses. When worn, they allow the viewer to see subtle illusions on key props or stage elements that have been cast ahead of time. For instance, a puppet of a demon might appear to project a sinister moving shadow, or a backdrop of a mountain might have snowflakes falling over it. Popular among theatergoers who want a visual experience grander than what they can see with their own eyes, <em>theater enhancers</em> are largely limited to fancy stage productions that can afford the time and money it takes to enchant a stage with them in mind.</p>"
