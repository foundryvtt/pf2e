For 1 minute, you gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed and adjacent creatures that hit you with a melee attack, as well as creatures that touch or hit you with an unarmed attack, take [[/r 2d6[electricity]]] damage each time. As normal, this applies to creatures who choose to touch you, not when you touch or attack another creature.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Storm Chair]</p>"
