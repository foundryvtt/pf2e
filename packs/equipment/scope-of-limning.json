This scope captures the sound that echoes off a creature hit by the firearm and transforms it into light, illuminating the target for all to see.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> Interact (auditory, light, transmutation)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> If your next Strike from the weapon to which the scope is attached hits a creature, the sound of the impact transforms into light, causing the creature to glow until the end of your next turn. A visible creature can't be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] while they glow. If a creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Invisible], they're concealed while glowing, rather than being undetected. Because the effect requires a solid impact, incorporeal creatures are unaffected unless the bullet can deal force damage or has the effects of the ghost touch property rune.</p>"
