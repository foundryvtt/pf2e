An inflammation flask deals the 2d6 acid damage and 2 acid splash damage. On a hit, the target also gains weakness 2 to acid, fire, and slashing damage for 3 rounds. You gain a +1 item bonus to attack rolls.</p>\n<p>The target can end the weakness effect by three means: being drenched with water (such as submersion or exposure to an area water effect), being Administered First Aid (DC 20), or regaining Hit Points from a single effect equal to twice the inflammation flask's level. A creature that critically fails to Administer First Aid in this way deals untyped damage to the target equal to the inflammation flask's initial acid damage.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Inflammation Flask]</p>"
