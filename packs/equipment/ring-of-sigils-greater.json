This activation fails if the <em>sigil</em> is more than 100 miles away or if there's lead or running water between you and the <em>sigil</em>. In addition, if the <em>sigil</em> was placed on a living creature, you also determine whether the creature is alive, its distance from you, and any conditions affecting it.</p>"
