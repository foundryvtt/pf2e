It becomes immune to divination magic of 8th rank or lower (such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Locate]). This oil is permanent, but it can be removed with acid. Removing the oil in this way usually takes 1 minute for objects with Bulk of 1 or less, or a number of minutes equal to the item's Bulk.</p>"
