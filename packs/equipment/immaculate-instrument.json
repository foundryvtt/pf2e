A character who uses the <em>immaculate instrument</em> to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Perform] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Craft] can attempt the check at mythic proficiency once per month, and as long as they possess their <em>immaculate instrument</em>, they treat any critical failures with these skills as failures.</p><hr /><p><strong>Destruction</strong> If the holder uses the <em>immaculate instrument</em> to intentionally produce a work that is not just mediocre or crass, but one that devalues the public opinion of the art form itself in a showing of at least 100 spectators, the instrument fades away in shame.</p>"
