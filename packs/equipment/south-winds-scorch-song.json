The status bonus increases to +3 if the weapon has a greater striking rune and +4 for major striking.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: South Wind's Scorch Song (Damage)]</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">f</span> command (evocation, fire, magical)</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your spell deals fire damage to a creature</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: South Wind's Scorch Song (Speed Boost)]</p>"
