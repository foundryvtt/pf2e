For 1 hour after consuming follypops, your stomach gurgles and rumbles with magical potential. During this time, you can unleash magic in the area up to three times as a single action, which has the concentrate trait, with an area and damage determined by the type of pop; the third time you use this magic, the effects of your <em>follypops</em> end.
