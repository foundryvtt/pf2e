If the creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Invisible], the light's position means it's merely @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] to creatures that would otherwise be unable to see it, rather than undetected. The light also negates the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] condition due to lighting conditions. If the coated weapon doesn't damage a creature within 1 hour, the oil sloughs off and loses its power.</p>"
