If the creature is <em>invisible</em>, the light's position means it is merely <em>hidden </em>to creatures that would otherwise be unable to see it, rather than <em>undetected</em>. The light also negates the <em>concealed </em>condition due to lighting conditions. If the coated weapon doesn't damage a creature within 1 hour, the oil sloughs off and loses its power.</p>"
