The pieces slowly come apart on their own with time and movement. The process of attaching the plating takes 10 minutes and grants the wearer of the armor the 5 Hit Points for 1 minute or until lost. Removing the plating early destroys it.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Ablative Armor Plating (Lesser)]</p>"
