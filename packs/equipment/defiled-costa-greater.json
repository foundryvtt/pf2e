The first time any creature critically fails its saving throw against a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mask of Terror] spell cast using this catalyst, it also takes @Damage[6d10[mental]] damage, with a basic Fortitude save against the spell's DC, as it lives through the memory of having its rib torn from its body. A creature who critically fails against this safe is killed instantly. This effect has the incapacitation trait.</p>\n<p>Once any creature takes this damage, the defiled costa's effect ends, and no other creatures take the damage, even if they critically fail.</p>"
