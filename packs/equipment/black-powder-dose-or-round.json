Black powder becomes inert and useless when wet and must be kept in a sealed, water-tight container.</p>\n<p>The smallest unit of black powder that still has a simple use, a dose can be a simple package paper parcel around black powder or it can be packaged with a metal bullet or pellet to be used as ammunition. When ignited with a fuse or exposed to direct flame, a dose of black powder explodes. This isn't powerful enough to deal damage but makes a loud sound and could trigger further explosions. A fuse for a dose can be created with a few twists of paper and causes the dose to explode the round after it's lit.</p>"
