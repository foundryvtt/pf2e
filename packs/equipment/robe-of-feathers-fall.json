Dared to create a robe that would continually cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Gentle Landing]</em> during a brainstorming session at a local pub, a young wizard got the enchantment wrong. Instead of a robe that would let its wearer float through the air, they got....this:</p>\n<p>When you first invest the robe, and whenever you make your daily preparations, roll [[/r 1d6]] and consult the following list to determine the type of feathers. 1: crow; 2: duck; 3: ostrich; 4: chicken; 5: goose; 6: peacock. With each step taken, huge amounts of feathers sprout forth from the robe with great force. The feathers make you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] from all other creatures, but also conceal all other creatures from you. Of course, you cannot use this concealed condition to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Hide].</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: This item originates from the 2022 Paizo April Fools Blog post.</em></p>"
