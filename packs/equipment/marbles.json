You can pour marbles in an empty square adjacent to you with an Interact action. The first creature that moves into that square must succeed at a @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:13] check or @Check[type:reflex|dc:13] save (its choice) or fall @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone]. Once a creature enters a space with marbles, enough marbles are scattered that other creatures moving into that space don't need to attempt a roll to avoid falling.</p>"
