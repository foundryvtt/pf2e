Clever people can spin these clouds into small handfuls, creating a magical bundle of elemental power. Unlike most bottled breath, <em>spun clouds</em> don't have any effect on you while you hold them in your lungs, but you can exhale the cloud as a single action. When exhaled, the cloud flows out and expands into a @Template[type:burst|distance:20] within 60 feet of you. The cloud dissipates after 1 minute.</p>\n<p>A red cloud terrifies those it surrounds. Any creature in the cloud, or that later enters the cloud, must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:24] save or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 2} (or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 3} on a critical failure). Regardless of the result of its save, the creature becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours. This is an emotion, fear, and mental effect.</p>"
