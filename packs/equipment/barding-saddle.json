This leaves the mount covered with the barding and wearing a simple-looking saddle. The bulk of the saddle is unchanged in either form, but your mount is not affected by the restrictions, nor the benefits, of wearing barding while in saddle form. If the mount is already wearing any barding, this has no effect. You can make the barding return to its saddle form by following the same process.</p>"
