Paradoxically, this is precisely what the rattling bolts are most often used for, despite each one ringing like a shaken chain when launched. Once it hits the target, the rattling transfers into that creature's body. A target damaged by the rattling bolt must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:30] save or be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Deafened] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 round (or 1 minute on a critical hit). An undead affected by a rattling bolt further loses any lifesense ability it might have had for the same duration as the deafening.</p>"
