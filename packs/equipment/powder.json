In addition to other uses for powder, it can be handy while adventuring to help pinpoint invisible creatures. You can throw the powder into an adjacent square as an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Interact] action. If there's a creature in that square, it becomes temporarily @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Observed] until the end of your turn, though the creature still has @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed]{Concealment} due to invisibility. The powder quickly falls away or becomes invisible itself, preventing you from tracking the creature indefinitely.</p>"
