For 10 minutes after consuming chromatic jellyfish oil, you gain resistance 5 to precision damage and extra damage from critical hits. While the effect lasts, you ignore difficult terrain caused by moving through tight spaces that aren't tight enough to force you to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Squeeze], and you can move 5 feet per round when you successfully Squeeze (or 10 feet per round on a critical success). You can also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Crawl] at half your Speed.</p>"
