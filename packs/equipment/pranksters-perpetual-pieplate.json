Unless the target succeeds at a @Check[reflex|dc:15] save, they're splattered with a harmless but tasty mess, which remains until it is wiped away with an Interact action or is otherwise cleaned off (like if the target is submerged in water). After a minute, the mess disappears, and the pieplate refills with another kind of pie.</p>"
