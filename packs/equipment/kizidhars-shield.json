The shuyookh briefly appears just long enough to make a sweeping gesture, causing sprawling thorns to grow in an unnaturally symmetrical formation around the campsite, protecting it for the next 8 hours with an effect that's otherwise identical to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wall of Thorns]. All creatures within the campsite are then immediately affected by a three-action @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Heal] spell cast at 4th rank by the shield. After 8 hours, the wall rots away, and the shield can be retrieved as an Interact action.</p>"
