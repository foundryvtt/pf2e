While the armor is transformed in this way, you don't gain the benefits of wearing the armor. The armor remains transformed for up to 10 minutes or until you Dismiss the effect, at which point the <em>wall of stone</em> disappears and the armor returns to you, donning itself immediately.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Crafting Requirements</strong> Supply one casting of <em>wall of stone</em>.</p>"
