Among occultists and other scholars, it's known by its colloquial name: the Hunter's Hagbook. The book is a grimoire created and used by a legendary Varisian monster hunter. The <em>Hunter's Hagbook</em> can hold 100 spells but the spells below are always present in the book, can't be removed from it, and count against the total.</p>\n<p>When you attempt a saving throw against a coven spell, you can immediately end the duration of a spell affecting you that you prepared from this book. If you do, the result of your saving throw is one degree of success better than your roll (for example, a critical failure becomes a failure).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Caster's Imposition]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Blind Eye]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Blood Duplicate]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Hag's Fruit]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ritual Obstruction]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Web of Influence]</p>"
