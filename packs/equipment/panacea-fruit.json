The fruit has a counteract rank of 9 and a [[/r 1d20+30]] modifier for the rolls against each condition.</p>\n<p>The fruit's seed remains after consumption and can be planted later, becoming a seed-shaped @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Feather Token (Tree)] that sprouts a tree bearing many kinds of mundane fruit.</p>"
