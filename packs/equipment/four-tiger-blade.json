Each weapon is a <em>+2 striking ghost touch longsword</em> that leaves a noticeable trail of light originating from the engraved stars when it's swung. Those who pay close attention to the pattern of stars that shine on the blade might note that the depicted constellations change according to those currently in the night sky above.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> envision, Interact (abjuration, divine, incapacitation)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Attempt a Strike against a creature you believe to be possessed.
