While wearing the ring, you can attempt to detect the presence of undead creatures as an exploration activity. This reveals the presence or absence of undead in the area, but it doesn't pinpoint their locations. This ring can't detect undead whose appearance is masked by any illusion spell that is 2nd level or higher. If an undead is hiding or disguised, the GM rolls a secret Perception check for you against the undead's Stealth or Deception DC, as appropriate, with a +2 item bonus to your check.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">R</span> envision (vitality)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained] condition from an undead creature</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Reduce the value of the drained condition you gain by 1, and the undead that caused the condition takes @Damage[2d6[vitality]] damage.</p>"
