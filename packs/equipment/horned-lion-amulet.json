The figurine can be fastened to a suit of armor as a charm or adornment. When you activate the amulet, the lion's eyes glow with flames, granting you fire resistance 10 against the triggering damage and a subsequent fire resistance 5 for 1 minute. If the triggering damage was due to persistent fire damage, you immediately attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:10] to recover from the persistent damage. The DC remains at 10 until the persistent fire damage ends.</p>"
