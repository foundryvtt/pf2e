The arms share your multiple attack penalty and attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Grapple] a random enemy within 15 feet of you. On a success, roll [[/r 1d4 #Added Effect]] to determine an additional effect of the arms, which lasts as long as the target remains @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Grabbed] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Restrained] by the arms. On subsequent turns, you can use a single action, which has the attack trait, to have the arms either Grapple a creature currently grappled or restrained (with no added effect) or release any creature they currently hold and repeat their initial effect. After 1 minute, the arms disappear and the potion's effects end.</p>\n<p>The Athletics modifier is [[/r 1d20+12 #Athletics]]{+12} and the Escape DC is 20.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td>Added Effect</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>The arms cover the eyes; the target is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Blinded].</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>The arms cover the mouth; the target can't speak.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>The arms wrap around the limbs; the flat check for the target to use a manipulate action while grabbed is @Check[type:flat|dc:7] instead of DC 5.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>The arms crush your enemy; the target takes @Damage[6[bludgeoning]]{bludgeoning damage} equal to the potion's level immediately and at the end of each of its turns.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
