            "value": "<p>An <em>instinct crown</em> is a magical headpiece imbued with the essence of instincts that barbarians draw upon in combat. Each crown is fashioned to represent the instinct it's tied to, such as a wolf's head for an animal instinct crown or a simple helmet with Jotun runes for a <em>giant instinct crown</em>. When worn, the crown allows you to tap further into your instincts, granting you even greater benefits if the crown's essence matches your instinct. You must be able to Rage to use the crown's activations.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">F</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You roll initiative</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have Quick-Tempered and meet its requirements</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You use Quick-Tempered and gain 10 additional temporary Hit Points from your Rage.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (concentrate, rage)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're raging, and the crown's instinct matches your barbarian instinct</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Your body fights off the effects of magic with even greater effect.
