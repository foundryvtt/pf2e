Its crest is composed of eight appendages that curl around each other, resembling the swirling tentacles of a giant kraken.

You Raise the Shield. The shield's appendages briefly extend to impossible length as they wriggle and lash out at your foes, dealing @Damage[10d10[bludgeoning]|traits:area-damage] damage to all enemies in a @Template[type:cone|distance:30] (@Check[type:reflex|dc:41|basic:true|name:Kraken's Guard Tentacle Attack|traits:uncommon] save). The shield remains animated for 1 minute, during which you can use it to Grapple a creature within 10 feet of you without needing a free hand. When you use the shield to Grapple, you gain a +3 item bonus to your Athletics check.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Kraken's Guard]</p>"
