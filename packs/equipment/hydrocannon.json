            "value": "<p>This <em>+1 striking hand cannon</em> is crafted by wrapping the water-producing organ cluster of a grodair around its barrel, eliminating the need for ammunition, though the living tissue must be maintained with 1 sp of specialized nutrient feed each day. If not, its misfire check is @Check[type:flat|dc:10|name:Misfire Check]. If you fail this misfire check, the organ bursts, dealing an amount of @Damage[(2*@item.system.damage.dice)[bludgeoning]]{bludgeoning damage} equal to double the number of weapon damage dice to you and rendering the <em>hydrocannon</em> broken.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Tinker Shot</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (manipulation)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You fiddle with the pressure regulator on the <em>hydrocannon</em> and then make a ranged Strike with the gun. A successful attack has an additional effect depending on which modular configuration the <em>hydrocannon</em> is currently in.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bludgeoning</strong> The target is pushed 5 feet away from you; this forced movement is increased to 10 feet on a critical hit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Piercing</strong> The target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.</p></li><li><p><strong>Slashing</strong> The target takes @Damage[1d6[bleed]] damage.</p></li></ul><hr /><p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> The initial raw materials must include the extradimensional organ cluster extracted from a grodair. Harvesting the organs of a grodair in this way differs greatly from the normal method; it takes an hour and a successful @Check[type:arcana|dc:22] check. On a critical failure, the organ cluster bursts and deals @Damage[4d6[bludgeoning]] damage to the harvester.</p>"
