            "value": "<p>This +1 striking hand cannon is crafted by wrapping the water-producing organ cluster of a grodair around its barrel, eliminating the need for ammunition, though the living tissue must be maintained with 1 sp of specialized nutrient feed each day. If not, its misfire check is DC 10. If you fail this misfire check, the organ bursts, dealing an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice to you and rendering the hydrocannon broken.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Tinker Shot</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (manipulation)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You fiddle with the pressure regulator on the hydrocannon and then make a ranged Strike with the gun. A successful attack has an additional effect depending on which modular configuration the hydrocannon is currently in. · Bludgeoning The target is pushed 5 feet away from you; this forced movement is increased to 10 feet on a critical hit. · Piercing The target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. · Slashing The target takes @Damage[1d6[persistent,bleed]] damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> The initial raw materials must include the extradimensional organ cluster extracted from a grodair . Harvesting the organs of a grodair in this way differs greatly from the normal method; it takes an hour and a successful @Check[type:arcana|dc:22] check. On a critical failure, the organ cluster bursts and deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage to the harvester.</p>"
