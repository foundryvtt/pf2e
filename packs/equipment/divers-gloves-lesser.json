Each glove has an angular fin running along the outside edge of your arms, which forms a narrow triangle when your hands meet in a diving position. While wearing the gloves, you gain a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Swim].</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">r</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You would take damage from falling into water</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The gloves create a hydrodynamic barrier around you, dispersing the damage that would be done to you during a high dive. You take damage as if the fall were half the distance, to a minimum fall of 5 feet. You then Swim with the effects of a critical success for the check.</p>"
