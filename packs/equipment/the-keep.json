Its interior is a complex maze of locked rooms and barricaded hallways—exploring this keep can be an exhausting ordeal, but a character who does so can be rewarded by discovering a hidden armory. A character who wishes to seek out this armory must spend 8 hours @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Force Open]{Forcing Open} doors, portcullises, and barricades with a @Check[type:athletics|dc:35] check, after which no one may search for the armory again for 1 week.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You make it to one of the armories and discover a suit of +2 greater resilient armor. The type of armor is up to you, but it must be a common type of armor. For you, The Keep's armories are now forever empty, and you can never attempt this activity again.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You spend time pushing your way through the maze but don't quite reach your goal.
