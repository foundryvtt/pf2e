For the next hour, the symptom disappears and the wounded or afflicted creature doesn't feel as if it still has the wound or affliction, though all effects remain. A creature can uncover the ruse by succeeding at a @Check[type:perception|dc:17|traits:action:seek] check, but only if it uses a Seek action to specifically examine the snake oil's effects.</p>"
