            "value": "<p>Used by soldiers who battle on the borderlands of Elysium, particularly in Gorum's realm of Clashing Shore, these bronze spyglasses are somewhat plain-looking save for a single diamond set into the largest cylinder. An <em>Elysian clairglass</em> functions like a typical spyglass, but you can see twenty times farther while looking through it, rather than eight times farther. It also grants a +3 item bonus to Perception checks to notice details at a distance.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Seek and Speak</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>Elysian clairglass</em> casts clairaudience and clairvoyance on the area you are currently observing with it. As long as you're holding the <em>Elysian clairglass</em>, you can speak through the floating eye or ear created by its spells, causing your voice to manifest as a whisper that only one person in range of the spells can hear, as a booming voice that everyone in range of the spells can hear, or as any combination in between those two extremes.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Pinpoint</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate, manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Pinpoint].</p>"
