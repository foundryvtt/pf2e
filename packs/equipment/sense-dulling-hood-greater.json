From otyugh stench to a harpy's song, plenty of creatures use their prey's senses against them. A sense-dulling hood is a wide, single-use mask designed to be pulled from an airtight package and slipped over the head. The mask grants you a +4 item bonus to saving throws against auditory, olfactory, and visual effects for 1 hour. Since it dulls your senses without depriving you of them, the mask also imposes a –1 penalty to rolls and checks using Perception for the same duration.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Sense-Dulling Hood (Greater)]</p>"
