Jubilost invented feyfoul accidentally while he was attempting to create a cologne that would enhance its wearer's appearance to make them seem more otherworldly, but to anyone that asks, the gnome alchemist quickly claims that he'd always intended to create an alchemical tool that provided protection from fey magic.</p>\n<p>A single dose of feyfoul spritzed on a person in the manner of perfume grants the wearer a +2 item bonus to Will saving throws against mental effects generated by fey creatures for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Feyfoul (Moderate)]</p>"
