When the flare is lit, it sprays a concentrated cloud of pheromones to attract the attention of a specific kind of animal (see @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Animal Pheromones (Greater)]{alchemical pheromones}). Similar to animal pheromones, when you learn the formula for a pheromone flare, you learn the formulas for all common animals.</p>\n<p>A pheromone flare has a built-in delayed activation timer of up to 1 hour. When it's activated, the flare releases a cloud of pheromones in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:60] that lasts for 1 hour. A strong wind reduces the emanation to @Template[type:emanation|distance:15]{15 feet} for as long as the wind lasts. Moving the flare after it has been activated ends the effect. A designated animal that enters the area must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:35] save with the following effects. Animals with an Intelligence modifier of –3 or higher increase the result of their save by one step.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The animal is unaffected and temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The animal is unaffected but must attempt a new save every 10 minutes it remains within the area.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The animal is attracted by the pheromones, following the cloud to its source. The creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fascinated] until it reaches the flare and spends 1 round investigating it. After this, it becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the fascination lasts for up to 1 hour, though the animal can attempt a new save against the effect every 10 minutes. The animal takes a –1 status penalty to this save that increases by 1 with each subsequent failure or critical failure, up to a maximum of a –3 status penalty</p>"
