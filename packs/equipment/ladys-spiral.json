The handle of the whip ends in an oak spike that has been sanctified with ashes from Pharasma's Boneyard. If the spike is used to stake a vampire that's vulnerable to being staked, the vampire is immediately destroyed, without having to sever its head and anoint it with holy water. If the whip is buried with a creature, that creature can't rise as an undead as long as the whip remains by its side.</p>"
