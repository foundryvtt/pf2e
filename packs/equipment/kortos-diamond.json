            "value": "<p>The hilt of this <em>+3 major striking @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Spell Reservoir]{Spell-Storing} longsword</em> is simple and elegant. The blade itself is made of <em>throneglass</em>â€”a clear, jewellike crafting material with a razor-sharp edge, capable of absorbing psychic magic and redirecting it at the wielder's enemies. Whenever the <em>Kortos Diamond</em> is in an area of dim or brighter light, it glows faintly, as if reflecting the light of a setting sun.</p>\n<p>While wielding the <em>Kortos Diamond</em>, you gain a +2 item bonus on saving throws against mental effects. You can never harm yourself with the <em>Kortos Diamond</em>, even if @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Confused].</p>\n<p>If you ever travel farther than 100 miles from the Isle of Kortos while in possession of the <em>Kortos Diamond</em>, the sword becomes impossibly heavy; you are encumbered as long as you carry the sword and remain outside of this area. If you relinquish the <em>Kortos Diamond</em> while away from Kortos, the sword gradually makes its way back to the isle over the course of a year.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You attempt a melee Strike with the <em>Kortos Diamond</em> against a creature within reach. On a hit, you deal damage as normal and the target's mind is inflicted with a powerful disruptive energy. When the creature attempts to Cast a Spell, it must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:44]; on a failure, the spell fails and both the spell and the actions spent to cast it are lost. This effect lasts for up to 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">F</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You damage an aberration with the <em>Kortos Diamond</em></p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You deal an additional @Damage[2d8[force]] damage to the struck creature.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> command, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You hold the <em>Kortos Diamond</em> aloft and proclaim your might in a booming voice. You cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Overwhelming Presence]</em> (DC 42).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> A deity who ascended to divinity via the <em>Test of the Starstone</em> can damage and destroy the <em>Kortos Diamond</em> as if it were not an artifact.</p>"
