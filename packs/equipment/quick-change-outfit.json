            "value": "<p>A quick-change outfit is in fact two separate outfits sewn together. The specialized sewing technique allows you to switch quickly between the two outfits. You can use 3 consecutive Interact actions to slip out of the outfit, swap to the other side, and slip it back on. The two outfits can be of any kind (such as ordinary clothing and fine clothing) and appear as one outfit on one side and the second outfit on the other. The outfit's appearance is purely superficial, so you don't receive any special benefits from an outfit (such as protection from environmental cold with winter clothing), though the GM might still apply specific benefits like the bonus to checks with high-fashion fine clothing. You can notice the odd features of a quick-change outfit (such as extra seams) with a successful @Check[type:perception|dc:20] check. The outfit's price is equal to double the price of the more expensive of the two outfits it mimics, and its Bulk is 1 higher than the highest Bulk values of the two outfits.</p>"
