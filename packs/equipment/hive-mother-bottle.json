When you open the bottle, the effigy of a Huge ankhrav hive mother emerges, burrows up to 20 feet, and then erupts from the ground spraying acid, creating a 15-foot-by-15-foot pit that's 10 feet deep. Creatures standing in this area take 6d6 acid damage and @Damage[1d6[persistent,acid]] damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save). A success or critical success means the creature also leaps to safety, landing in the nearest space adjacent to the pit. A failure or critical failure means the creature falls into the pit. Climbing out of the pit requires a successful DC 22 Athletics check.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> Supply the corpse of an ankhrav hive mother.</p>"
