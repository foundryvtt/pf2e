While your eidolon wears a collar of the eternal bond, the collar bolsters their connection to you, allowing them to move up to 150 feet from you before unmanifesting instead of 100 feet. The eidolon can also Activate the collar to move even further.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Your eidolon focuses their will on the collar, allowing the collar to maintain the connection between you at any distance.

When the duration ends, if your eidolon is more than 150 feet from you, they immediately unmanifest.</p>"
