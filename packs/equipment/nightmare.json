            "value": "<p>A <em>nightmare</em> rune creates minor phantasmal alterations to a weapon's appearance so that those who look upon it see subtle reminders of their deepest fears. An arachnophobe might interpret the cross guard of a nightmare longsword to look like curving, twitching spider legs, for example, while someone who's afraid of sickness might see a nightmare club as a diseased length of bone crawling with flies. These images are all in the mind of the observer, but they also infuse the weapon with additional power. When you hit with a nightmare weapon, add @Damage[1d6[mental]] damage to the damage dealt. In addition, on a critical hit, the target becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} by overwhelming visions in their mind of personal horrors that linger. If you critically hit a creature that's already stupefied, it becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 2} as well. These critical hit effects have the emotion, fear, and mental traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 10 minutes (envision, Interact)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>nightmare weapon</em> casts @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Nightmare] to your specifications.</p>"
