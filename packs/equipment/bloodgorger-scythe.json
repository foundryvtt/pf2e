The target takes @Damage[1[bleed]] damage at the end of their turn. Each failure to stop the bleeding increases this bleed damage by 1 as a small scythe tree grows from the wound, to a maximum of 3 persistent bleed damage.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Sapling Slash</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> A target has a piece of the <em>bloodgorger scythe</em> broken off inside them and has failed to recover from the persistent bleed damage for 3 consecutive turns</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The sprouted scythe tree grows large enough to be commanded.
