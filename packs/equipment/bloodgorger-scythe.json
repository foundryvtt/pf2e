The target takes 1 persistent bleed damage at the end of their turn. Each failure to stop the bleeding increases this bleed damage by 1 as a small scythe tree grows from the wound, to a maximum of 3 persistent bleed damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Sapling Slash</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> A target has a piece of the bloodgorger scythe broken off inside them and has failed to recover from the persistent bleed damage for 3 consecutive turns</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The sprouted scythe tree grows large enough to be commanded. It makes a melee Strike against the target or a creature adjacent to the target, with a +18 to hit and dealing @Damage[1d10[slashing]] damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> The initial raw materials must include branches and roots from a scythe tree</p>"
