While the words are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] within a larger pattern and are nearly impossible to discern at a glance, they lend gravitas and power to the wearer's words. When the tattoo is applied, choose whether the phrase is of threatening words (Intimidation), persuasive words (Deception), or dramatic words (Performance).</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> Command</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You speak your meaningful phrase from your tattoo out loud, emboldening your words for 1 minute. During this time, you gain a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks and checks of the skill associated with your phrase. When you roll a critical failure on a Diplomacy check or the associated skill during this time, you get a failure instead.</p>"
