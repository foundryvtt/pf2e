Orc warriors covet these scar patterns and cluster them around what they consider to be their strongest assetsâ€”a pattern around the heart signifies a warrior with great endurance, while one along the arms indicates great upper body strength.</p>\n<p>You gain a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks. If you have Ferocity (such as from the Orc Ferocity feat or a similar ability), the first time each day you use it, instead of remaining at 1 Hit Point, your Hit Points are set to an amount equal to your ancestry Hit Points, even if this amount is more than you had before using Ferocity.</p>"
