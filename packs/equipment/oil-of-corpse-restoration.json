Spreading it over the bones of an undead creature or a lifeless corpse causes the gel to congeal, forming a cosmetic layer that covers or restores any missing or compromised flesh until the body mimics its appearance in life. The dead creature's flesh looks healthy and whole. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Deception checks to look like a living creature. The gel does not restore life or Hit Points and the flesh quickly rots away 8 hours after application.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Oil of Corpse Restoration]</p>"
