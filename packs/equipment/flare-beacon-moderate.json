They are often used to signal others to the beacon's location, to coordinate assaults, to request rescue, or for other similar reasons. Higher-level beacons have a radius so large that they can be seen from miles away at night. When you Activate a flare beacon, you can either place it on the ground in a space within your reach or toss it up to 60 feet straight up. A flare beacon in the air falls at a rate of 10 feet per round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The beacon shines bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light in the next 60 feet.
