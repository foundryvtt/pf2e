Each time they attempt to share information about these subjects with someone else, they relate only confusing or unclear details about you and this interaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature remembers your existence but no details about you or your interactions. For example, they remember speaking with an individual of your most basic biological traits, such as a human woman, but not your name, appearance, or other specific features.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature retains no memories of you or this interaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> If a creature learns the true name of a<em> forgotten signet</em>'s wearer and makes it public knowledge, that <em>forgotten signet</em> tarnishes and breaks in two.</p>"
