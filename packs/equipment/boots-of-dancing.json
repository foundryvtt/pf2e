While you wear the boots, the curse activates whenever you attempt an Athletics check or Stride more than once in a single round during an encounter. The boots cast an 8th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Uncontrollable Dance] spell on you, and you automatically fail your save. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the boots fuse to you.</p>"
