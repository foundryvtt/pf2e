Created by a long-dead order of scholars dedicated to Pharasma, the tablet of chained souls can be a powerful tool in laying uneasy spirits to rest, but its magic exacts a heavy cost.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> envision, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You present the tablet to a ghost, or lay it on a haunted site. The tablet's words resolve into a cryptic but accurate clue about the unfinished business that keeps this spirit from rest. Upon reading the tablet's words, you are subject to a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Geas] that requires you to right that wrong and lay the ghost to rest. If you die without completing the task, you become a ghost, cursed to remain until another recovers the tablet and discharges your duty.</p>"
