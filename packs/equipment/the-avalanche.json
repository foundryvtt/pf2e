            "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> When you epitomize <em>The Avalanche</em>, assign it to a point of interest in the mountains. Avalanches of tremendous scope occur here with great frequency. A PC who travels to this region can spend 8 hours and attempt a @Check[type:athletics|dc:30] check to clamber onto a perfect mountainside ledge to observe these breathtaking natural disasters. On a success, the mountains shift and change to match those of a mountain range that the PC is familiar with. From this point on, any PC can use the Enter the Harrow Court activity here to open a one-way portal to that mountain range, arriving at a location of import or particular familiarity within the region as determined by the GM. Switching to a new mountain range requires another @Check[type:athletics|dc:30] check and familiarity with that region. A PC who Enters the Harrow Court can now arrive in the demiplane at this point of interest rather than in Harrowheart's great hall.</p>",
