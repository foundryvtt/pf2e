In creature form, the figurine has the minion trait. It can understand your language and it obeys you to the best of its ability when you use an action to command it. The specifics of each creature, as well as the activation's frequency (if any), appear in its entry below.</p>\n<p>If the figurine is slain while in animal form, it reverts to its statue shape and cannot be activated again until 1 week has passed. If the figurine is destroyed in statue form, it is shattered and its magic is lost.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This tiny statue first appears to be a formless lump of jade until closer inspection reveals it to be a serpentine body curled into a snug knot.</p>\n<p>When activated, this figurine becomes a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.Giant Viper].</p>\n<p>The figurine can be used only once per day, and it can remain in serpent form for no more than 10 minutes.</p>"
