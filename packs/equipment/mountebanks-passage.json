            "value": "<p>This <em>+2 greater striking flintlock pistol</em> has the odd construction of possessing two triggers, one of soapstone and one of onyx, clearly separated with individual trigger guards. Originally created by a student at Blythir College in Alkenstar, the <em>mountebank's passage</em> has the ability to create temporary linked portals on existing surfaces. The weapon disappeared shortly after its invention, but rumors have circulated that it now belongs to a group of thieves who use it to commit impossible robberies.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> the <em>mountebank's passage</em> isn't loaded</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You pull the soapstone trigger. Choose a vertical surface within 120 feet. A beam of white energy crackles to the vertical surface and creates a white portal on that surface. Any creature who moves through the white portal comes out through the <em>mountebank's passage's</em> black portal, if one exists on the same plane. Using this activation causes any previous white portal to disappear, even if you don't create a new portal; otherwise, the portal lasts until your next daily preparations.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> the <em>mountebank's passage</em> isn't loaded</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You pull the onyx trigger.
