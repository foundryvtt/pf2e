Originally created by a student at Blythir College in Alkenstar, the mountebank's passage has the ability to create temporary linked portals on existing surfaces. The weapon disappeared shortly after its invention, but rumors have circulated that it now belongs to a group of thieves who use it to commit impossible robberies.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Doorway to Onyx</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> the <em>mountebank's passage</em> isn't loaded</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You pull the soapstone trigger. Choose a vertical surface within 120 feet. A beam of white energy crackles to the vertical surface and creates a white portal on that surface. Any creature who moves through the white portal comes out through the mountebank's passage's black portal, if one exists on the same plane. Using this activation causes any previous white portal to disappear, even if you don't create a new portal; otherwise, the portal lasts until your next daily preparations.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Doorway to Pearl</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> the <em>mountebank's passage</em> isn't loaded</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You pull the onyx trigger.
