The suit grants a +1 item bonus to Swim checks made underwater, and the helmet features tubes for connecting <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Bottled Air]</em>. When connected to a diving suit, <em>bottled air</em> doesn't need to be held and can be used to breathe as a free action. If you wear armor over a diving suit, you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1} until you remove the diving suit.</p>"
