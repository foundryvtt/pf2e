Shaking the bottle induces chemical reactions that cause it to glow. For 1 hour, the bottle sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 40 feet).</p>\n<p>During this hour, it can be thrown like a bomb. This requires a single action to Activate with a Strike, like other bombs, and deals the damage below. If it's not thrown within an hour of the first activation, it defuses harmlessly and is consumed.</p>\n<p>The bomb deals 4d4 vitality damage and 4 vitality splash damage, as well as 4d4 additional fire damage. As normal, vitality damage harms only undead and other creatures with void healing. Undead with a particular vulnerability to sunlight (such as vampires or wraiths) take the maximum amount of vitality damage from bottled sunlight (@Damage[16[vitality]] instead of 4d4). For any ability that depends on the number of weapon dice bottled sunlight has, count only the vitality damage dice.</p>"
