The door has the same Hardness, HP, and Broken Threshold as the shield, with @Check[type:athletics|dc:43|traits:action:force-open] and @Check[type:thievery|dc:43|traits:action:pick-a-lock] to open.. The door remains in place for 1 hour, until it's opened or broken, or until you spend an action to end this effect, at which point the shield returns to your hand (or falls to the ground in your space if your hands are full).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 1 minute (command)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The shield floats lazily in the air as bricks quickly fly from it to form a tall stone keep around it.
