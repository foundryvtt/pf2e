            "value": "<p>Goblin wizards invented the <em>amazing pop-up book</em> to store their spells without written words, though the tradition has been spreading to illusionists from other cultures. These grimoires have colorful covers and open to reveal three-dimensional scenes illustrating various spells. Goblins delight in constructing the books just right so a terrifying creature, like a horse or dog, pops up toward the reader each time a page is turned.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">F</span> envision (metamagic)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> If your next action is to cast an illusion spell prepared from this grimoire that creates illusory terrain or creatures, such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Hallucinatory Terrain]</em>, you draw forth the pop-up scene. If a creature succeeds, but doesn't critically succeed, at a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion, then just as their mind recognizes the illusion, a startling—though obviously false—illusion pops up somewhere unexpected in their field of vision, visible to only them, dealing mental damage equal to the spell's level.</p>"
