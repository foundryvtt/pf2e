            "value": "<p>Goblin wizards invented the amazing pop-up book to store their spells without written words, though the tradition has been spreading to illusionists from other cultures. These grimoires have colorful covers and open to reveal three‑dimensional scenes illustrating various spells. Goblins delight in constructing the books just right so a terrifying creature, like a horse or dog, pops up toward the reader each time a page is turned.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\">F</span> envision (metamagic)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> If your next action is to cast an illusion spell prepared from this grimoire that creates illusory terrain or creatures, such as hallucinatory terrain, you draw forth the pop-up scene. If a creature succeeds, but doesn't critically succeed, at a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion, then just as their mind recognizes the illusion, a startling—though obviously false—illusion pops up somewhere unexpected in their field of vision, visible to only them, dealing mental damage equal to the spell's level.</p>"
