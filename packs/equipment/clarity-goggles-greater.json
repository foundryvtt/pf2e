The GM rolls a secret counteract check using your Perception bonus against any illusion effect created by a 9th-level or lower spell or a creature of 19th level or lower. You must be able to see the illusion, and it must be within 60 feet. If the check succeeds, you see through the illusion for 10 minutes.</p>\n<p><em>PFS Note:</em> The Item Level determines the counteract level, not the character level.</p>"
