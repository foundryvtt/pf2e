In creature form, the figurine has the minion trait. It can understand your language and it obeys you to the best of its ability when you use an action to command it. The specifics of each creature, as well as the activation's frequency (if any), appear in its entry below.</p>\n<p>If the figurine is slain while in animal form, it reverts to its statue shape and cannot be activated again until 1 week has passed. If the figurine is destroyed in statue form, it is shattered and its magic is lost.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This simple onyx statue transforms into a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.Guard Dog].</p>\n<p>The dog has a +4 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to Track, and it has darkvision. When the dog senses a hidden creature with its scent, that creature is instead observed and concealed.</p>\n<p>The onyx dog can be activated once per week and remains in its form for up to 6 hours.</p>"
