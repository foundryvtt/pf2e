You can pour the fluid in an empty area adjacent to you, or over an adjacent frozen object, with an Interact action. The fluid instantly melts non-magical ice and snow in the area and harmlessly vaporizes the resulting meltwater. When used to melt magical ice and snow, quickmelt slick attempts a counteract check with the listed counteract modifier to melt the ice and snow, using the source of that ice and snow to determine the counteract rank and DC.</p>\n<p>Lesser quickmelt slick melts ice and snow up to 1 foot in depth in one 5-foot square, or melts the ice covering a Small or smaller object. The slick has a [[/r 1d20+6 #Counteract]]{+6} modifier for the counteract check and a counteract rank of 1.</p>"
