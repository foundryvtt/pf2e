Typically, an <em>accolade robe</em> is styled after a single wizard school, with appropriate colors and symbols. Wearing these robes grants a +3 item bonus to Arcana checks.</p>\n<p>The pockets of the robe tie to an extradimensional space that can hold 1 Bulk of items, none of which can have greater than light Bulk. The items must be related to spellcasting and academics—spellbooks, scrolls, wands, scholarly journals, and other academic supplies the GM allows. These items do not count against your Bulk limit. You can Interact to retrieve or stow items normally.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate—Review</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">F</span> (concentrate, manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute</p>\n<p>You retrieve an item of your choice from the robe's storage, then Recall Knowledge.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate—Extra Credit</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">F</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can spend only to cast a school spell.
