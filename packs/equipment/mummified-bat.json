When activated, the affixed weapon detects vibrations around you and guides your perception. For 1 minute, you don't need to succeed at a flat check to target @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] creatures. You're not @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] to creatures that are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] from you (unless you're off-guard to them for reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a successful @Check[type:flat|dc:5] to target a hidden creature. While you're adjacent to an undetected creature of your level or lower, it's instead only hidden from you.</p>\n<p>If you have the Blind-Fight feat, you gain imprecise echolocation with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. This makes creatures that would be undetected by you because you can't see them hidden instead.</p>"
