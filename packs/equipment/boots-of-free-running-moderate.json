The treads of these boots provide exceptional traction, with improved grip on surfaces you would traditionally have difficulty traversing. While wearing the boots, you gain a +2 item bonus to Acrobatics checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Balance] and to Athletics checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.High Jump] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Long Jump].</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The traction of your boots improves, allowing you to run along vertical surfaces for 1 minute. When you Stride, you can run up solid vertical surfaces, like walls, at your full Speed. You must start your movement on a horizontal surface. If you end a Stride off the ground, you must Stride along the surface again until you reach a horizontal surface or you begin to fall (though you can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Grab an Edge], if applicable). If you have means of walking on water, such as with water walk or similar abilities, you can also run along flimsy vertical surfaces, as well as vertical liquids such as a waterfall.</p>"
