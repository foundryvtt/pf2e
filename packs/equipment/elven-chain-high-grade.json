Because it's constructed with small, supple rings, it has no check penalty.</p>\n<p>Created by elven artisans employing ancient crafting techniques, elven chain is exceptionally quiet. Unlike other chain shirts-even other dawnsilver chain shirts-elven chain does not have the noisy trait. This suit of armor can be etched with runes like any other dawnsilver chain shirt.</p>\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> The initial raw materials must include dawnsilver worth at least 26,000 gp</p>"
