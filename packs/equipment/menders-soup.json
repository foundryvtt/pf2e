Civic authorities commission batches of mender's soup for workers if a tricky job is on the agenda. After you eat the soup, its effects last 24 hours or until you make your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. You gain a +1 item bonus to Crafting checks to Repair and restore an additional 5 Hit Points to items you successfully Repair during this time.</p>\n<p>If you eat mender's soup over the entire period required to attempt a Crafting check to Craft (typically a minimum of eating the soup each day for 4 days), the +1 bonus from the soup can be applied to that check, too.</p>"
