You must attempt a Crafting check as usual to create the item, but you need supply only raw materials worth a quarter of the item's Price, and you need not pay the remaining portion of the item's Price or spend additional downtime days working on it. While <em>Aroden's Hearthstone</em> is active, the stars in the sky, including Golarion's sun, appear to glow brighter within a 100-mile radius of the hearthstone.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">T</span> command, envision</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per month</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> <em>Aroden's Hearthstone</em> draws in heat from the world itself, causing the ambient temperature within 100 miles to drop below 0°F. Within 1 mile of the <em>Hearthstone</em>, the temperature drops to -200°F, rivaling the frigid cold of outer space and dealing @Damage[4d6[cold]] damage each round to every creature in the area. This effect lasts 1 minute, during which time the nearest moon (probably Golarion's) appears an eerie blue color to any observers within 100 miles of the hearthstone. At the end of 1 minute, the hearthstone emits a blast of concentrated heat that deals @Damage[25d6[fire]] damage to creatures and objects within 150 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> Using <em>Aroden's Hearthstone</em> to craft a cursed item results in a failed creation and causes the gemstone to split into five equal-sized but magically impotent pieces. Over the course of a year, four of theses pieces crumble to dust, while the fifth expands to the size of the original artifact and bears its powers anew. To destroy <em>Aroden's Hearthstone</em>, each of the separated pieces must be plunged into one of the five stars that compose the cosmic constellation known as the Follower.</p>"
