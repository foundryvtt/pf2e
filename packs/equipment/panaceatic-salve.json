That being said, popular folklore around this salve claims it can do anything from curing fevers to repelling vampires, a reputation that, if nothing else, is easy to get swept up in. When you activate a dose of panaceatic salve by rubbing it on your skin, you gain 4d8+10 temporary Hit Points for 10 minutes. At the end of this duration, if you still retain at least 1 of these temporary Hit Points, you can attempt a new saving throw against an ongoing disease or poison affliction you're afflicted with; if you fail or critically fail this saving throw, you don't increase the affliction's stage.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Panaceatic Salve]</p>"
