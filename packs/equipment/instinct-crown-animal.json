Each crown is fashioned to represent the instinct it's tied to, such as a wolf's head for an animal instinct crown or a simple helmet with Jotun runes for a <em>giant instinct crown</em>. When worn, the crown allows you to tap further into your instincts, granting you even greater benefits if the crown's essence matches your instinct. You must be able to Rage to use the crown's activations.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\">F</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You roll initiative</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You Rage, gaining 10 additional temporary Hit Points.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> command, envision</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The crown's instinct matches your barbarian instinct</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You Rage and draw upon your instinct to gain a boon.
