When it's activated, you can instantly impart up to 1 minute of speech (roughly 150 words) telepathically to any creatures you choose within 100 feet. You can impart this instantaneous telepathic message to creatures that you perceive and creatures @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] to you, but you can't do so to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Undetected] creatures. Once used, the whisper briolette becomes unusable and subtly vanishes within the next few minutes, rather than crumbling to dust.</p>"
