            "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> When you epitomize <em>The Winged Serpent</em>, a glorious, colorful statue of an immense couatl appears in a large meditation chamber in Harrowheart. Closer inspection of the statue reveals the countless fine etchings that adorn the couatl's scaly length. These carvings can be studied to learn how to cast the ritual <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Commune]</em>. More importantly, this chamber is now an ideal place to perform this ritualâ€”when you cast <em>commune</em> in this chamber, you gain a +3 item bonus on all skill checks made to cast the ritual, and it allows you to ask up to ten questions rather than seven.</p>",

As long as you have <em>The Winged Serpent</em> invested, you gain a +2 item bonus on initiative checks made with sight-based Perception checks.

You cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Foresight]</em> on yourself, but the duration is only 10 minutes. If you're at least 17th level, the duration extends to 1 hour and you can cast <em>foresight</em> on another creature by touch. The level of this spell is one-half your level rounded down (minimum 9th).</p>"
