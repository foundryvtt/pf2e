Closer inspection of the statue reveals the countless fine etchings that adorn the couatl's scaly length. These carvings can be studied to learn how to cast the ritual <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Commune]</em>. More importantly, this chamber is now an ideal place to perform this ritualâ€”when you cast <em>commune</em> in this chamber, you gain a +3 item bonus on all skill checks made to cast the ritual, and it allows you to ask up to ten questions rather than seven.</p>",
