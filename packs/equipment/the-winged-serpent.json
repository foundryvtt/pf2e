Closer inspection of the statue reveals the countless fine etchings that adorn the couatl's scaly length. These carvings can be studied to learn how to cast the ritual @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Commune]. More importantly, this chamber is now an ideal place to perform this ritual—when you cast <em>commune</em> in this chamber, you gain a +3 item bonus on all skill checks made to cast the ritual, and it allows you to ask up to ten questions rather than seven.</p>",

If you're at least 17th level, the duration extends to 1 hour and you can cast <em>foresight</em> on another creature by touch. The level of this spell is one-half your level rounded down (minimum 9th).</p>"
