When you invest the armbands, you either increase your Constitution score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"\\&quot;pf2-icon\\&quot; pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You clap the bracers together and remove a single condition of your choice currently afflicting you.
