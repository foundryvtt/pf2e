            "value": "<p>This ornate pipe is chiseled from a single bloodstone piece with wooden accents. When in use, the pipe gives off a vibrant red smoke that floats lazily in the air. These pipes are popular among bards and braggarts who like the ostentatious smoke it gives offâ€”and who often use it to create raucous diversions or send indiscreet signals.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The smoke forms a bird that flies up to 120 feet in a direction of your choice. When it collides with a solid object or travels the full range, whichever is shorter, it explodes in a @Template[type:burst|distance:20] of smoke with the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mist]</em>.</p>"
