In addition, on a critical hit, the target takes 2d4 persistent void damage; if the target has a shield raised, the shield takes the same amount of persistent damage (its wielder rolls the flat check to see if the persistent damage ends, or the GM rolls if the shield is no longer in someone's possession). Unlike normal void damage, the void damage from a <em>decaying</em> rune damages objects, constructs, and the like by eroding them away.</p>"
