You gain a +3 item bonus to Acrobatics and Stealth, and a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against attacks from reactions triggered by your movement.</p>\n<p>When you invest the cloak, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An enemy misses you with a melee Strike</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You slip around the attacking creature with ease.
