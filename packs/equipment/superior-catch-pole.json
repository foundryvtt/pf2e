Using this loop, you can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Grapple] without having a free hand. A creature grappled this way receives a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls when Striking with an unarmed attack. Due to limitations in the size of the loop, a catch pole can only be used on creatures sized Medium or smaller.</p>\n<p>A superior catch pole has a pole made of dawnsilver, and the loop at the end is silk rope, making it sturdier and more agile. It functions the same as a catch pole but gives you a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks made to Grapple with it.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Catch Pole]</p>"
