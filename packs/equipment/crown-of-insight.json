            "value": "<p>A series of evenly spaced, unblinking tattooed eyes line your skin. When you enter an area that contains creatures within 60 feet that are unnoticed to you, the GM rolls a secret Perception check for you against the creatures' Stealth DCs. On a success, the creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Undetected] by you, rather than @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unnoticed], and on a critical success, the creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] to you. All creatures in the area are then temporarily immune to your crown of insight for 24 hours. The crown of insight doesn't help you find hidden items or traps, nor can it help you discern a creature hiding in plain sight, such as a gargoyle pretending to be an inanimate statue. Additionally, since the effect occurs when you move to enter an area that contains creatures, it doesn't detect an unnoticed creature Sneaking up on you.</p>"
