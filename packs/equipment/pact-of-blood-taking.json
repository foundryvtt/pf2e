On a critical success, this persistent bleed damage is equal to half your level.</p>\n<p><strong>Payment</strong> You regain half the normal number of Hit Points from resting (including Hit Points gained from long-term rest) and from any application of the Medicine skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Hidden Condition</strong> The barbazu owns any weapons you find. No more often than once per month, the barbazu can demand a single weapon of its choice (often the best weapon in your possession). You are compelled to hand over the weapon immediately, without question.</p>\n<p><strong>Termination Clause</strong> The contract guarantees that you will not “be slain by the barbazu or by barbazu action.” This wording is vague; if any barbazu kills you, or if you die from persistent bleed damage from any source, the contract is voided.</p>"
