If any other creature wields the weapon, needles immediately erupt from the weapon's hilt or shaft, dealing [[/r 1d8[piercing]]] damage plus [[/r 1d4[bleed]]]{1d4 persistent bleed damage} to the wielder. If the weapon has a striking rune, this damage increases to [[/r 1d8[piercing]]] damage per damage die and [[/r 1d4[bleed]]]{1d4 persistent damage} per damage die; this counts only the weapon's base die and dice from the striking rune. The persistent bleed damage can't end while the creature still holds the weapon. The spikes retract once the creature lets go.</p>\n<p>When the rune is crafted, the crafter can choose to broaden the criteria for who can safely wield the item, expanding the users to creatures with a particular alignment, bloodline, or patron deity, as the crafter chooses. This criterion must be shared by the creature who contributed the blood for the rune.</p>"
