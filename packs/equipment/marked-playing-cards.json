A deck of marked cards grants you a +1 item bonus to Games Lore checks or other relevant checks to gamble with the cards. You can determine that an unattended deck of cards is marked with a successful @Check[type:perception|dc:20|traits:action:seek] check. Determining that a deck is marked during play is more difficult and is typically determined by a Perception check against the dealer's Games Lore or Thievery DC.</p>"
