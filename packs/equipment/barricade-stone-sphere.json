In its stone form, a <em>barricade stone</em> appears to be a simple pebble with an unnaturally geometric shape. The size and shape of the stone's final form depends on the type of barricade stone.</p>\n<p>When you activate the <em>barricade stone</em>, you drop it on the ground, throw it up to 20 feet away, or sling it using a sling weapon.</p>\n<p>Upon landing, the stone instantly and permanently expands. The stone grows to its maximum size. While normally items with the structure trait put creatures in their area inside the structure, this effect creates solid stone, so it can't be placed in an area where there are creatures. While it's likely to take some time even with the right tools, an activated <em>barricade stone</em> can be destroyed the same as any normal stone structure (Hardness 14, HP 56).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Type: Sphere</strong></p>\n<p>This smooth marble keeps its shape when activated, growing into a spherical boulder 10 feet in diameter. If stationary, the boulder can be pushed 5 feet with a successful @Check[type:athletics|dc:24|name:Push the Barricade Stone check]. If the marble was thrown or slung, the boulder retains its momentum, moving 25 feet away from you each round. A creature in the boulder's way takes @Damage[4d6[bludgeoning]] damage (@Check[type:reflex|dc:20|basic:true|name:Avoid the Barricade Stone] save; on a failure, the creature is knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone]).</p>"
