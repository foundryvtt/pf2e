When activated, the target's limbs become like lead weights. For 2 rounds, each time the target Strides it must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:23] save. On a failure, it takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speed for that Stride (to a minimum Speed of 5 feet). On a critical success, the dupe's gold nugget effect ends early.</p>"
