The integrated blades are etched with runes, making them a <em>+2 greater striking weapon</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">R</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You critically hit with the shield's integrated blades</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The shield's blades grow and dig themselves into your foe. The creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Grabbed] as it becomes impaled on the shield spikes. While you have a creature grabbed in this way, you can't Raise the Shield, but the creature takes persistent bleed damage every round equal to the number of damage dice. This persistent bleed can't end as long as the creature is impaled on the shield. You can Release the shield to leave it embedded in the creature. This ends the grab but doesn't end the persistent bleed damage. The creature can remove the shield and end the grab by attempting a check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape]. This normally uses your Athletics DC to Escape, but if you're no longer holding the shield, the Escape DC is 31.</p>"
