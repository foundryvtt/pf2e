Each night when you get a full night's rest, you can reduce your own doomed condition or that of the urn, but not both.</p><hr /><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Spirit's Wrath</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (attack, concentrate, manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> The urn shoots a bolt of void energy at a foe within 30 feet. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's AC, using a modifier of [[/r 1d20+15 #Spell]]{+15} or your own spell attack modifier, whichever is higher. On a success, the bolt deals @Damage[4d4[void]] damage (doubled on a critical success).</p>"
