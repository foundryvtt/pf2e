While the Stag Lord himself wears this helmet in the<em> Kingmaker Adventure Path</em>, stag's helms are actually the creation of the church of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Erastil], and worshipers of this deity find that the helm is not only particularly comfortable to wear, but that they can activate it once per hour rather than once per day.</p>\n<p>Rather than restrict the senses, a stag's helm enhances them, causing the world to appear in more vibrant colors and significantly enhancing the ambient sounds of the region without making them distracting. While worn, it grants a +1 item bonus to Perception checks.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">F</span></p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day (or once per hour if the wearer worships Erastil)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Choose a single creature within 30 feet. The stag's helm focuses your aim and grants supernatural insight into your next shot. Your target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Flat-Footed] to the next ranged Strike you make this turn against them.</p>"
