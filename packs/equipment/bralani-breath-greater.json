Sprigs of the flowers blow gently in a breeze of their own creation. If you cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mystic Armor] using bralani breath, you release a small blast of concussive air in an emanation of a size that depends on the catalyst's type. Some unattended objects are pushed away from you. Large or smaller creatures must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] save equal to your spell save DC or be pushed the same distance away from you.</p>\n<p>Objects of 1 Bulk or less and creatures that fail the save are pushed 10 feet. Objects of up to 2 Bulk are pushed 5 feet, and Huge creatures must succeed at the save or be pushed 5 feet.</p>"
