The miniature is made from wood, pewter, or other simple materials, and features a rune etched into the underside of the replica's base. <em>Marvelous miniatures</em> sometimes come packaged together; for example, the camping set features the boat, campfire, and horse miniatures. Activating a <em>marvelous miniature</em> causes it to transform into another creature or object, which then can be used as normal for that object. Each miniature can be activated only once, with most of them permanently becoming the item in their description.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This miniature can be activated only when tossed into a large body of water, such as a lake or broad river. It transforms into a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.vehicles.Actor.Cutter]. The cutter lasts 1 day.</p>"
