This allows them to create a philosopher's stone once per month during their daily preparations using advanced alchemy. Unlike other items created with advanced alchemy, the philosopher's stone remains potent for 1 month or until the alchemist creates a new one. This is the only way to create a philosopher's stone.</p>\n<p>At a glance, a philosopher's stone appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of natural rock. Breaking the rock open with a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Force Open] action (DC 35) reveals a cavity at the stone's heart. The cavity is lined with a rare type of quicksilver that can transmute base metals into precious metals or create an elixir of rejuvenation.</p>\n<p>To use the quicksilver, you must be legendary in Crafting and have the Alchemical Crafting feat. You can then use the stone's quicksilver for one of two effects.</p><ul><li>You can apply the stone's quicksilver to an infused @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Elixir of Life (True)] using an Interact action. This turns the elixir into an infused @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Elixir of Rejuvenation] instantaneously. This doesn't require any crafting time or additional materials.</li><li><p>You can spend up to a month of downtime applying the quicksilver either to iron to create silver or to lead to create gold. Treat this as a 20th-level task to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Earn Income] using Crafting, except that you create 500 gp worth of your chosen metal per day on a success or 750 gp worth per day on a critical success.</p>\n</li></ul>"
