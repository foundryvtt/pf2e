Each morsel is keyed to one familiar ability at its creation. When you feed the morsel to your familiar, it gains that familiar ability for 1 hour. If your familiar doesn't meet the requirements, or if it already has an ability from a familiar morsel, the morsel is nothing more than a pleasing snack, its magic wasted.</p>"
