The handkerchief can hold only one item within its extradimensional space at a time, so any item taken is replaced by any item already within the space. You can also use this action to expel an item already within the extradimensional space without replacing it. This activation can't be used on an attended item unless the creature with that item allows it. Placing the handkerchief over an item typically takes an Interact action.</p>"
