This is a fortune effect. Whenever you spend at least 1 minute talking with a living creature, you automatically become aware of its attitude toward you. When you invest the laurel, you either increase your Wisdom score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">R</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You're hit by an attack</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You take half damage from the triggering attack.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">R</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You fail, but don't critically fail, a saving throw</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You anticipate the danger and guard against it, often in unconventional or almost inconceivable ways.
