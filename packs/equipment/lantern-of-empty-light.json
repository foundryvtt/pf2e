            "value": "<p>It's said that the pale blue light of this eldritch lantern shines from another dimension or even is linked, somehow, to the glow of a ghost when it is consumed by the Outer Goddess Nhimbaloth. A lantern of empty light is not intrinsically an evil item, though it remains a favored tool of those who would manipulate the minds of others for sinister reasons. It can be used as a normal bull's-eye lantern, but prolonged use tends to instill in the user a vague sense of being watched by unseen eyes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> Interact (emotion, visual)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You direct the lantern's light upon a single living creature within 60 feet. That creature must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:20|traits:damaging-effect] save to resist the light's effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected and realizes that you attempted to mentally influence them with the light.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected but thinks the light was harmless, unless it knows the true nature of the lantern already.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fascinated] by the lantern's light, and remains fascinated as long as you Sustain the Activation, up to 10 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but you can Sustain the Activation for up to 1 hour. When the effect ends, the fascinated creature remembers any events that took place while fascinated only as indistinct, dream-like memories.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You direct the lantern's light upon a single incorporeal undead creature within 60 feet to siphon away some of the creature's essence, dealing @Damage[4d8[vitality]] damage to the creature (@Check[type:will|dc:20|basic:true] save).</p>"
