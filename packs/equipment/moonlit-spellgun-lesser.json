Its shape resembles a pistol, and it's often carried by hunters of werecreatures, vampires, and devils. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target's AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet. The spellgun emits a silvery ray of pure moonlight that deals fire damage depending on its type. The spellgun's damage is treated as silver for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target takes double damage and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] until the start of your next turn. If it has a weakness to silver or a resistance that can be bypassed by silver, it's also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target takes full damage and is dazzled until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>The damage is [[/r 3d8[fire]]]{3d8 fire damage} at night, or [[/r 3d6[fire]]]{3d6 fire damage} at other times.</p>"
