It activates when at least three creatures are within 20 feet of it, or if at least one creature stays within 20 feet of it for more than 1 round. It then lashes out with a torrent of electrical energy dealing @Damage[7d12[electricity]] damage to all creatures within 20 feet of it. Due to the fact that it doesn't trigger immediately when a creature enters its square, abilities like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Surprise Snare] don't work with a death coil. Creatures within that area must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:43] saving throw.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes full damage and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 2}.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature takes double damage is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 4}.</p>"
