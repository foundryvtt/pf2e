To anchor a grappling hook, make a ranged attack roll using your simple weapon proficiency against a DC depending on the target, typically at least DC 20. This attack has the secret trait. On a success, your hook has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold but actually falls when you're partway up</p>"
