The practice rubbed off on other inventors, who replaced the food with a drawing on an <em>inventor's fulu</em>. When you Activate the fulu, your critical failure becomes a failure, and you can spend just 1 minute to return your innovation to full functionality. The fulu then burns up, and its effects end.</p>"
