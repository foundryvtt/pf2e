The backside of each bail is engraved with a single ancient Azlanti rune: Patience, Remembrance, Resilience, Tenacity, Wisdom, Invention.</p>\n<p>While a bail is active, you recall pieces of childhood memories, brief stories and lessons spoken to you by Aroden. The knowledge imparted by each bail carries a specific power but also allows you to access the invested and resonant powers of the <em>aeon stone</em> in the active bail's slot as though the stone orbited your head. Each day at dawn, a new bail becomes active; roll [[/r 1d6 #Bail]] to determine which bail is active, determined by the table below. Only one bail can be active at any time.</p>\n<p>Once per day, you can attempt to exchange the <em>aeon stone</em> in a given bail for another <em>aeon stone</em> with a successful @Check[arcana|dc:35|name:Exchange Aeon Stone] check.</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr><th>1D6</th><th>Bail</th><th>Default <em>Aeon Stone</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Patience</td><td>Gold nodule</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Active Power</strong> Telepathy with a range of 100 feet</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Rememberance</td><td>Tourmaline sphere</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Active Power</strong> Cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Hypercognition] at will</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Resilience</td><td>Clear spindle</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Active Power</strong> Worn armor gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Antimagic] property rune</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Tenacity</td><td>Pink rhomboid</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Active Power</strong> Wielded weapons gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Vorpal] property rune</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Wisdom</td><td>Orange prism</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Active Power</strong> Skill checks for downtime activities or to Recall Knowledge are one degree of success higher</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Invention</td><td>Lavender and green ellipsoid</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Active Power</strong> You can craft items up to 5 levels higher than your actual level</td></tr></tbody></table><hr /><p><strong>Destruction</strong> The memories and lessons that echo through the <em>Tears of the Last Azlanti</em> give clues about steps needed to destroy the artifact. After you have gained the power of each of the six <em>aeon stones</em> at least once, you are granted visions of six locations across Golarion. At each of these locations, you must replace one of the necklace's <em>aeon stones</em> with a <em>dull gray aeon stone</em>. Once the final stone is replaced, the powers of the necklace are drawn into its new stones. These stones become pieces of <em>throneglass</em>, and the chain and bails disintegrate.</p>"
