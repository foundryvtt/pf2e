On a failed or critically failed saving throw, the whip casts a 4th-rank <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Suggestion]</em> spell on the animal with a base duration of 1 round, and the spell loses the linguistic trait. The course of action must still fulfill <em>suggestion's</em> requirements.</p>\n<p>If you can cast spells, you can expend one of your spells of 4th level or higher as a part of activating the whip; if you do so, the <em>suggestions</em> this turn have their normal base duration.</p>"
