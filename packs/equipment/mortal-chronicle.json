If you die, the date and cause of your death appear on the tattoo. The cause is literal and inexact, failing to identify specifics; it could read \"beheaded\" or \"immolated\" but not \"beheaded by Amiri\" or \"murdered with fire.\" If you're raised from the dead, a mark on the tattoo indicates the date you reversed your death. The tattoo then expands enough to list your next death when it comes.</p>"
