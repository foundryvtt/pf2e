A side effect of this resistance is that making magical weapons out of noqual requires complex and expensive alchemical treatments. Kevoth-Kul, the Black Sovereign of Numeria, has developed an alloy of noqual and cold iron known as sovereign steel to help mitigate this property. The metal's crystalline appearance might suggest that it's fragile, but the pale-green material can be worked similarly to iron.</p>\n<p>Objects made of noqual have a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against magic that the item attempts and grant their bonus to saves the owner makes specifically to protect the item from magic (such as against the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Rusting Grasp] spell).</p><h2>Noqual Items</h2><table class=\"pf2e remaster\"><thead><tr><th>Noqual Items</th><th>Hardness</th><th>HP</th><th>BT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Thin Items</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Standard-grade</td><td>6</td><td>24</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>High-grade</td><td>10</td><td>40</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Items</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Standard-grade</td><td>10</td><td>40</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>High-grade</td><td>13</td><td>52</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Structures</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Standard-grade</td><td>20</td><td>80</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>High-grade</td><td>26</td><td>104</td><td>52</td></tr></tbody></table>"
