A <em>shaping sweet</em> is a gelatinous, fruit-flavored candy that confers a whisper of this ability on you when you eat it. For 1 hour after eating a <em>shaping sweet</em>, you can make each of the following changes to your surroundings with an Interact action. You can make each change only once.</p><ul><li><strong>Alter Weather</strong> You create or eliminate minor precipitation in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30].</li><li><strong>Fairy Ring</strong> A ring of flowers and mushrooms appears in a @Template[type:burst|distance:10] around you, restoring 1 Hit Point at the start of each of your turns to a randomly chosen fey creature within. The ring lasts for 1 minute.</li><li><strong>Foliate Vegetation</strong> grows around you in a 10-foot radius burst, creating light undergrowth that lasts for 1 minute.</li><li><strong>Terrain Shift</strong> The ground in your space rises or falls by 5 feet, remaining at that height for 1 minute.</li></ul>"
