            "value": "<p>You can manacle someone who is willing or otherwise at your mercy as an exploration activity taking 10-30 seconds depending on the creature's size and how many manacles you apply. A two-legged creature with its legs bound takes a -15-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds, and a two-handed creature with its wrists bound has to succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] any time it uses a manipulate action or else that action fails. This DC may be higher depending on how tightly the manacles constrain the hands. A creature bound to a stationary object is immobilized. For creatures with more or fewer limbs, the GM determines what effect manacles have, if any. Freeing a creature from simple manacles requires three successful @Check[type:thievery|dc:22|traits:action:pick-a-lock] checks.</p>"
