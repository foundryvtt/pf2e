You activate animal nip by sprinkling it on the ground or a target of your choice. For the next minute, all creatures within 30 feet that have the animal trait must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:18] save or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fascinated] by the smell of the animal nip for 1 round. On a critical failure, they also fall @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone] and roll about on the ground. If the target is subject to a hostile act, the fascination ends immediately. Regardless of the result of the creature's save, it's then immune to animal nip for 1 hour.</p>"
