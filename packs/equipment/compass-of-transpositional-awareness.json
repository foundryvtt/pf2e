Attempt an Occultism check to determine to where the effect leads or led. The DC of this check is the effect's counteract DC. On a success, you know roughly the destination of the teleportation effect (for example \"the Plane of Fire,\" \"north,\" or \"Avistan\"). On a critical success, you ascertain the exact destination within mere feet for local effects (such as dimension door) or within a few miles for long-range effects (such as teleport, plane shift, or interdimensional portals).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span></p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You use the compass of transpositional awareness to triangulate your current coordinates and the coordinates of your intended destination using teleportation magic. For 1 minute, whenever you cast a teleportation spell that has a range, increase that spell's range by 30 feet. If the spell normally has a range of touch, extend its range to 30 feet.</p>"
