While wearing the mask, you gain a +1 item bonus to Fortitude saving throws against inhaled poisons. An <em>everair mask</em> makes use of magical runes related to the Plane of Air to create breathable air.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> envision, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You activate the mask's rune, and the air surrounding air, as well as the air you exhale, becomes enriched with oxygen. This allows the <em>everair mask</em> to recycle air into breathable air for 4 hours. The rune's magic is unable to provide breathable air while underwater, in a vacuum, or in any other situation where air is normally unavailable.</p>"
