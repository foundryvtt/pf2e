A bottle of colorful coating contains enough to slather over one 5-foot square within your reach or space and is made with a special dispenser that enables you to coat the surface using only one hand. It's possible to use the coating on any surface that can be painted (subject to the GM's discretion). Colorful coating dries instantly, and its effect in the square you coated lasts for 1 minute. After that time, the coating turns to fine, inert powder, returning the square to its original condition unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<p>Blue colorful coating contains bonding compounds that firm up a surface, making it more stable and more supportive of weight. When applied to material that's loose or unstable, the square can hold twice as much weight before giving way. The coating also slows any collapse, making it easier to avoid and granting a +1 circumstance bonus to Reflex saving throws in reaction to the coated surface's collapse.</p>\n<p>This coating can shore up a wall, ceiling, door, or similar opening, granting a +2 circumstance bonus to the DC for Athletics checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Force Open] the coated surface.</p>"
