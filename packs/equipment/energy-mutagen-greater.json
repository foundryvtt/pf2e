Whenever you score a hit with a melee weapon, add [[/r 1d6]] damage of the attuned energy type. In addition, you can end the benefits of this mutagen to unleash a @Template[type:cone|distance:30] of energy as a 2-action activity. This deals [[/r 2d6]] damage of the attuned type for every full 10 minutes of duration remaining (maximum 8d6) to each creature in the area, with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:25|basic:true|name:Greater Energy Mutagen] save.</p>\n<p><strong>Drawback</strong> You gain weakness 5 to the other three energy types.</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 hour.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Energy Mutagen (Greater)]</p>"
