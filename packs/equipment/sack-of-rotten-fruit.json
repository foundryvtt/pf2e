When you Strike a creature with a sack of rotten fruit, the sack is consumed while the creature takes @Damage[1d4[bludgeoning]] damage and must attempt an @Check[type:fortitude|dc:15] save. On a failure, the creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1}. The range increment of a thrown sack of rotten fruit is 20 feet.</p>"
