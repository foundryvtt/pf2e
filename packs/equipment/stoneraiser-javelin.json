The stalagmites are 10 feet tall.</p>\n<p>Everything on each side of the stalagmites has cover from creatures on the opposite side, and the stalagmites' spaces are difficult terrain. A creature takes @Damage[4d4[piercing]] damage for every move action it takes that enters at least one of the affected spaces.</p>\n<p>Each 5-foot-by-5-foot section has AC 10, Hardness 14, and 30 Hit Points. It's immune to critical hits and precision damage. A destroyed section can be moved through freely. The stalagmites crumble to dust after 1 minute.</p>\n<p>Any creature in the area when the stalagmites appear is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space of its choice; this movement is forced movement. Pushed creatures must attempt a DC 28 Reflex saving throw or take @Damage[4d4[piercing]] damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes full damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature takes double damage and is knocked prone.</p>"
