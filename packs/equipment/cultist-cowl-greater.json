When a character who worships a single deity dons a <em>cultist cowl</em>, the cowl's colors change to match those sacred to that deity, and the deity's symbol or rune appears on the lower front of the cowl that hangs just over the chest. These colors and symbols remain until a different worshipper wears the cowl. While worn, you gain a +2 item bonus to Religion checks. You also gain a +2 item bonus to all skill checks attempted to aid a ritual by being a secondary caster.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> envision, command</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The cowl casts @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Crisis of Faith] (@Check[type:will|dc:25|traits:mental|options:spell]) to your specification.</p>"
