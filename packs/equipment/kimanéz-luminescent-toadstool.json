For 8 hours, any corporeal creature that touches the affected matter even accidentally begins to glow with bright magical light in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10], which persists as long as they remain within 120 feet of the planted mushroom. A creature can move through an area containing affected fungi and plant matter without touching it by treating the area as difficult terrain and succeeding at a @Check[acrobatics|dc:18] check.</p>"
