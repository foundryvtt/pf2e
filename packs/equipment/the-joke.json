            "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> One of Harrowheart's workshops becomes staffed by amusing and witty assistants. These assistants, apart from being a delight to work with, help to prioritize and organize projects to be more efficient. Crafting checks made in this workshop gain a +2 item bonus (or +3 if you're at least 17th level), and you only need to spend 2 days at work before you attempt your Crafting check to determine initial success. In addition, the assistants can teach you how to cast the following rituals (with the expectation that you'll use these rituals at least some of the time for humorous shenanigans): @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Animate Object], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Awaken Object], and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Fantastic Facade].</p>",

As long as you have <em>The Joke</em> invested, you can attempt an appropriate Lore check instead of an Athletics check made to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Climb], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Force Open], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Grapple], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.High Jump], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Long Jump], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Swim]. For example, you could make a Mountain Lore check to climb a cliff in the mountains, or Sailing Lore check to climb the rigging on a ship.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> envision, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You perform a quick but amusing card trick with The Joke meant to distract others. You cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Laughing Fit] on up to 10 creatures in range of the spell. The rank of the spell is one-half your level rounded down (minimum 6th level), and the save DC is your class DC (@Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)|traits:spell,emotion,enchantment,mental|overrideTraits:true]).</p>"
