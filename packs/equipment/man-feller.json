Man-Feller is a <em>+1 striking cold iron @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Battle Axe]</em> that strikes particularly painful wounds into the flesh of humans it hews. The battle axe deals an additional 1d6 slashing damage to any human it wounds. This benefit doesn't apply against humans disguised as other creatures. It's up to GM discretion whether this effect applies against such a disguised human.</p>\n<p>Those who might find it amusing to point out the awkward and almost comedic duplication in the weapon's name would do well to consider that those who previously mocked the name of King Merlokrep's favorite axe to the kobold's face didn't live long enough to finish their self-congratulatory chuckles.</p>"
