            "value": "<p>A <em>spell reservoir</em> rune creates a pool of eldritch energy within the etched weapon. A spellcaster can spend 1 minute to cast a spell of 3rd rank or lower into the weapon. The spell must require 2 actions or fewer to cast and must be able to target a creature other than the caster. The spell has no immediate effect—it is instead stored for later.</p>\n<p>When you wield a <em>spell reservoir</em> weapon, you immediately know the name and rank of the stored spell. A <em>spell reservoir</em> weapon found as treasure has a 50% chance of having a spell of the GM's choice stored in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Channeled Release</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">A</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> A spell is stored in the weapon</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Make a Strike with the weapon. You expend the stored spell as part of this Strike; this empties the spell from the weapon and allows a spell to be cast into it again. If the Strike hits, the spell targets the target of the attack. If the spell requires a spell attack roll, the result of your attack roll with the weapon determines the degree of success of the spell, and if the spell requires a saving throw, the DC is 30.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Safe Release</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">A</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Harmlessly expend the stored spell. This frees the weapon to have a new spell cast into it.</p>"
