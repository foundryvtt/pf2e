A creature to which the fulu is affixed must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:35|basic:true|traits:poison]. Failure or critical failure primes the target for persistent damage triggered by a specific condition that must be met within the fulu's duration.</p>\n<p>Though this green fulu looks inviting, it has a foreboding aura. The fulu deals @Damage[10d8[poison]], causing the target's body to respond adversely to their ki. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes fire damage, it takes @Damage[2d8[persistent,poison]] as well. These effects have the poison trait.</p>"
