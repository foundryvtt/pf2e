When you spread this oil on an intact corpse that has been dead no longer than 1 week, its decay fades and the corpse is restored to the condition it was just after death. <em>Demortification oil</em> can't undo damage done to a corpse after death, such as consumption by scavengers. Applied to a non-incorporeal undead, a dose of <em>demortification oil</em> grants the undead creature a +1 item bonus to Armor Class for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Demortification Oil]</p>"
