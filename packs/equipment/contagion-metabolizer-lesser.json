When you drink this elixir, it attempts a counteract check with a [[/r 1d20+11 #Counteract]]{+11} modifier to remove the highest-level poison or disease afflicting you. The elixir has a counteract rank of 3. This takes longer for a disease—the counteract check doesn't happen until 10 minutes after you drink the elixir. After drinking, you become temporarily immune to contagion metabolizers for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>If you're a chirurgeon alchemist and have powerful alchemy, you can substitute your statistics when you create a contagion metabolizer using Quick Alchemy, if your stats are higher. This replaces the counteract rank with half your level rounded up and the counteract modifier with your class DC – 10.</p>"
