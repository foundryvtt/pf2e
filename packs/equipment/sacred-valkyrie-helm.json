When you start this activation, each creature you target with this spell mounts a conjured pegasus who then carries them through reality to arrive at the specified location; each affected creature experiences the 10-minute activation as a kaleidoscopic ride through strange worlds and realities atop a pegasus's back.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Storm's Arms</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate, manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> The helm casts a 9th-rank weapon storm to your specifications.
