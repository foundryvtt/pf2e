The sides showing a 6 also have the name and title of the shuyookh inscribed in Petran. If you whisper the name and title during a dice game using <em>jabali's dice</em>, they bless you with a bit of luck, granting a +2 item bonus to your Games Lore check. You can do so frequently enough to apply this bonus while Earning Income using Games Lore, but only one user at a time can do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Jabali's Gamble</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate, manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You call out the shuyookh's name and title, then roll the dice.
