You are also immune to damage from starvation. The navaratna does not otherwise grant you resistance against damage (such as fire or cold damage).</p>\n<p><strong>Activateâ€”Sutra of the Flawless Servant</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> (concentrate, divine, fortune)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An ally within 30 feet fails a saving throw against an environmental effect or a spell with the air, earth, fire, or water trait</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You offer a prayer for your divine protection to extend to your companion.
