            "value": "<p><strong>Price</strong> An indeterminate amount of one's lifespan, spent driving to the magic item warehouse, navigating its labyrinthine corridors, and consuming meatballs. Also some gold.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This classic, timeless suit of <em>+1 resilient full plate</em> is personally assembled from modular pieces of flat-packed darkwood, doubling as furniture and personal protective gear. To wear or remove the suit of armoire, you must succeed at a @Check[type:crafting|dc:41] check (yes, this includes the +10 modifier for an \"Incredibly Difficult\" challenge); on a failure, you and all creatures within @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]{30 feet} must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:31] save or be overcome with frustration at how you can't follow the simple, easy-to-understand diagrams for assembling the armoire, imposing a -1 status penalty to Will saves for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Suit of Armoire Frustration]</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> Interact; Once per day; You did not fail at the check to assemble the suit of armoire today</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You open a set of doors on the armoire's front, producing one fancy suit of clothes of your choosing.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> Interact; An enemy hits or critically hits you with a Strike, or you fail or critically fail a Reflex save; You did fail the check to assemble the suit of armoire at least once today</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You forgot a peg or bolt when you were assembling the suit of armoire, causing it to collapse to pieces around you, though this shields you from harm. The triggering attack is a failure, or you succeed at your Reflex save. The suit of armoire falls apart around you into its constituent panels, leaving you unarmored.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: This item originates from the 2022 Paizo April Fools Blog post.</em></p>"
