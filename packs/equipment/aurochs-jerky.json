Eating the jerky causes a pair of inch-long horns to grow from your forehead (or causes your existing horns to grow noticeably) for 1 hour. During this time, you gain a +1 item bonus to Fortitude saves. You can end the effect prematurely, causing the horns to retract or revert to their normal size, with a free action that has the concentrate trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Aurochs' Endurance</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">f</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You begin your turn and are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fatigued]</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You suppress the fatigued condition for 10 minutes. During this time, you are not immune to fatigue and can become fatigued by subsequent effects, but you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against effects that would fatigue you.</p>"
