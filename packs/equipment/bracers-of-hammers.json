            "value": "<p>These brilliant golden bracers feature a hammer motif as part of their engravings. While wearing them, your body surges with strength and you gain a +3 item bonus to Athletics checks and a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Disarm] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Trip]. If you succeed, but not critically succeed, at your check to Disarm a creature, the effects of your check last until the start of your next turn, instead until the start of the target's turn. If you succeed at a check to Trip a creature, it takes @Damage[1d6[bludgeoning]] damage or @Damage[4d6[bludgeoning]] damage on a critical success. When you invest the bracers, you either increase your Strength score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You reach for a foe and attempt to topple them with a powerful flip. Attempt an Athletics check to Trip a creature within reach. On a success, the creature is knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone] and takes @Damage[10d6[bludgeoning]] damage (double on a critical hit). If you knock the creature prone, it must also attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:35] save. On a failure, it drops any items it's holding.</p>"
