A fine spyglass made of silver is affixed to the frame; removing the spyglass destroys the sextant. By all appearances, the sextant shouldn't function, as the shades and mirrors are swapped, but when you look through the spyglass, you see a night sky during the day and the sun during the night, as if day and night were inverted.</p>\n<p>When you use the sextant, you gain a +1 item bonus to Survival checks, which increases to a +2 item bonus when you Sense Direction.</p>"
