Wealthier wearers sometimes pay for decorative embellishments made of more precious materials. Niyaháat is usually woven together with strong cord, forming a suit like a breastplate. This suit is worn over heavy clothing or a surcoat like padded armor. Some suits incorporate parts of powerful creatures, creating a storied history for the suit and its wearers.</p>"
