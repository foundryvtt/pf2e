If the spell reduces a living creature to fine powder, you animate that creature's ashes into a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-3.Actor.Sulfur Zombie] with the same general appearance as the disintegrated creature. You control this sulfur zombie, which gains the minion and summoned traits. You can issue a verbal command to the sulfur zombie as a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. The sulfur zombie crumbles into inanimate ash when reduced to 0 Hit Points or after 1 minute, whichever comes first.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> Supply a casting of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Disintegrate]</em>.</p>"
