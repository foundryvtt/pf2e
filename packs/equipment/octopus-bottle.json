When opened, a Huge octopus bursts forth, which can appear in water instead of on the ground. Its arms attempt to grasp a creature with a reach of 15 feet. The octopus repositions that creature to a different space within its reach unless the target succeeds at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:24] save.</p>\n<p>If the octopus is in water, it then releases a cloud of ink in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]. This cloud has no effect outside of water. Creatures inside the cloud are undetected and can't use their sense of smell. The cloud dissipates after 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> Supply a giant octopus corpse.</p>"
