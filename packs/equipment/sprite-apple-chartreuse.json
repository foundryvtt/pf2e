For 10 minutes after consuming a sprite apple, you shed bright light in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:20] (and dim light for the next 20 feet). While shedding this light, you can't be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] if you're visible, and if you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Invisible], you're concealed instead rather than being undetected. The light matches the vibrant color of the apple's candy coating. Creatures in the bright light are subject to another effect, depending on the type of apple.</p>\n<p>Creatures in the bright light feel more in tune with nature, gaining a +1 item bonus to Nature checks and to Diplomacy checks attempted against animals or plants (if they have the wild empathy class feature or some other ability to make such checks).</p>"
