The exact material the pipe is made of varies in every accounting; sometimes made of polished oak, other times ebony, sometimes stone, and in one Erutaki legend the pipe is made of pure ice that somehow holds a flame. Though the <em>wandering pipe</em> is not intelligent, it is rumored to possess a certain capriciousness, leaving the possession of mortals whose lives are not exciting enough but inevitably finding its way back to its one true owner.</p>\n<p>When held in one hand, the pipe grants its holder a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks but imposes a -1 circumstance penalty to Stealth checks made to Hide or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sneak], as its telltale plume of smoke gives away the bearer's position.</p>\n<p><strong>Activateâ€”Smoky Protections</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate, manipulate, primal)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour; <strong>Cost</strong> 1 Mythic Point</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> For the next 10 minutes, smoke gathers around you buoying your steps and protecting you.

It can only be broken by the hands of one of the Trickster's bonded mortals who is an honest person acting with good intent; it is said that if this occurs, the Trickster would also be significantly weakened as a result.</p>"
