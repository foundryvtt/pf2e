A traveler's chair has small mechanisms, either made from interlocking wood pieces, clockwork, or other devices, that allow the chair to traverse up or down stairs without any additional difficulty (moving up stairs is still difficult terrain, just like for other characters), and move through other common adventuring terrain without any additional difficulty, such as ladders and uneven ground.</p>"
