The soft flower bud belies the horrible perfume contained within. Activated by cracking open the petals, the rosebud exudes a noxious cloud that has the olfactory trait for 10 minutes. If dropped, it fills a 10-foot-burst. If you carry it in one hand and periodically waft it as a free action, the rosebud instead gives you a @Template[emanation|distance:10]. Creatures that enter or start their turn in the cloud must succeed at a @Check[fortitude|dc:24] save or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1}. Animals and beasts that critically fail are also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fleeing] for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves against the burglar's rosebud becomes temporarily immune to the effects for 24 hours.</p>"
