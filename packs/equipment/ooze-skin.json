The protoplasm also irritates the skin on prolonged contact, causing any creature that grapples or swallows you to take acid damage equal to the acid flask's splash damage. Ooze skin remains activated for a number of rounds equal to the level of the acid flask installed. The activation uses up the acid flask, and the armor can't be activated again until a new one is installed.</p>"
