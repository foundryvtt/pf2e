Sacks of dark pepper are readily available in the Roundabout Market, but are less common in markets elsewhere in the city. You can toss a handful of dark pepper at an adjacent creature as an Interact action. The target must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:16] save to avoid coughing to the point of choking. On a failed save, the creature coughs uncontrollably, becoming @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is instead off-guard for 3 rounds.</p>"
