            "value": "<p>Thera Heartslip commissioned these magical coins during her early thievery days and still has a number on hand to share with her confidants. This coin resembles an ordinary coin, but it's warm and seems to thrum slightly when touched. The coin's face features a very small fragment from the pressed portion that can be removed, such as a small star or one eye from the head on the face. Removing this fragment causes the coin to stop thrumming and feeling warm to the touch. Noticing the removed piece requires close inspection and a successful @Check[type:perception|dc:19] check.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> envision, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day;</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are holding the coin fragment</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You focus on the rest of the coin, imagining its complete form in your hand. The rest of the coin teleports into your hand, reforming the complete coin. If it was near any other coins, it also teleports up to [[/r 3d10 #Coins]] coins with it into your hand. The coin can only teleport up to 15 miles; if you are farther when recalling the coin, it teleports the maximum distance toward you and lands in an open space.</p>"
