The wire animates as it hits a target and attempts to wrap around its legs before vanishing a moment later. If you can apply the bow's critical specialization effect, you can choose to knock the target @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone] instead of pinning the target. If you cannot apply the bow's critical specialization effect, you can instead attempt to use the arrow to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Trip] with the Athletics skill as if the bow had the trip weapon trait. The arrow's unwieldy nature halves its weapon's range increment.</p>"
