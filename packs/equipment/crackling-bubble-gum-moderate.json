A creature that fails its save is also bound with sticky gum, taking a –10-foot item penalty to its Speed for 1 minute. The creature can remove the gum with a total of 3 Interact actions. These actions don't have to be consecutive, and other creatures can provide the actions as well.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Crackling Bubble Gum (Failure)]</p>"
