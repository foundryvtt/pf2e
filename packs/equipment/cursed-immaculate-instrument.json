Whenever the <em>cursed immaculate instrument</em> is used to produce a work, the holder must succeed on a @Check[flat|dc:16] or the work fails, leaving the holder frustrated and raising the DC of subsequent flat checks by 1. When the DC reaches 20, the work fails as normal, but the holder continues to attempt it fruitlessly to the exclusion of all other activities, including eating, drinking, and sleep, until they expire or the curse is broken.</p>"
