You can only activate <em>mountain to the sky</em> on an unoccupied patch of earth or soil. When activated, the walnut transforms into an impossibly steep mountain, 5,000 feet tall and 100 feet wide at the base. Climbing the mountain requires 8 hours and a successful @Check[type:athletics|dc:35|traits:action:climb] check. After activating it, if you climb to the top of the mountain without any assistance from flight or magic, the mountain <em>plane shifts</em> you to <em>Heaven</em> when you reach the summit. You can return the mountain to the sky into the shape of a walnut shell as a 1-minute activity, which has the <em>concentrate </em>and <em>manipulate </em>traits, so long as no living creatures are present on the mountain.</p>"
