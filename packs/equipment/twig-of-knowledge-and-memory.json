Each one is unique and fits easily in the palm of a Medium-sized creature's hand. When pressed to the temple or lips of a sentient creature, that creature can immediately attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about any subject using a corresponding skill (such as Society to Recall Knowledge about a humanoid); they gain a +1 status bonus on this check. This consumable is not immediately consumed on its first use, but can be used three times before it loses its power and becomes a mundane, if still beautiful, twig.</p>"
