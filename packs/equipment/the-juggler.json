Simulacra jugglers, as well as other types of street performers, can be counted on for entertainment at all times in the town square. A PC can spend 8 hours interacting with these entertainers to adjust their methods to match entertainment styles common to a specific city that they're familiar with by attempting a @Check[type:performance|dc:30] check. On a success, the entertainers take up that style, and as long as they continue performing in that city's style, a PC can use the Enter the Harrow Court activity to open a one-way portal to a marketplace in that city. Switching to a new city requires another successful @Check[type:performance|dc:30] check and familiarity with that city.</p>",

You can use all items in your hands normally, so long as they can be used or wielded in one hand.
