Its frets are inlaid with mother of pearl. With its mix of enchantment and illusion magic, it's favored by many traveling minstrels. While playing the lute, you gain a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy and Performance checks.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> Cast a Spell</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You expend a number of charges from this instrument to cast a spell from its list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cantrip</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Infectious Enthusiasm]</li>\n<li><strong>1st</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Bless], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ventriloquism]</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.</p>"
