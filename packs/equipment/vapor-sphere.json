You react to a surprise encounter with haste, activating this talisman and causing your body to momentarily become like vapor. Against the trap's reaction or the attack, you gain resistance 25 to physical damage and are immune to precision damage. This effect also prevents the reaction or attack from physically moving you (such as falling down a pit or being knocked prone), and after the reaction or attack, you can Fly 5 feet. When you end this flight, you leave your vaporous state and are exposed to any danger still at your location.</p>"
