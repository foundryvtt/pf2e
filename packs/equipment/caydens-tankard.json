            "value": "<p>This ordinary-looking silver tankard functions as a <em>+4 major striking returning shockwave light hammer</em> when wielded as a weapon. Imbued with Cayden Cailean's courage, you are immune to fear effects. Any liquid poured into the tankard transforms into a strong, alcoholic ambrosia that remains contained safely within until you drink it. Drinking the ambrosia Activates the tankard, with one of the following effects. If you aren't the one blessed to borrow the tankard, you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 4} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 4} while holding it, and its magic doesn't function for you.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">R</span> (manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You are targeted or included in the area of a fear effect</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Calmly swigging a drink on the battlefield turns your foe's attempt to frighten you against them.

Any effect causing these conditions ends, and if the source of the effect is an item, that item can't produce the effect for 1 week, provided it is of a level lower than the tankard's. If a target needs to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] an effect imposing any of these conditions, it automatically does so on its next attempt.
