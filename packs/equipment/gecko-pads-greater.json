When activated, they whir to life and improve your grip on surfaces, while slowly releasing a sticky substance stored within the device's surface to help you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Climb]. The pads give you a climb Speed equal to your Speed for 1 hour as long as your hands are free.</p>"
