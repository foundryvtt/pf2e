The stampede rampages out in every direction, swerving around your allies while trampling any foe on the ground in an emanation around your eidolon with a radius equal to your eidolon's Speed. Each of these foes takes @Damage[8d6[bludgeoning]|traits:area-damage] damage, with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:29|basic:true|name:Eidolon Stampede] save. On a critical failure, the foe is also knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone]. After dealing damage, the stampede of eidolons vanishes as quickly as it appeared.</p>"
