After Arazni perished at the hands of the Whispering Tyrant, Piereta became the first paladin to swear her service to the newly ascended goddess, Iomedae. When she fell in battle, a fragment of her spirit clung to the sword through which she had wielded her faith in countless battles, granting the weapon a sentience of its own. The sword named herself after her fallen bearer and has been a faithful companion to many Iomedaean warriors since.</p>\n<p><em>Piereta</em> is a <em>+3 major striking @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Holy] rapier</em> devoted to the principles of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Iomedae] as an exemplar of valorous action and as a protector of the innocent.</p>\n<p><em>Piereta</em> is very particular about who she permits to wield her.
