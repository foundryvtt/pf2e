            "value": "<p>This roughly spherical mass of orange crystal is about the size of a human head. The sphere is opaque but glows from within as if it contained a bright flickering flame—the <em>Hollow Star</em> emits bright light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light to the next 60 feet). Any creature within the bright light of the <em>Hollow Star</em> gains a +1 item bonus to Occultism checks. Deros in the bright light shed by the <em>Hollow Star</em> suffer distracting but pleasant hallucinations and strange visions, and they become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} when in this illumination. If you're lawful, you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 2} while carrying the <em>Hollow Star</em>. If you touch the <em>Hollow Star</em>, your dreams the next time you sleep are strange, unsettling, hard to remember, and carry a vague sense of elation, doom, or both. Upon awakening, you must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:25] save or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} by unsettling dreams that feel disturbingly like memories from a life lived on a distant dying planet.</p>\n<p>The Keepers of the <em>Hollow Star</em> believe that this unique magical item, if allowed to bathe for an unspecified amount of time in sunlight, will bring Azathoth into that world's sun to destroy it. However, the item has no actual capacity to do so. Yet.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> (divination)</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You cast a spell or use an effect that has the linguistic trait</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You speak in Aklo when using the linguistic spell or effect, even if you don't normally speak Aklo.
