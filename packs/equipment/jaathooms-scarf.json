The short ends are edged with a fine gold fringe that seems to sway even in still weather as though touched by invisible winds. The long edges have exquisite embroidery in threads that vary from a blue identical to the silk to the deep gray of storm clouds during winter. Wearing this scarf grants a +2 item bonus to Performance checks to dance and to Acrobatics checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape].</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Vanish</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The scarf casts 4th-rank <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Invisibility]</em> on you.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Jaathoom's Rebuke</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You let the winds around you catch the edges of the<em> jaathoom's scarf,</em> and a jaathoom shuyookh appears with a sudden updraft. The winds force your enemies back, granting you some breathing room in battle. Each enemy in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:18] save or be pushed 10 feet. A creature that critically fails is also knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone] after being moved. Creatures with the air trait are immune to all these effects.</p>"
