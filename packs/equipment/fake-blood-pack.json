Whenever you take slashing or piercing damage with the fake blood pack under your clothes or armor, roll a @Check[type:flat|dc:11]. On a success, the blood pack is punctured. You or an ally can puncture the hidden pack intentionally.</p>\n<p>When faking an injury, the blood pack grants a +2 item bonus to relevant Deception checks, such as to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Lie] about being injured. Abilities that trigger when a creature deals bleed damage, determine if a creature is bleeding, or are otherwise based on bleed damage don't trigger or apply for blood from a fake blood pack, which might mean creatures with such abilities automatically realize the ruse.</p>"
