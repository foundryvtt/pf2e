This crimson tattoo fades and becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Invisible] within a day of being applied, reappearing only when you Activate it, when you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed] condition, or when you die. The higher the doomed value, the more vivid the color.</p>\n<p>If your tattoo is plainly visible, you gain a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks against all creatures that can see the tattoo, but you take a –1 item penalty to Diplomacy checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Make an Impression] on those who understand the actual meaning of the spider lily tattoo (including all of Willowshore's citizens).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> envision (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> Your tattoo isn't currently visible</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You make the tattoo visible.

Attempt a @Check[type:deception|defense:perception] check against the triggering undead creature's Perception DC. On a success, the triggering undead believes you're undead as well—a mindless undead is likely to ignore you, while a sapient undead might react with curiosity or confusion. You can continue attempting Deception checks each round as a single action to Sustain the effect for up to 1 minute.</p>"
