While you have the Emerald Fulcrum Lens invested, your flesh appears waxen and pallid. You gain negative healing and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Harm]</em> spells gain a +4 status bonus to the Hit Points they restore to you.

On a hit, you force the splinter of Nhimbaloth's essence from the lens to possess the target. You're no longer invested in the lens, and the target gains the benefits as though it had invested the lens but can't activate the lens's other abilities. This effect is permanent, but it can be ended by any effect that removes a possession effect. The lens doesn't have any magical abilities until the possession effect ends; when it does, the essence returns to the lens.</p>"
