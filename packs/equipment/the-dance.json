            "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> A ballroom appears in Harrowheart, and it's always populated by a gala of dancers, performers, and partygoers. While these are all simulacra, the air of entertainment and delight is as real as any event that might take place on Golarion. A character can spend a glorious 8 hours relaxing, dancing, performing, and entertaining in the ballroom. The time spent carousing allows the character to restore their inner harmony and purge a disease they may be suffering from. The character attempts to counter one disease using a Performance check against the disease's DC. On a success, the disease is removed, while on a critical success, the character becomes immune to that disease for 1 year.</p>\n<p>In addition, some of those who attend the gala know of potent rituals that allow for ease of movement. A character can spend time here to learn either of the following rituals: <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Freedom]</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Word of Recall]</em>. If either of these rituals are later performed in the ballroom, all casters gain a +2 item bonus on checks made to perform the rituals.</p>",
