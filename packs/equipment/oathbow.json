Sometimes when you loose an arrow, its whistling in flight sounds like a voice whispering in Elven, wishing for the swift defeat of your enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">A</span> command</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You swear an oath to destroy one creature you can see. For the next 7 days or until that creature is slain, your attacks with the bow against that creature deal 1d6 additional damage, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to Track that creature.</p>\n<p>Your critical hits against the target gain the bow's critical specialization effect; if they would already do so, they instead increase the DC of the Athletics check to Escape when critically hit to DC 20.</p>\n<p>After you activate the bow, you can't activate it again for 7 days. If you kill the creature you've sworn an oath against, the oath ends and you need to wait only 10 minutes before you can activate it again.</p>"
