A special receptacle in the armor can hold an elixir of life, which takes 3 Interact actions to install. A loaded suit of living leaf weave can be activated to grow slithering vines from the armor, granting an item bonus to Athletics checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Grapple], to your Fortitude DC to resist Grapple, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Disarm], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Shove] attempts, and to your Reflex DCs to resist @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Trip] attempts. The effects last for 3 rounds, consuming the elixir of life, and once the reaction has begun it can't be deactivated.</p>"
