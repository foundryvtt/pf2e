When applied to a wall inside a room, all creatures within the room gain an item bonus to Stealth checks against creatures outside the room.</p>\n<p>The fulu can shield a room of up to 90 square feet, grants a +2 item bonus, and has a duration of 24 hours. If you become hidden within the room, you automatically become undetected to creatures of the fulu's level or lower.</p>"
