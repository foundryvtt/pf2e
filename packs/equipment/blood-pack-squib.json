A <em>blood pack squib</em> is a small unassuming stone that is keyed to a single fake blood pack in a process that takes 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Activateâ€”Burst Pack</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The blood pack squib must be within 20 feet of its associated fake blood pack</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You lightly squeeze the stone and the fake blood pack dramatically bursts. The creature wearing the fake blood pack gains the benefits of a punctured fake blood pack. A single creature adjacent to the creature wearing the fake blood pack must succeed at a @Check[reflex|dc:16] save or be splattered with the fake blood, becoming @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] until the end of their next turn. You can also activate the blood pack squib as a reaction when the fake blood pack is punctured normally.</p>"
