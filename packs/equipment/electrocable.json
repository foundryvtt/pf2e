While on, the coils electrify the cable, dealing @Damage[1d6[electricity]] and @Damage[1d6[fire]] damage in a thin precise line to anything the cable touches, though the cable is too unwieldy to use as a weapon. Electrocables are typically used to \"cut\" a thin straight line through metal. They ignore 10 points of a metal object's hardness.</p>"
