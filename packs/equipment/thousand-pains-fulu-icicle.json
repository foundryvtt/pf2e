A creature to which the fulu is affixed must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:30|basic:true|traits:cold]. Failure or critical failure primes the target for persistent damage triggered by a specific condition that must be met within the fulu's duration.</p>\n<p>Looking at this black fulu leaves you queasy and cold. The fulu deals @Damage[10d6[cold]] as the target's ki warps and drains. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes damage from a poison or disease effect or becomes sickened, it takes @Damage[2d6[persistent,cold]]. These effects have the cold trait.</p>"
