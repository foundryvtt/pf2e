Activating a feather token causes it to transform into another object, which then can be used as normal for that object. Each feather can be activated only once, with most of them permanently becoming the item in their description.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">A</span> Strike from a ranged weapon</p>\n<p>This token can be activated only on an unoccupied patch of earth or soil.
