The weapon's runes and any precious material it's made of apply to the weapon's new shape. Any property runes that can't apply to the new form are suppressed until the item takes a shape to which they can apply.</p>\n<p>The weapons a <em>shifting</em> weapon can turn into are based on the base attributes of the weapon, so reference the weapon's Hands entry in the weapons table to see what it can turn into. For example, a bastard sword requires one hand, even though it gets a benefit in two hands from the two-hand trait. Therefore, a <em>shifting bastard sword</em> could turn into a longsword, but not a greatsword. Activating this rune doesn't change how many hands you're currently using to hold the weapon.</p>"
