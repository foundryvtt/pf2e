A creature hit by activated blister ammunition must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:19] save or begin to itch uncontrollably for 3 rounds in addition to damage the attack normally deals. On a critical hit, increase the Fortitude DC by 2 (@Check[type:fortitude|dc:21]), and the target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] for 1 round. For the duration, each time the target attempts a concentrate action, it must attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:8], losing the action on a failure. An affected creature can use a single Interact action to scratch and sneeze, allowing it to automatically pass the flat check. The effect ends early once an affected creature spends 3 Interact actions scratching and sneezing. These Interact actions don't need to be consecutive.</p>"
