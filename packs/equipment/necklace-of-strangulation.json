When invested, it magically locks in place, suspiciously tightly, and fuses to you. When you enter a situation of extreme stress (as determined by the GM), the necklace tightens around your neck, suffocating you and dealing @Damage[30[bludgeoning]] damage to you at the end of each of your turns. Once per round, you can spend a single action to attempt a @Check[type:athletics|dc:34] check or @Check[type:fortitude|dc:34] save; success means you don't take the damage on your current turn, but you continue suffocating. The necklace loosens after you've been dead for a month.</p>"
