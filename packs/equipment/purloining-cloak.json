The cloak became infused with a daredevil spirit and a penchant for high-stakes thievery. If its owner isn't willing to partake in such activities, the cloak tries to convince them to sell or give it to someone who will. A purloining cloak can use tendrils of its cloth to attempt Thievery checks to Palm an Object or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Steal], proudly offering you its loot later. In addition to those of a mercurial mantle, a purloining cloak has the following activations.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> command, envision</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The cloak casts 2nd-rank <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Illusory Disguise]</em> on you, usually to your specifications. However the cloak can choose the appearance of the illusion for you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The cloak assesses the price of valuables it can see.
