The cloak became infused with a daredevil spirit and a penchant for high-stakes thievery. If its owner isn't willing to partake in such activities, the cloak tries to convince them to sell or give it to someone who will. A purloining cloak can use tendrils of its cloth to attempt Thievery checks to Palm an Object or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Steal], proudly offering you its loot later. In addition to those of a mercurial mantle, a purloining cloak has the following activations.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> command, envision</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The cloak casts 2nd-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Illusory Disguise]</em> on you, usually to your specifications. However the cloak can choose the appearance of the illusion for you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The cloak assesses the price of valuables it can see. This valuation doesn't include the value of features the cloak can't discern, such as magical properties.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">r</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An enemy misses you with a melee Strike</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You slip around the attacking creature with ease. You Step, without moving away from the triggering enemy, and then make a melee Strike against the triggering enemy if it's within reach. If you do make a Strike, the target attempts a @Check[type:perception|dc:38|name:Detect Reaction|showDC:all] check before you roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> This creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Flat-Footed] against the Strike.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> This creature is flat-footed against all your attacks until the end of their next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> command, envision (conjuration, teleportation)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The cloak hums with power as your whirl it around yourself, disappearing amid a brief flash of light.
