In its disk form, it has negligible Bulk and must be held in one hand to be activated. In the other forms, it has the same Bulk as a normal weapon of its type. You can switch your grip as part of the activation.</p>\n<p>When you expand the item, you can use the force of the expansion to High Jump or to try to Force Open a door or the like by wedging the disk into a gap before activation. The staff makes the Athletics check with a [[/r 1d20+15]] modifier.</p>"
