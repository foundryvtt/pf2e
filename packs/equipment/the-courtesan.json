This doppelganger reflexively shifts their appearance to become an attractive romantic partner to whomever they speak with. <em>The Courtesan</em> can grant a character who visits them for at least 8 hours a special charm the character can carry on their person. The charm casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Contingency]</em> on the character, with the level of the spell being one-half their level, rounded down (minimum 7th level), and allows the character to select any common arcane spell of the appropriate level for the triggered spell. The trigger under which the spell would be cast in this case is always \"grasping the charm as an Interact action.\" This contingency effect lasts until it is triggered, but a character may only have one charm from <em>The Courtesan</em> active at any one time, and can only receive a charm once per level.</p>",

The level of the spell is one-half your level, rounded down (minimum 6th level). You can change your appearance again at any time during the duration by using a three-action activity, which has the concentrate trait. While under these effects, your Deception checks to Impersonate are one degree of success greater when you use them against a creature that is a lower level than yourself.</p>"
