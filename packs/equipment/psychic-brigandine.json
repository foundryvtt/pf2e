You gain resistance 5 to mental damage.</p>\n<p>Whenever you use the armor to become invisible, you also become psychically invisible. Each time you would be affected by an effect with the mental trait while you are invisible, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:17] check. On a success, it doesn't affect you.</p>"
