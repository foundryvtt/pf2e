This illusion can be seen through with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Truesight] or similar magic, and anyone who interacts with the item feels its wet, sticky surface, allowing them to attempt to disbelieve the illusion (@Check[type:perception|dc:19|immutable:true]). Many hags claim a hag eye is more effective if plucked from a living, awake creature, but this is likely just a convenient excuse for sadism.</p>\n<p>The hag eye produces no direct benefit for the wearer, but allows the hag who created it, or any member of their coven, to peer through the eye using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] action. This has no range limit, provided the hag is on the same plane.</p>\n<p>Any damage dealt to the eye destroys it. If this happens while a hag is looking through it, the hag is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Blinded] for 1 hour.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> You are a hag.</p>"
