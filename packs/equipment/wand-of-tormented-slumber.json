A creature knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious] by this spell takes @Damage[1d6[persistent,mental]]. This damage wakes the creature from unconsciousness only if it deals 4 or more damage on a single roll. If the creature awakens from its unconsciousness due to damage (whether it was the persistent mental damage or not), it's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 1}. If it awakens from damage on its own turn, the creature doesn't reduce its frightened condition automatically on that turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> Supply a casting of 4th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Sleep].</p>"
