            "value": "<p>A miniature toy carriage is carved from wood and has fully functioning wheels. It can vary in size from 2 to 8 inches long, too small for even Tiny creatures to ride. If pushed or propelled, obstacles and terrain might slow, stop, tip, or divert the carriage's course.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A tiny crank protrudes from the side of this carriage. If the crank is wound and the carriage is released on the ground, the carriage propels in a straight line at a Speed of 10 feet. Each Interact action spent winding the crank propels the carriage for 1 round. A windup toy carriage can be wound for a maximum of 9 actions total, at which point it's too tight to wind further.</p>"
