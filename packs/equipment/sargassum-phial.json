You can throw the phial up to 30 feet when you Activate it. When opened or thrown, a Medium sargassum heap effigy reconstitutes to release a hallucinogenic cloud in a @Template[emanation|distance:15], forcing each creature to attempt a @Check[fortitude|dc:20] save. On a failure, a creature rolls [[/r 1d4 #hallucination]] to determine what it is hallucinating for the next [[/gmr 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds} (unless otherwise noted). At the beginning of their turn, an affected creature attempts a new save.</p>\n<p><strong>1</strong> The target thinks they are sinking through the floor.
