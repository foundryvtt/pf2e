You can throw the phial up to 30 feet when you Activate it. When opened or thrown, a Medium sargassum heap effigy reconstitutes to release a hallucinogenic cloud in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:15], forcing each creature to attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. On a failure, a creature rolls 1d4 to determine what it is hallucinating for the next [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds} (unless otherwise noted). At the beginning of their turn, an affected creature attempts a new save.</p>\n<p><strong>1</strong> The target thinks they are sinking through the floor. It falls @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone] and spends 1 action on its next turn flailing its limbs as if attempting to swim.</p>\n<p><strong>2</strong> The target thinks an item they are holding turns into a viper. The target Releases the item and spends its next turn @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fleeing] from it.</p>\n<p><strong>3</strong> The target thinks they have shrunk to 1/10 their normal size. For 1 round, it is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 2}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 2}, and takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speed.</p>\n<p><strong>4</strong> The target believes they are melting.
