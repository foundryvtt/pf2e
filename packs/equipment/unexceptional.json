Conversely, many thieves in Highhelm apply these runes to stolen goods to help them smuggle items out of the city. The item gains the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Disguise Magic]</em> to appear as non-magical. The rune's effects also cause anyone who closely observes or holds the item to believe it is a mundane version of that type of item, such as believing a magical dagger to be an ordinary dagger, unless the creature succeeds at a @Check[type:will|dc:18] save. Creatures that succeed their save see that there is more to the item than meets the eye, but aren't immediately aware of the <em>magic aura</em> effect.</p>"
