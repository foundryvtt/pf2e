Expend a spell slot in which you've prepared a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Harm] spell to restore 1d8 Hit Points to your undead minion per level of the expended spell slot, before applying the damage. If this prevents the minion from being reduced to 0 Hit Points, it isn't destroyed.</p>"
