It serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe. A <em>wayfinder</em> functions as a compass.</p>\n<p>An indentation in the middle of the <em>wayfinder</em> can hold a single <em>aeon stone</em>. Placing an <em>aeon stone</em> in this indentation provides you all the benefits of having the <em>aeon stone</em> orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. You invest a <em>wayfinder</em> and the <em>aeon stone</em> within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit. An invested <em>aeon stone</em> slotted in a <em>wayfinder</em> also grants its resonant power.</p>\n<p>If you have more than one <em>wayfinder</em> with an invested <em>aeon stone</em> on your person at a given time, destructive interference from their resonance prevents you from gaining benefits from any of them. You can still benefit from additional <em>aeon stones</em> orbiting your head, just not in <em>wayfinders</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Activateâ€”Light</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">A</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>wayfinder</em> is targeted by a 1st-rank <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Light]</em> spell.</p>"
