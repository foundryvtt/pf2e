If there is no such figure in local lore, the cloak of the false foe instead alters your appearance into a form imagined by the crafter of the cloak. One choice that occurs with disturbing frequency is a gaunt figure with triple-jointed fingers; an eyeless, hairless head with a lamprey mouth in the center of its face; and stubby tentacles waving down its neck. The transformation also grants the effects of either a 3rd-rank <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Humanoid Form]</em> spell that lasts for 1 hour if you turn into a Medium cryptid, or a 5th-rank humanoid form spell that lasts for 10 minutes if you turn into a Large cryptid.</p>\n<p>While you're in cryptid form, any wounds left by your spells and Strikes appear to be the result of the cryptid's unarmed attacks and special abilities to a casual inspection. This doesn't alter the actual damage type inflicted or the effects of such attack. Someone closely studying the wounds can, with a successful @Check[type:medicine|dc:30] check, realize that magic has altered the appearance of the injuries.</p>"
