When you activate psyche salts, you uncork and pass the open end of the vial near the head of an adjacent creature. The salts within fizz and evaporate, creating a sour-smelling cloud that envelops the creature's head before fading. As they do, the vapors attempt to clear harmful influences from the creature's mind. The creature gains the effect of a 8th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Clear Mind] spell with a [[/gmr 1d20+27 #Counteract]]{+27} counteract check modifier and a +3 item bonus to saving throws against mental effects for 10 minutes.</p>"
