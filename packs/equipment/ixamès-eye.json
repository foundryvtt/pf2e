The dragon's sense of vision isn't impaired, and her eyes can't be removed from her head until she's destroyed. Once removed, each gem functions as a special talisman.</p>\n<p><em>Ixamè's eye</em> sparkles when it's in an area of fog or mist. Activating the talisman enables you to see clearly through fog and mist for 1 minute; any creature concealed only by fog or mist is no longer concealed to you. If such a creature was relying on the concealment to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Hide] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sneak], this also means it's no longer hidden or undetected.</p>"
