Each creature within a @Template[emanation|distance:20] must attempt a @Check[will|dc:31|traits:auditory,incapacitation,mental] save to resist the song. Creatures that attempt this save become temporarily immune to Disorienting Fugue for 1 minute.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected and its temporary immunity to Disorienting Fugue increases to 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Confused] for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target is confused for 1 round and immediately attacks itself (in the normal fashion for attacking oneself while confused). This Strike doesn't give the creature a flat check to recover from the confusion.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Throw Song</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">R</span> (auditory, mental)</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within 30 feet attempts a melee Strike against you or an ally</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You let loose a staccato chirp from the pipes that appears to come from somewhere else. The triggering creature must attempt a @Check[will|dc:31|traits:auditory,mental] save. On a failure, the creature redirects the Strike to another creature of your choice within reach of the melee Strike. If no other creatures are within range, the affected creature instead takes a –2 penalty to the Strike.</p><hr /><p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> The initial raw materials must include the skin and vocal cords of a cauthooj.</p>"
