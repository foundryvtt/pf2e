Contents of the plate vary by chef and the intended palates, from the hearty sausages and hard cheese of charcuterie from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings to the hot-pepper cheese curds and smoked almonds of Thuvian platters. After Activating the charcuterie by eating it, you gain a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Make an Impression] and Perception checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sense Motive]. These bonuses last 24 hours or until you make your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Diplomat's Charcuterie]</p>"
