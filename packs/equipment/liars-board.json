            "value": "<p>This clockwork game board contains 6 hidden compartments that can be opened by moving the game pieces in specific, preset patterns. Each chamber has a unique combination, and only one chamber can be opened at a time. Once a chamber is opened, a new combination can be set as a 1‑minute activity. You can identify a Liar's Board as a clockwork device with a successful @Check[type:perception|dc:25] check, and you can find an individual hidden compartment with a successful @Check[type:perception|dc:30] check. The GM rolls a [[/r 1d6 #Discovered Chamber]]{d6} to determine which chamber is discovered, rolling again if the result is one you're already aware of. You can force open a compartment you've identified with a successful @Check[type:thievery|dc:30] check, but tampering will be obvious unless you critically succeed at the check. If you spend at least 1 hour examining the game board, you can instead attempt to deduce the correct combination to open a compartment with a successful @Check[type:society|dc:30] or @Check[type:games-lore|dc:30] check.</p>"
