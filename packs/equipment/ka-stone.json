The <em>ka stone</em> is an invested magic item that you automatically invest each day. It can't be removed without your permission, nor can it be dispelled, and you can never lose investiture in the ka stone. Its Bulk is negligible.</p>\n<p>The ka stone grants you a +1 item bonus to saves against death effects and negative effects, which increases to +2 at 8th level, +3 at 14th level, and +4 at 20th level.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (envision), or a different activation if otherwise specified</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> a number of times each day equal to the number of class feats you have from the Living Monolith archetype</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Enlarge] on yourself or use one of the other activated abilities granted by a later Living Monolith feat.</p>"
