The miniature is made from wood, pewter, or other simple materials, and features a rune etched into the underside of the replica's base. <em>Marvelous miniatures</em> sometimes come packaged together; for example, the camping set features the boat, campfire, and horse miniatures. Activating a <em>marvelous miniature</em> causes it to transform into another creature or object, which then can be used as normal for that object. Each miniature can be activated only once, with most of them permanently becoming the item in their description.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you use this miniature, a small wooden chest appears and immediately opens. This chest can hold up to 10 Bulk worth of items. Once the chest is closed, it transforms again—this time into a key—taking all of the stored items with it. You can activate this key by spending an Interact action to turn it in an imaginary lock, which causes it to transform back into a chest with all of the items still inside.</p>\n<p>Once it has turned into a chest a second time, it forever remains a wooden chest</p>"
