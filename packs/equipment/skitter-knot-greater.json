The knot then sprouts several roots that arch over your body like a spider's legs. These lift you a few inches off the ground before Striding and carrying you with them. The roots prioritize taking you away from obvious harm, though as a reaction, an ally who speaks Arboreal can command the roots to carry you to a particular point within range.</p>\n<p>After moving, the roots continue protecting you; this counts as Raising a Shield, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the beginning of your next turn. The roots use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Shield Block] reaction against the first physical attack against you, after which the roots crumble.</p>\n<p>The roots carry you up to 15 feet and have Hardness 10.</p>"
