These heralds use their trumpets to raise the alarm should intruders enter the Harrow Court (an event that won't happen in this adventure—but that shall in the next one!). The heralds know the formulas for all manner of magical instruments, including horns of blasting, horns of fog, and maestro's instruments, and can teach these formulas to the PCs.</p>",
