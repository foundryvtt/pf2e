The awakened silver gleams with altered celestial moonlight designed to weaken and expose devils and werecreatures. On a hit, it attempts to counteract any polymorph effect on the target. The counteract rank is 9, and the counteract modifier is [[/r 1d20+27 #Counteract]]{+27}. If you fail (but don't critically fail) the counteract check against a devil or a werecreature, you get a success instead. If you counteracted the Change Shape ability, the creature can't use that ability again for 1 round, or 1 minute on a critical success. If you hit a devil or werecreature not under a polymorph effect, the target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} for 1 minute instead.</p>"
