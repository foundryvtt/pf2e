            "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> A liar moves in to the village surrounding Harrowheart, but this shifty simulacrum has little interest in deceiving the PCs. In fact, they eagerly offer their aid in the deceptive arts. A character who visits the liar's home can take advantage of their expertise and tools&mdash; doing so grants a +2 item bonus to checks made to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Create Forgery]{Create Forgeries} or to assume a disguise with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Impersonate]. The liar also knows how to cast the uncommon spells <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Discern Lies]</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Honeyed Words]</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ring of Truth]</em>, and can teach these spells to PCs.</p>",

As long as you have <em>The Liar</em> invested, it grants you a +2 item bonus to Deception checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Lie]. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you're at least 17th level.

The weapon gains the backbiting curse. The curse lasts until you use this activation again. If you're at least 17th level, you can instead use this activation on a weapon within 30 feet. If the weapon is carried by a creature, it can resist the effect with a successful @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] save against your class DC or spell DC.</p>"
