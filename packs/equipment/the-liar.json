In fact, they eagerly offer their aid in the deceptive arts. A character who visits the liar's home can take advantage of their expertise and tools&mdash; doing so grants a +2 item bonus to checks made to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Create Forgery]{Create Forgeries} or to assume a disguise with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Impersonate]. The liar also knows how to cast the uncommon spells <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Discern Lies]</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Glibness]</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Zone of Truth]</em>, and can teach these spells to PCs.</p>",

As long as you have <em>The Liar</em> invested, it grants you a +2 item bonus to Deception checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Lie]. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you're at least 17th level.
