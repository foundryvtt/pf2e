If you activate this item with one action, you pour the sand into one or two @Template[line|distance:5]{5-foot squares} adjacent to you. If you activate this item with two actions, the sand spreads across a @Template[type:cone|distance:15]. The affected space turns into @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.hazards.Actor.Quicksand]. Creatures already in the area can Step out of the area as a reaction. The quicksand doesn't inflict lasting damage to most surfaces or nearby architecture, though a feature surrounded by the quicksand might sink or settle naturally. This terrain lasts for 1 day or until the effect is Dismissed, causing the sand to reappear in the jar.</p>"
