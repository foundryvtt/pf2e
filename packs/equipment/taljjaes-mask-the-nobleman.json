Each of Taljjae's masks is an 18th-level unique item with the invested and magical traits; if broken, they're automatically repaired to full HP when invested during daily preparations. The effect of a mask on a PC is noted in the mask's Understudy entry. Wearing one of Taljjae's masks also imposes Taljjae's jelly sense and jelly gluttony on the creature as long as it wears the mask.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span></p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per 10 minutes</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You hold out a hand and attempt to take something that doesn't belong to you.
