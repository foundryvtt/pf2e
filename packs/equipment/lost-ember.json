Once per day, from any distance, the entity that holds your <em>bargained contract</em> can take one of your memories. This functions as a casting of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Rewrite Memory] that doesn't grant you a saving throw and can't be reversed by any means without stealing the memory back first.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">F</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You start your turn @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Confused]</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> A speck of ash from the vial sealing your <em>bargained contract</em> appears out of nowhere on your tongue, bringing your senses into focus.
