Any time an action or effect would cause you to make a forced movement, roll a @Check[type:flat|dc:17] check. On a success, the forced movement fails to affect you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> command (magical, morph, transmutation)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You grow, gaining the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Enlarge]</em> for 1 minute. During that time, you gain dinosaur features; your legs and feet transform into a dinosaur's. You gain a foot unarmed attack that has the same statistics as your fist unarmed attack, except its damage die is increased from 1d4 to 1d6. Once during the duration, you can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.Trample] 3-action activity to Trample creatures one size smaller than you or smaller. This deals an amount of damage to each creature equal to that of your foot unarmed attack (including any extra weapon damage dice, bonuses, or additional damage as normal), with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:27|basic:true|name:Dinosaur Trample|traits:uncommon,invested,magical,transmutation|showDC:all] save. You can Dismiss the activation.</p>"
