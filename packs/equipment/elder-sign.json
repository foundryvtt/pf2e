There are only a limited number of elder signs, and each time one is destroyed, the universe's doom creeps inexorably closer. Reciting one of three different occult mantras (@Check[type:occultism|dc:20|name:Recite Occult Mantra] check to do so correctly) allows three different activations. All three abilities work only on a creature connected to the Elder Mythos or a cosmic horror, such as a wendigo or gug; the activations refer to them as \"eldritch creatures.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">D</span> command, envision, Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>elder sign</em> casts a 10th-rank banishment spell on an eldritch creature. Even if the creature isn't extraplanar, the <em>elder sign</em> can still banish it, sending it back to the part of the Material Plane from which it originated. If the creature is a Great Old One, the <em>elder sign</em> banishes it automatically (as if it critically failed its save) but is then forever destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">D</span> command, envision, Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>elder sign</em> casts dispel magic on an effect from an eldritch creature, using a counteract rank of 10 and +30 modifier for the roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">D</span> command, envision, Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>elder sign</em> casts dimensional lock, though it wards against travel by only eldritch creatures. Each time the <em>elder sign</em> casts <em>dimensional lock</em> in this way, the previous <em>dimensional lock</em> spell ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> The only way to destroy an <em>elder sign</em> is to use it to banish a Great Old One.</p>"
