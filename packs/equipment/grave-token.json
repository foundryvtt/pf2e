A @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Harm] spell that's empowered by this catalyst can reach faraway targets. If the harm spell is cast with 1 action, its range is 30 feet; if it's cast with 2 actions, its range is 60 feet. This has no effect on the three-action area version of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Harm], though in most cases, you don't have enough actions to Activate the token and cast a three-action @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Harm] anyway.</p>"
