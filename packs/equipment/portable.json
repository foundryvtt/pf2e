This wearable object has features that hint at the armor it hides. You aren't wearing the armor while it's in this form, but at the GM's discretion, you can still activate properties that might feasibly come from the wearable item the armor has become. If the armor is in its portable form, you can use this activation to revert it to armor, which you can don in 1 minute.</p>"
