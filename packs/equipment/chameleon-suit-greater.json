For 10 minutes, you can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Hide] without needing cover or concealment to do so. This doesn't allow you to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sneak] without ending your movement in cover or concealment, however, as the clockwork flips over and adjusts the scales to match your background as you move, giving the impression of rippling waves of color and revealing your movement. After the 10 minutes, the overworked clockwork and scales fall apart.</p>"
