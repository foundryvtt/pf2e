This effect lasts up to 2 hours.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Reflect Sound</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You take sonic damage from a spell or effect</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You use the <em>herald's ring</em> to reflect a portion of the sonic damage back at its source by attempting to counteract the effect. The ring has a counteract modifier of [[/r 1d20+23 #Counteract]]{+23}.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> All of the damage is reflected back on its source.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Half of the damage is reflected back at its source, and the other half is negated.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> Half of the damage is reflected back at the source, and you take the rest of the damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> None of the damage is reflected, but the herald's ring does absorb enough energy so that you can activate it again today.</p>"
