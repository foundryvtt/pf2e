The arms share your multiple attack penalty and attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Grapple] a random enemy within 15 feet of you. On a success, roll [[/r 1d4 #Added Effect]] to determine an additional effect of the arms, which lasts as long as the target remains @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Grabbed] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Restrained] by the arms. On subsequent turns, you can use a single action, which has the attack trait, to have the arms either Grapple a creature currently grappled or restrained (with no added effect) or release any creature they currently hold and repeat their initial effect. After 1 minute, the arms disappear and the potion's effects end.</p>\n<p>The Athletics modifier is [[/r 1d20+22 #Athletics]]{+22} and the Escape DC is 30.</p><table class=\"pf2e remaster\"><thead><tr><th>[[/r 1d4]]</th><th>Added Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>The arms cover the eyes; the target is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Blinded].</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>The arms cover the mouth; the target can't speak.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>The arms wrap around the limbs; the flat check for the target to use a manipulate action while grabbed is @Check[flat|dc:7] instead of DC 5.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>The arms crush your enemy; the target takes @Damage[13[bludgeoning]]{bludgeoning damage} equal to the potion's level immediately and at the end of each of its turns.</td></tr></tbody></table>"
