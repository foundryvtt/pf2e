First popularized by technicians in Absalom's Ivy Playhouse, they have spread throughout Golarion as an inexpensive way to add to the visual splendor of a show without relying on magic. When you activate a spark wafer, you bend the wafer, nearly snapping it in two, and then throw it at a corner of a square within 20 feet (all part of the same manipulate action). The wafer then releases a 10-foot-high column of sparks for 1 round. The sparks shed bright light in a @Template[type:burst|distance:5] and dim light in the next 5 feet. Any creature that begins their turn in the burst takes @Damage[1d4[fire]|options:area-damage] damage (@Check[reflex|dc:14|basic|options:area-effect] save).</p>"
