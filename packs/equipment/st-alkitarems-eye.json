At the center of the housing is a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Aeon Stone (Nourishing)]{Clear Spindle Aeon Stone}</em>, positioned so it resembles an open eye. This is necklace is known as <em>St. Alkitarem's Eye</em>. The housing can bear a single aeon stone in the same manner as a wayfinder, allowing the necklace's wearer to benefit from the aeon stone just as though it were orbiting their head. The necklace can bear only a <em>clear spindle aeon stone</em>, not other types of aeon stones. It allows the bearer to use the aeon stone's resonant power and doesn't restrict the wearer from investing other aeon stones (even those slotted in a wayfinder). <em>St. Alkitarem's Eye</em> otherwise has the same statistics (including Price) as a wayfinder.</p>"
