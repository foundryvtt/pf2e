A weapon anointed with this oil acts as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Bane] oil to elementals, but the damage type is the same as the target's greatest weakness if the target has weakness to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. If it has none of these, the additional damage is the same type as the weapon's damage type. These effects last 1 minute.</p>"
