            "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> When you epitomize <em>The Cyclone</em>, assign it to a point of interest in the mountains. This marks the location of a peak that is constantly assailed by blustery winds. Leering, sinister faces made of roiling vapor constantly form and melt away in these winds, and the feeling of the gusts tugging at clothing and flesh feels eerily like the clutching of long-fingered claws. A perpetual cyclone is visible at the mountain's peak. Nonetheless, any PC who visits this location feels a strong urge to attempt an ascent of the wind-wracked mountain. A PC who wishes to attempt the dangerous climb must spend 8 hours of downtime, then attempt a @Check[type:athletics|dc:35] check to Climb.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The PC reaches the mountain's peak! The PC gains the ability to cast a spell as a primal innate spell, choosing from <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Fly]</em> (once per day), <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Gust of Wind]</em> (at will), <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wall of Wind]</em> (three times per day), or <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Migration]</em> (once per day). In order to choose a spell, the spell's rank must be equal to or less than half the PC's level (rounded up). The spell is automatically heightened to half the PC's level, rounded up, and uses the PC's class DC if needed. A PC can change the innate spell they gain by successfully climbing the mountain again.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The PC makes progress, but hasn't quite reached the peak. The PC becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fatigued]. The PC can either abandon the attempt and end their eight hours back at the mountain's base, or they can continue the ascent either by sheltering in place for eight hours or attempting another eight hour activity at a Climb check to reach the peak. Successfully sheltering in place requires a @Check[type:survival|dc:35] checkâ€” success removes the fatigued condition, but failure does not, and also makes the PC @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} (or increases the value of a current enfeebled condition by 1, to a maximum of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 5}). A character who fails 3 Survival checks when attempting to shelter fails the attempt to ascend the mountain and is forced to retreat to the mountain's base (see Failure, below).</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The PC falls, taking @Damage[10d10[bludgeoning]] damage from falls and pummeling wind. The PC is fatigued.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the PC also suffers a fall near the end of their descent, taking an additional 50 points of falling damage along the way (@Damage[(10d10+50)[bludgeoning]]).</p>",
