While it's powered up, add the bottled lightning's item bonus to your Athletics checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Force Open], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.High Jump], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Long Jump], and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Shove]. The armor's Strength requirement is lowered by 1, or by 2 if the loaded bottled lightning's item bonus to attack rolls is +3 or higher. The armor's normal penalties still apply, based on this altered Strength. The activation uses up the bottled lightning, and the armor can't be activated again until a new one is installed.</p>"
