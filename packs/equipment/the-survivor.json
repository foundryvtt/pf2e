            "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> When you epitomize <em>The Survivor</em>, assign it to a point of interest in the lake, where a small island manifests. This island features a small hovel and a rickety wooden pier, beside which leans wooden post with a blank wooden sign. The island is inhabited by a single hermit who's taken a vow of silence. A PC can spend 8 hours describing to the hermit any coastal settlement of level 6 or lower or any noteworthy coastal fortress or landmark on Golarion by attempting a @Check[type:society|dc:30] check. With a success, the hermit nods eagerly at the end of the discussion and carves the name of that location onto the blank sign. From this point on, the PCs can use the Enter the Harrow Court activity here to open a one-way portal to that location. Switching to a new location requires another @Check[type:society|dc:30] check and familiarity with that location. A PC who Enters the Harrow Court can now choose to arrive in the demiplane at this point of interest rather than in Harrowheart's great hall.</p>",
