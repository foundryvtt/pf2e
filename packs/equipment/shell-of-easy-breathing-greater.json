The shell slowly fills with saltwater over the course of 1 minute. The shell's magic then becomes active, indicated by a steady stream of bubbles. Moving the shell disturbs its contents, causing the item to deactivate and the water inside to evaporate; otherwise, it remains activated for an unlimited duration. While the shell is activated, a creature can submerge its head and let water and bubbles fill its nose and mouth (or whatever body part it uses for breathing) as a 3-action activity. For the next 8 hours, the creature can breathe underwater. The creature is then temporarily immune to <em>shells of easy breathing</em> until the next time it makes its daily preparations.</p>"
