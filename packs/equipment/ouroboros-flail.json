The target must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:31|name:Ouroboros Flail Pull] save or be pulled adjacent to you. A creature pulled in is then @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Grabbed] by the flail until the end of your next turn unless you move, your target Escapes (DC 31), or you use the flail.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You extend the flail's chain, then wrap it across itself and strike two links together. This severs a usable 60-foot loop of chain from the flail, which instantly returns to its normal length. If you use this activation again, any previous chain you created with it disappears after 1 round. As with most obviously magical and temporary constructs, the chain cannot be sold.</p>"
