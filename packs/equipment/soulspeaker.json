The head is often that of a humanoid, but any creature capable of speaking in life can provide the grisly component needed for this magic item's creation. The head can contain a short message whispered to it and can then be commanded to repeat the message later. While a <em>soulspeaker</em> carries a message, the eyes of the shrunken head open, and they close as soon as its message is delivered.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Message]</em>, but instead of your message being transferred directly to a target's ears, the message is stored in the <em>soulspeaker</em>.
