When you activate the scale, it cracks open and releases a spray of caustic saltwater at the triggering creature. The creature takes @Damage[2d8[acid]] damage with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:24|basic:true] save. If the creature critically fails at its save, its concentration is brokenâ€”the triggering action is disrupted.</p>"
