While generally not used for combat outside of Song'o culture, some halflings have become so proficient as to make it just as effective as a blade in a fight. Many halflings will even sing to maintain a certain tempo and rhythm during combat. It deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. A fighting stick is a martial one-handed melee weapon in the club weapon group.</p>"
