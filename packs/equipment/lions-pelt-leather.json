The fur-lined pauldrons bear the insignia of a lion with a blade in its mouth. The type of blade indicates which bard school one graduated from. When you disguise the armor via its raiment rune, you can choose whether to conceal this symbol or not. You can also use the rune's activation to quickly display or hide the insignia.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Contact Ally</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (arcane, concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You cast message at 1st rank to a target that you know is also wearing a lion's pelt uniform.
