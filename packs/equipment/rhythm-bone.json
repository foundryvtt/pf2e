The bone's recording doesn't copy magical auditory effects, such as those of spellcasting, a harpy's song, or a banshee's wail. Once the rhythm bone has been activated in this way, it retains the recorded sound for the rest of its existence and can't be activated this way again.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The bone replays its recorded sounds.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> Supply a casting of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ghost Sound].</p>"
