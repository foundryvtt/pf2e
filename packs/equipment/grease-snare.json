The square with the snare, as well as three adjacent squares you determine when you set the snare, become difficult terrain when a creature triggers the snare. The triggering creature must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:22] saving throw. A creature can use three Interact actions to wipe away the grease from a single square or from the triggering creature; removing the grease from the triggering creature ends the effects on it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1} for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> For 1 minute, the creature is clumsy 1 and must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting a Thievery check. If the target rolls a failure at a Thievery check, it gets a critical failure instead. This is a misfortune effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the effects last for 1 hour instead of 1 minute, and removing the grease from the triggering creature requires a 1-minute activity instead of three Interact actions.</p>"
