A tiny Stasian coil is attached, which when activated runs a mixture of occult energy and high-voltage electricity through the wire. The design covers a @Template[type:burst|distance:5] when unfolded and must be unfolded into an area free of major obstructions such as rocks or hostile creatures. When a creature with the summoned trait attempts to enter the seal's area or make a melee Strike against a creature in that area, the summoned creature must attempt a @Check[will|dc:20] save.</p><hr /><p><strong>Success</strong> The action occurs normally, and the creature is immune to the effects of this portable seal this round.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The movement or Strike is disrupted, but the creature is immune to further effects of the portable seal this round.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The movement or Strike is disrupted.</p>"
