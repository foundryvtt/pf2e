Anyone inspecting a document notices the disguise with a successful @Check[type:perception|dc:20|name:Determine Documents are Misleading|showDC:all] check, but determining the actual text requires a successful @Check[type:society|dc:20|name:Decipher Writing|traits:action:decipher-writing|showDC:all] check to Decipher Writing. This lasts until you use this activation again, which ends the effect for all previously disguised documents; until you use the second activation to end the effect for a single document; or until a document in the haversack remains outside the haversack for at least 1 hour, ending the effect for that document.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> command</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You revert one of the documents back to its original state.</p>"
