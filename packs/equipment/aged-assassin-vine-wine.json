Alchemical reagents added during fermentation concentrate the vine's connection to its environment and impart them onto the imbiber.

When you drink the wine, vegetation in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:20] around you begins to writhe, becoming difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.</p>"
