After you eat the soup, it attempts to counteract (counteract [[/r {1d20+6} #Counteract Check]]{+6}) @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied] conditions affecting you; if successful, it reduces the value of your stupefied condition by 1 (or by 2 on a critical success). After eating a serving of moon radish soup, you gain temporary immunity to its effects for 24 hours.</p>"
