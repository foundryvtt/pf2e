Creatures that are in the haze or later enter it are wreathed in wisps of smoke; these wisps last while the creature is in the smoke's aura and until the start of its next turn if it leaves the haze. An ally in the aura is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] and gains a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks. Any enemy in the aura that is or becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Invisible] appears as a translucent shape to you and your allies—it's no longer @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden], but it remains concealed.</p>"
