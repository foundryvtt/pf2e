            "value": "<p>A swazzle is a device made of two strips of metal bound with sinew and around a reed that, when held to the mouth, causes the user's voice to take on a distinctive rasping tone. Swazzles are often used by street puppeteers to give their puppets' voices a unique and memorable timber. A mocker's swazzle, though, has a different use—rather than simply giving voices to troublemaking puppets, it helps a performer fight back against hecklers in a crowd.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Heckle the Heckler</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> (auditory, emotion, linguistic, manipulate, mental)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within 30 feet of you attempts and fails to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Demoralize] you</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You quickly fire a retort back at the triggering creature, mocking its failed attempt in a way that makes it laugh at its own ineptitude; you cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Laughing Fit] (@Check[will|dc:30] save) on the triggering creature.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Mocking Spell</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (auditory, linguistic, spellshape)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You direct a quick bit of insulting mockery at a creature who can understand you that's within earshot.
