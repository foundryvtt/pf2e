            "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> When you epitomize <em>The Carnival</em>, assign it to a point of interest in the Harrow Court's farmland area. This marks the location of a colorful, vibrant, and slightly off-putting fairground where festivals and celebrations are in constant swing. The simulacra who inhabit this carnival never leave and tend to subtly draw appearances and themes from potential foes the PC may face in their future. Once per week, a character can spend 8 hours at the fairground simply observing its participants&mdash;those who do can attempt a @Check[type:perception|dc:28] check.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The PC observes some of the carnival performers and gains subtle clues as to the nature of a foe they will soon face. The GM chooses a specific, named enemy that the PCs are likely to face at some point in the current adventure they're playing. When the PC encounters that foe (as long as the foe isn't disguised), they automatically recognize them. At this point, the GM informs the PC that they recognize the foe from their visit to the carnival, and the PC learns information about the foe as if they had achieved a critical success in an attempt to Recall Knowledge against that target. Until the party encounters and defeats that foe, they cannot visit this carnival again to search for clues.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As success, but instead of granting insight into the nature of a specific foe, the GM chooses a generic monster that the PCs may soon face, selecting from standard monsters that might be encountered in the current adventure the PCs are playing. The information gained is equal to what the PC would have gained from a success by Recalling Knowledge about that monster.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> Apart from a vaguely unsettling feeling of being watched themselves, the PC learns nothing from their visit to the carnival.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Rather than noticing anything helpful, the PC emerges from their trip to the carnival with paranoid feelings of being watched by unseen eyes, and becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 3}.</p>",
            "value": "<p><strong>Suit</strong> Star (Wis)</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong> chaotic neutral</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>The Carnival</em> represents false dreams. When you have <em>The Carnival</em> invested, your flat check DCs to obtain reliable information from divination effects (such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Augury]</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Read Fate]</em>, or the activation of this card) are reduced by 2 (but not to less than 2). Casting a divination effect with a flat check, whether or not the flat check succeeds, gives a series of subtly different visions that don't confuse the meaning but make you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 round. If you're at least 17th level, the flat check is instead reduced by 3.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (divination, prediction) envision</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You peer into the future and witness yourself walking through a colorful but vaguely sinister carnival, meeting a variety of strange people. One of these people looks more genuine than the others and resembles someone you're likely to meet for the first time in the next 24 hours (if anyone). This resemblance might be metaphorical, such a clown signifying someone who is silly or a stilt-walker representing someone who is tall. You also get a sense for whether this person can be trusted, should be distrusted, or neither, based on how they're most likely to interact with you and your allies. The GM decides who this new person might be, then rolls a secret @Check[type:flat|dc:6]. On a failure, the result is always \"neither,\" making it hard to determine whether a \"neither\" result is accurate.</p>"
