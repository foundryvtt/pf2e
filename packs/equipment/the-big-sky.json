            "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> When you epitomize <em>The Big Sky</em>, assign it to a point of interest in the Harrow Court's desert area. This marks the location of a sprawling expanse of sand that's been melted into a field of reflective glass that mirrors the sky above. The temperature here during the day is extreme heat&mdash;every 10 minutes, a creature in the region takes [[/r 2d6[fire]]] damage. At night, the reverse holds true; the temperate here becomes extremely cold and inflicts [[/r 2d6[cold]]] damage every 10 minutes. More astonishingly, this region has a supernatural ability to help a creature use their raw strength to break free from curses they're suffering from. Once per day, a character can spend an hour meditating here, enduring either the extreme heat or cold, but at the end of that hour, the character can select one curse that they're currently afflicted by, then attempt an Athletics check against the curse's DC.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The curse is counteracted.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The curse is counteracted as long as its level is equal to or less than the character's level.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The curse is counteracted as long as its level is equal to or less than the character's level &ndash; 4.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The curse is not removed, and the character overextends themselves in the attempt, becoming @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 3}.</p>",
