If you begin your turn with a dying value of 3 or greater, instead of making your recovery check, you lose the dying condition but remain unconscious at 0 Hit Points. The mask then cracks in half and is destroyed. The psychopomps won't be so easily fooled again-you are temporarily immune to the effects of any psychopomp mask for 1 year.</p>"
