            "value": "<p>This surprisingly sturdy 3-foot-by-3-foot clay tile resembles a thick pressure plate. It can support up to 500 pounds of weight atop it before it is destroyed. The<em>floorbell's</em>nature is obvious at a glance, but mundane or magical means can obscure or camouflage the tile (such as by covering it in scattered leaves or by casting an <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Illusory Object]</em> spell) to make it harder to detect.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span>command, Interact;<strong>Effect</strong> The<em>floorbell</em>must be activated on level ground. When you do, specify the amount of weight that triggers the<em>floorbell's</em>alarm system. When the amount of weight you specify (or more) is placed on the<em>floorbell</em>, it emits an ear-piercing wail clearly audible to a range of 150 feet. A<em>floorbell</em>can also ring an alarm if a weight you specify is removed from the<em>floorbell</em>, such as if you activated it while a heavy sack was on it.</p>"
