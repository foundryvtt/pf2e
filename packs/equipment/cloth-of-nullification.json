The cloth's counteract check modifier is [[/r 1d20+32 #Counteract]]{+32}, and its counteract rank is 10. Regardless of the result, the cloth of nullification can't be activated again for [[/br 2d6 #hours]]{2d6 hours}. On a success, the effect or item is deactivated for the same amount of time, and its duration, if any, continues to expire during that time. With a successful counteract check, you can instead choose to completely absorb the magic from the effect or item into the cloth of nullification. If you do, both become completely non-magical and their magic can't be recovered, even by the remake spell.</p>\n<p>The cloth of nullification automatically fails to counteract most artifacts and similarly powerful items</p>"
