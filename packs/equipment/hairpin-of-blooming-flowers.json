You become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] for 1 minute or until you move from your current location. Any creature within the @Template[type:burst|distance:10] when you Activate the Item must succeed at a @Check[type:reflex|dc:23] save or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] until the end of its next turn (or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Blinded] until the end of its next turn on a critical failure). The flower blooms again the next day.</p>"
