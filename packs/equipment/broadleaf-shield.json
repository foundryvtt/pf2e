            "value": "<p>Though it resembles an enormous leaf freshly plucked from a tree, a <em>broadleaf shield</em> is extremely durable. It also regrows rapidly, fully repairing itself when broken if it's left in sunlight for 10 consecutive minutes.</p>\n<p>At each dawn, the leaf transforms to an appearance appropriate for the season. While you're wielding the shield, you gain resistance 3 to a damage type depending on the shield's color. This resistance doubles while you have the shield raised.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pink</strong> (void resistance) In spring, the leaf is a delicate blossom-like pink and exudes the energy of life.</li>\n<li><strong>Green</strong> (fire resistance) In summer, the leaf is a deep, rich green with a waxy coating.</li>\n<li><strong>Orange</strong> (poison resistance) In autumn, the leaf turns orange, red, or yellow and dehydrates slightly.</li>\n<li><strong>Brown</strong> (cold resistance) In winter, the leaf turns dead, dry, and brown.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate - Change Season</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The shield transforms as though living through seasons in a moment, becoming the color of your choice for 5 minutes.</p>"
