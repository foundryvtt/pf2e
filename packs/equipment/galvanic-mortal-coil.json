            "value": "<p>This porous steel coil wraps around a shard of onyx, supplementing the closely guarded science of galvaspheres with the magic of necromancy. When embedded in a body comprised of flesh, the blood and other fluids catalyze electrical pulses within the coil, activating the necromantic energies. In living creatures, this causes a dangerous surge that can damage the heart. In corpses, however, this can create a limited window of reanimation, with access to the corpse's final memories.<em> Galvanic mortal coils</em> are even rarer than other galvaspheres, and thought by most to be merely hypothetical.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You drive the coil into a living creature that has 0 HP while attaching the other end to yourself, in order to damage their heart and possibly siphon their life force.
