A typical standard comes with a stand or pole to hold it aloft. You can instead spend 2 consecutive Interact actions to mount a knight's standard on a two-handed polearm or spear weapon; the standard is visible as long as you wield the weapon with two hands. Some individuals are inspired by the sight of a standard or demoralized by the destruction of one.</p>"
