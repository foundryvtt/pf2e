It can burrow through solid stone, but if it does so it burrows 40 feet instead of 80 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Eat</strong> The worm attempts to swallow a creature, crush it in its insides, then spit the creature out. The target must be within 15 feet, and it attempts a @Check[type:reflex|dc:30] save. If it fails, it takes @Damage[(3d6+9)[bludgeoning]] (doubled on a critical failure). The worm then spits the creature out to any empty space on the ground within 30 feet, causing the creature to take damage from a 20-foot fall.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> Supply the corpse of a purple worm.</p>"
