Pulling the ripcord causes a small, pressurized air tank to instantly inflate the bladder to the size of a rowboat, forcing up to 16 Bulk of attached items or creatures to jet to the surface of the water at a rate of 60 feet per round. Pulling the ripcord, or removing or affixing something to one of the many tethers on the recovery bladder, takes an Interact action. A recovery bladder can only be used once, as the quick inflation permanently stretches the bladder, and only a few tinkerers have the skills and equipment to refill a pressurized air tank.</p>"
