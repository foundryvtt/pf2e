            "value": "<p>Folklore from near the Forest of Spirits tells of the origin of the <em>poracha fulu</em>. Once, a traveler saved an eight-legged feline who turned out to be a poracha prince. In return, the prince gave the traveler a fulu that later prevented a fast-acting poison from slaying them. Traditionally, one wears a string of up to nine <em>poracha fulus</em>, which counts as one talisman. Each time you take persistent damage, one <em>poracha fulu</em> affixed to you negates the damage and crumbles to dust. This response is automatic, but you can use a free action (envision) to prevent your fulus from responding. If you do, any <em>poracha fulus</em> affixed to you never respond to that persistent damage.</p>"
