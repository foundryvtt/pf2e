While merged, you can't move, you can see through the water if it's clear enough, and you can hear what's going on outside of the water. Water typically can't take damage, but if the water you're merged in is subject to electricity damage or an ability or effect that destroys or dries water, you're expelled from the water and take @Damage[10d6] damage. <em>Control water</em> expels you without dealing damage.</p>"
