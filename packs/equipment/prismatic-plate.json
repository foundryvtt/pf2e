            "value": "<p>With its standard-grade mithral polished to a mirrorlike sheen, this <em>+2 resilient glamered mithral breastplate</em> features the religious symbols of the goddesses of the Prismatic Ray pantheon-Desna, Sarenrae, and Shelyn-surrounded by a rainbow-colored set of gems.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">D</span> command, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You surround yourself in a coruscating field of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet light for 1 minute. Each color has a different effect, based on the effects of a 7th-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Chromatic Wall]</em> spell, and you apply the effects of each color once before it disappears from your field of light, which can happen in the following two ways.</p>\n<p>First, the field attempts a counteract check (counteract level 7, counteract modifier [[/r 1d20+27 #Counteract]]{+27}) against any effect that would be blocked by a chromatic wall of any of the colors still surrounding you in your field of light. Succeed or fail, that color then disappears from your field of light.</p>\n<p>Second, any creature that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon is affected by a random remaining color from your field. As normal, this doesn't affect creatures you choose to touch.</p>\n<p>A creature can also remove a color from your field of light by using a specific spell, as described in <em>chromatic wall</em>. The effect ends early if each color disappears from your field of light, or if you choose to Dismiss it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> The initial raw materials must include 1,600 gp of mithral.</p>"
