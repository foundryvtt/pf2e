            "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> When you epitomize <em>The Demon's Lantern</em>, assign it to a point of interest in the swamp. This indicates a region that has become infested with will-o'-wisps. A PC who travels here must wait until nightfall for the wisps to come out. At this point, they can spend 8 hours of the night pursuing the will-o'-wisps through the overgrown swamp by attempting a @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:35] check, after which no one may chase the wisps again for 1 week.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You catch up to the will-o'-wisps. The wisps are startled and vanish in a panic, leaving behind a treasure for you to claim. Choose from among the following: antimagic armor rune, greater shock weapon rune, a wand of continuation (blink, heightened to 6th level), or a wand of regenerate. At the GM's discretion, other 15th-level permanent magic items could be included in this list. The wisps now know that you can catch them and avoid you—you can never attempt this activity again.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You come close enough to a wisp to hear its delighted giggles at being chased but fail to catch up to it. The next time you perform this activity, you gain a +4 circumstance check on your Acrobatics check.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to catch up to the wisps.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You become entangled. The wisps descend upon you and drain away some of your health before they flit away, giggling cruelly as they go. You become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 3} for 1 week or until the condition is removed via an effect like restoration.</p>",
