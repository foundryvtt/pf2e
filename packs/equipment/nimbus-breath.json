After harvesting the cloud, the bottle must sit at the peak of the tallest mountain for 10 days and 10 nights, pelted by all forms of weather. <em>Nimbus breaths</em> can also be created by capturing clouds on other planes, such as those found on the Plane of Air or in the highest peaks of Celestia.</p>\n<p>After you inhale the <em>nimbus breath</em>, you gain resistance 5 to electricity and are affected by @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Fly] as long as you hold your breath.</p>\n<p>You can exhale the breath as a single action to create a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Gust of Wind] (DC 24) from your mouth. If you're airborne when the cloud expires, you float gently to the ground at 60 feet per round and don't take damage from this fall.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Nimbus Breath]</p>"
