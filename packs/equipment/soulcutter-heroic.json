            "gm": "<p><em>Soulbreaker</em> is focused on Kyonin's safety and protection. It imparts the following edicts and anathema on the wielder. If they're violated, the artifact reverts to its non-artifact form until the wielder atones, either through the use of the atone ritual, or through a short side quest or influence encounter of your own design.</p><p><strong>Edicts</strong> kill Treerazer, protect elven lives, push back Tanglebriar's boundaries</p><p><strong>Anathema</strong> aid Treerazer, willingly betray Kyonin</p><h2>Choose Apex Attribute</h2><p><em>Soulbreaker</em> is a powerful apex item, but the apex bonuses granted are more powerful than most. As with all apex items, a PC can only benefit from one apex item at a time. When your character creates the artifact, choose one attribute modifier. When you invest the artifact, you either increase that attribute modifier by 2 or increase it to +5, whichever would give you a higher value. Once you make this selection, you can't change it later.</p><hr /><p><em>Note: Select the apex attribute on the details tab of this item.</em></p><h2>Choose Heroic Skill</h2><p><em>Soulbreaker</em> also bolsters one skill of your choice. When your character creates the artifact, choose one of the three skills listed for the artifact. As long as the artifact is invested by you, it grants you a +4 item bonus to checks with that skill.</p><h2>Heroic Recovery</h2><p>Finally, <em>Soulbreaker</em> has 1 Recovery Point; this point replenishes once per day when its invested partner does their daily preparations. When the artifact's partner's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dying] value would reach an amount sufficient to kill them (usually 4), the artifact spends its Recovery Point, and the partner instead increases their @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed] value by 1 and stabilizes at 0 Hit Points.</p><h2>Invested Weapon</h2><p>Note that normally staves and weapons don't need to be invested, but <em>Soulbreaker</em> is an exception to this rule. It provides its constant benefits as long as the item remains invested and is carried or stowed by a character; they need not be held in a hand or wielded as a weapon in combat in order to grant these benefits. If you drop an invested staff or weapon, are disarmed of it, or otherwise release it from being held or stowed, you continue to benefit from its invested qualities until the end of your next turn—if you reclaim the staff or weapon before the end of your next turn, then your investment continues uninterrupted. If you fail to reclaim the item by this point, it's no longer invested until you repeat the process by Interacting with the item, taking the normal steps to invest the item.</p>",
