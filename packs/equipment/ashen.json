Ashen weapons are typically coated in a thin layer of ash that gradually returns over the span of a day, even after wiping away. A creature hit by an attack from an ashen weapon becomes surrounded by burning ash, which deals @Damage[1d4[persistent,fire]] damage. This ash clouds the senses, causing the creature to become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Confused] for 1 round unless it succeeds at a @Check[type:will|dc:25] save.</p>"
