This mouth can accommodate most crystal balls. A crystal ball placed within the mouth is enhanced&mdash; its save DC increases by 1, its <em>scrying</em> activation can be activated three times per day instead of twice per day, and its effects can extend beyond the planar borders of the Harrow Court to target creatures on Golarion.</p>",
