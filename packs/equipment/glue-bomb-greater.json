When you hit a creature with a glue bomb, that creature takes a –15-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute. You gain a +2 item bonus to attack rolls, and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] DC is 28.</p>\n<p>On a critical hit, a creature in contact with a solid surface becomes stuck to the surface and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] for 1 round, and a creature flying via wings has its wings tangled, causing it to fall safely to the ground and become unable to Fly again for 1 round. Glue bombs are not effective when used on a creature that is in water.</p>\n<p>The target can end any effects by Escaping or spending a total of 3 Interact actions to carefully remove the sticky substances. These Interact actions don't have to be consecutive, and other creatures can provide the actions as well.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Glue Bomb (Greater)]</p>"
