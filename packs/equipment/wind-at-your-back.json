You must all remain within 100 feet to get the benefit. If you activate the item aboard a vehicle, you instead grant the vehicle a +10-foot circumstance bonus to its Speeds for 8 hours. If the vehicle is powered by wind, such as a sailing ship, the bonus increases to +20 feet. When the 8 hours are up, the cloud stops blowing and floats back into your hands.</p>"
