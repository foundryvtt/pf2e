By meeting with the attendees at your events, you can use Performance instead of Diplomacy to Gather Information. When you would use Performance to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Earn Income], you don't earn any gold pieces, as the money disappears before you can even count it.</p>\n<p>The entity that holds your <em>bargained contract</em> can influence your reception any time you perform for a crowd or Activate the pocket. If they influence your performance favorably, you gain a +2 item bonus to your Performance check. If they influence your performance unfavorably, you gain a -2 item penalty to your Performance check. If you've failed to earn the entity money in quite a while, it typically influences your performance unfavorably.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> command, envision</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You exercise all of your charm on a creature, turning a chance meeting into an impromptu performance that commands attention. Attempt a single @Check[type:performance|defense:perception] check against the Perception DC of the creature. On a success, the creature is affected as though by a successful Deception check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Create a Diversion]. The entity that holds your contract can influence this performance as well.</p>"
