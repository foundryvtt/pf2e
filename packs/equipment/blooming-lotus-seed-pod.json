Each lotus pad has a 10- foot radius and can support 1 Large creature, 2 Medium creatures, or 4 Small creatures.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate - Blooming Flower</strong> 10 minutes (manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You plant the blooming lotus seed pod in the ground and a giant lotus flower blooms in that square. Over the next 8 hours, creatures who sleep for at least 6 hours within 30 feet of the lotus flower gain the benefits of long-term rest as though they'd spent an entire day and night resting, and all creatures within the affected area are immune to the effects of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Nightmare] spell and other magical effects that affect only sleeping creatures.</p>"
