When an activated magnetic shield is raised, the circumstance bonus increases by 1 against attacks made with weapons primarily made of metal. If you use a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Shield Block] against a creature attacking you with such a weapon, you also gain a +1 item bonus to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Disarm] attempts against that weapon until the end of your next turn. The activation uses up the <em>bottled lightning</em>, and the shield can't be activated again until a new one is installed.</p>"
