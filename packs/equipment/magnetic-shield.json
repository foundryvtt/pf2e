Twin electrical probes near the grip can socket into a jar of moderate (or higher leveled) @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Bottled Lightning (Lesser)]{Bottled Lightning}, which takes 3 Interact actions to install.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> A bottled lightning is installed in the shield</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> The shield becomes an electromagnet for 3 rounds. When an activated magnetic shield is raised, the circumstance bonus increases by 1 against attacks made with weapons primarily made of metal. If you use a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Shield Block] against a creature attacking you with such a weapon, you also gain a +1 item bonus to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Disarm] attempts against that weapon until the end of your next turn. The activation uses up the bottled lightning, and the shield can't be activated again until a new one is installed.</p>"
