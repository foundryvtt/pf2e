            "value": "<p>A <em>major breath blaster</em> is a <em>+3 major striking blunderbuss</em> most commonly crafted from the trachea of a dragon, though other creatures with breath weapons or the ability to spit energy are occasionally used. The implementation of the dragon's trachea allows the firearm to unleash a torrent of pure energy in the form of gouts of flame or bolts of electricity.</p>\n<p>A <em>breath blaster's</em> Strikes deal either acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage, depending on the dragon type or other creature from which it was made, though it can otherwise be used like a normal blunderbuss. A breath blaster also can be activated to fire a line of energy in a @Template[type:line|distance:30] or @Template[type:cone|distance:15], chosen when it's created and typically corresponding to the shape of the breath weapon used by the type of dragon or creature from which the <em>breath blaster was created.</em></p>\n<p>In theory, the foundational techniques required to create a breath blaster would allow for other damage types, but such breath blasters would require the trachea from the correct dragon or creature type and additional creation techniques, making such a breath blaster rare rather than uncommon.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> Interact (evocation, magical)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You fire the <em>breath blaster</em>, dealing [[/r 10d6]] damage of the appropriate type in the appropriate area.
