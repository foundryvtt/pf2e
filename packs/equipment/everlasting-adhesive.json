A single flask covers an area up to 1 square foot and must be used all at once to form a single bond between two surfaces. If the activation is interrupted, the bond fails, and the adhesive is wasted.</p>\n<p>Once two surfaces are joined with everlasting adhesive, a creature can separate them only with a successful @Check[type:athletics|dc:50] check. The adhered objects tend to break before the adhesive does unless they're particularly durable, though a creature determined to separate the objects can break off the parts connected by the everlasting adhesive and later Repair the objects.</p>\n<p>The adhesive can affect creatures only if they're willing, and its bond can be broken by exfoliating the outermost layer of skin.</p>"
