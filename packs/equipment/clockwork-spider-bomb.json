When you activate the spider bomb, you place it on the ground and the clockwork spider crawls 5 feet in a straight line, continuing to advance 5 feet in the same straight line at the end of each of your turns for the next 4 rounds (traveling a total of 25 feet). If it takes any damage during this time, its bulbous abdomen detonates in a raging flame, dealing @Damage[5d6[fire]] damage to all creatures in a @Template[type:burst|distance:5] (@Check[type:reflex|dc:24|basic:true|name:Clockwork Spider Bomb Explosion|traits:fire|showDC:all]). You can also activate it a second time with a single-action command word activation, causing it to explode. The spider bomb has an AC of 10, 5 Hit Points, and +0 to all saving throws. After it detonates, the spider bomb is completely destroyed, regardless of the effects of its detonation. If it survives to the end of the 4-round duration without being detonated, the spider harmlessly loses its explosive charge and falls apart.</p>"
