When activated, it creates an invisible construct of magical force that attaches to the weapon and automatically stabilizes it in any location, even in midair. The effect lasts for 1 minute or until you Dismiss it. The effect also ends immediately if you let go of the affixed weapon. The affixed weapon cannot be moved while this effect is active.</p>"
