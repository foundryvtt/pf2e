When you do, <em>acid grip</em> loses the acid trait, gains the fungus trait, and all acid damage the spell deals becomes void damage. On a hit, the target additionally gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1} conditions as the spores consume their flesh. As long as the target is taking persistent void damage, they can't reduce the value of their sickened condition below 1.</p>"
