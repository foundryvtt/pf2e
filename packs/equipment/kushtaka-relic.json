Used as a catalyst for @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Spirit Blast] against a target possessing another creature, a <em>kushtaka relic</em> attempts to banish such a spirit. A creature who fails the Fortitude save against <em>spirit blast</em> has its grasp on its possessed target weakened. The result of the possessed creature's next Will save against the possession effect is improved by one degree. A creature who is possessing another and critically fails the Fortitude save against <em>spirit blast</em> takes damage and then is banished from the body it was possessing.</p>"
