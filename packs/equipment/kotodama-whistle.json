During this time, the object attempts to answer your questions to the best of its ability but can provide an answer of only \"yes\" or \"no.\" In most cases, an object has knowledge only of events it was personally present for and has no particular knowledge skills to interpret the events it has seen. If the object can't answer a question with a simple yes or no answer, it stays silent.</p>"
