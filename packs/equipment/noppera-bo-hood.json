When you wear this hood and invest it, it merges with your head and face, becoming imperceptible as a worn item except on close examination, which reveals a slight oily sheen to your facial features. You can cause minor shifts and changes to your features while wearing a <em>noppera-bo hood</em>; this counts as having a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Disguise Kit] to Impersonate any creature that is the same ancestry as you.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> envision (transmutation)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You focus on the hood's magic, and then gain the effects of 1st-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Illusory Disguise], though it's a transmutation effect rather than an illusion.</p>"
