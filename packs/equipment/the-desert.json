A strange magic in this region allows a willing character to turn themselves over to the desert to have their body be consumed and then reborn into something new. This eight hour period of meditation and introspection is dangerousâ€”the PC must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:35] saving throw.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Your body transforms into a new adult body of an ancestry of your choice, subject to GM approval. Replace your ancestry Hit Points, size, Speeds, ability boosts, ability flaws, traits, and special abilities with those of the new ancestry. You lose your heritage and ancestry feats, and must select replacements from the new ancestry. Your background, class features, and known languages remain unaltered. You can never again benefit from The Desert in this way.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, except the process leaves you feeling awkward in your new body, leaving you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 2}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 2}, and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 2} for 1 week; these conditions can't be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to be remade and instead are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fatigued].</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Not only do you fail to be remade, you become fatigued and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 3}. You cannot attempt to be remade in the desert again for 1 month.</p>",

As long as <em>The Desert</em> is invested, you are immune to the effects of temperatures ranging from extreme cold to extreme heat, and can hold your breath and go without food and water for twice as long as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> envision, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You wave the card in the air to create desert winds that blast sand so scouring it strips flesh from bone. The sand created by this effect vanishes an instant later, but the effects on those caught in the area linger. Creatures in a @Template[type:cone|distance:60] take @Damage[7d6[piercing],7d6[fire]]{7d6 piercing damage and 7d6 fire damage} (with a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)|basic:true] save equal to your class DC or spell DC). A creature who fails this save also becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fatigued] and enfeebled for 1 minute, and a creature who critically fails this save becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 2} for 1 minute and fatigued until they get a night's rest (or the fatigue is removed by other means). The damage increases to @Damage[8d6[piercing],8d6[fire]]{8d6 piercing damage and 8d6 fire} if you're at least 15th level, to @Damage[9d6[piercing],9d6[fire]]{9d6 piercing damage and 9d6 fire} if you're at least 17th level, and to @Damage[10d6[piercing],10d6[fire]]{10d6 piercing damage and 10d6 fire} if you're at least 19th level.</p>"
