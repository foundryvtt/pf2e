They are often used to signal others to the beacon's location, to coordinate assaults, to request rescue, or for other similar reasons. Higher-level beacons have a radius so large that they can be seen from miles away at night. When you Activate a flare beacon, you can either place it on the ground in a space within your reach or toss it up to 60 feet straight up. A flare beacon in the air falls at a rate of 10 feet per round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The beacon shines bright light in a 180-foot radius and dim light in the next 180 feet. Creatures within a 30-foot radius of the beacon must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:35|name:Fortitude|traits:dazzle] save or be dazzled until they are no longer within 30 feet of it. Additionally, on a critical failure, they are also blinded for 1 round.</p>"
