The plague mask attempts to counteract any inhaled poisons or airborne diseases each round you breathe. The same replacement filters used in @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Water Purifier]{Water Purifiers} can be used with a plague mask, granting you the counteract modifier and effects of the filter for 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>Plague masks are uncommon items because the filters they use to protect from inhaled poisons and diseases are themselves uncommon. As such, you can buy a plague mask without a filter as a common item, though it's usually more cost-effective to buy a fine mask in the shape of a plague mask in that case.</p>"
