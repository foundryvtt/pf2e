You can activate this vial by throwing it as a Strike. It's a simple thrown ranged weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the manipulate trait to the attack made with it. On a hit against an undead, <em>life salt</em> deals 1 persistent vitality damage, and the undead must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:20] or be unable to attack you as long as it continues taking the persistent vitality damage. If you use a hostile action against any undead, this second effect ends, and the undead can attack you normally.</p>"
