            "value": "<p>This dried, gnarled hand is clenched in a fist, waiting for a creature to pick it up. When you pick up the <em>monkey's paw</em>, the hand opens, revealing three withered fingers. The <em>monkey's paw</em> grants you three wishes (with the effects of a success on the <em>wish</em> ritual), curling one finger after every one. Once you pick up the <em>monkey's paw</em>, you cannot discard the hand until it returns to a clenched fist by granting its three wishes. Any attempts to discard the hand, even with the effects of a <em>wish</em> ritual, are unsuccessful as the <em>monkey's paw</em> reappears among your possessions within [[/br 1d4 #hours]]{1d4 hours}; it doesn't work for any other creature in the intervening time. The hand returns even if another creature steals it from you. Once you make all three wishes, the <em>monkey's paw</em> uses @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Interplanar Teleport] to travel to a random point in the multiverse.</p>\n<p>Whenever the <em>monkey's paw</em> hears you utter a statement that sounds like a wish, even if you don't use the words \"I wish,\" it activates and grants a twisted, horrifying version of your wish, producing any effect within the possibility of <em>wish</em> ritual, and potentially a greater effect at the GM's discretion.</p>"
