You must first spend an Interact action preparing the oil, then throw it with another action as a ranged attack. If you hit, it splatters on the creature or in a single 5-foot square you target. You must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:10] for the oil to ignite successfully when it hits. If the oil ignites, the target takes @Damage[1d6[fire]] damage.</p>"
