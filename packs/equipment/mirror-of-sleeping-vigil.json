While invested, you can watch over your sleeping body from the Dreamlands, letting you see your own body and a @Template[type:emanation|distance:5] around you, though you can't hear, smell, or use other senses from your dreaming self. You do not take the -4 status penalty to visual Perception checks in that area or gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Blinded] condition from being @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious] against creatures in that area. As long as you fell asleep voluntarily and not from a sleep effect, you can automatically wake up from sleep if there is visible activity around you.</p>"
