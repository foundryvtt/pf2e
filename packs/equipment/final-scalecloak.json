Any kaiju within a 5-mile radius of the <em>Final Scalecloak</em> can sense the presence and nature of the item, and can also determine whether it's being worn by a mortal. This sense grows stronger as the item and kaiju near one another, until the kaiju can pinpoint exactly where the cloak is and who currently possesses it.</p>\n<p>When worn, the <em>Final Scalecloak</em> grants you resistance 15 to physical and precision damage, immunity to electricity, and a Fly speed of 60 feet. You are unaffected by strong winds while flying.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Commune with Kaiju</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate, manipulate, primal)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Spend a Mythic Point; you gain the effects of a 6th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Telepathy] spell but can use it only to communicate with Gargantuan animals and beasts. Most kaiju are hostile toward you for wearing the <em>Final Scalecloak</em>, however, requiring great effort to calm them enough to have a conversation.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Embody the Storm</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate, manipulate, primal)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Spend a Mythic Point; a nimbus of crackling electricity surrounds you for 1 minute. You gain a +4 status bonus to AC against ranged projectiles that are at least partly made of metal. If a foe attempts to Strike you with an unarmed attack or melee attack with a weapon at least partly made of metal, that creature takes @Damage[3d10[electricity]] damage (@Check[reflex|dc:40|basic|traits:concentrate,manipulate,primal] save).</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Embody the Storm]</p><hr /><p><strong>Destruction</strong> The <em>Final Scalecloak</em> is torn to shreds if the wearer is struck by an attack or effect from both Agyra and Mogaru within the same round.</p>"
