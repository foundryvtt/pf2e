You can use the veil to go unrecognized by hiding your face so that you can attempt Deception checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Impersonate] without needing a disguise kit. When you do so, it takes you only 1 minute to create the disguise, and you gain a +1 item bonus to the check. You still need a disguise kit and the full time if you're using cosmetics and other props to change other aspects of your disguise, or if Impersonating a specific person.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activateâ€”Blazing Stare</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You dealt fire damage to a target you can see within 30 feet with your most recent action this turn</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You set your fiery gaze on your target, eyes burning within a cloud of ash and cinder.
