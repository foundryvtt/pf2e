It can be activated to produce a variety of unusual effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Activation</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> command, Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Choose a creature within 60 feet and roll a percentile die on the table below to determine the pistol's effect. If an entry lists a spell, the pistol Casts that Spell at the indicated rank (or at its lowest rank, if no rank is listed). You make any decisions for a spell cast by the pistol unless otherwise indicated, except that it must only target the creature you chose, or the creature you chose must be the center of the spell's area, if it has an area but no targets. The only exception to the limitation on targeting is if the effect specifically states it targets you. If the spell's range is less than 60 feet, increase the range to 60 feet.</p>\n<p>Any spell DC required is DC 29, and any spell attack roll required is +21. If the pistol casts a spell on you, you don't get a saving throw or any other defense against it. Once activated, the pistol can't be activated again for [[/r 1d4 #hours]]{1d4 hours}.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d%</th>\n<th>Wondrous Effect</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1-2</td>\n<td>The pistol casts @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Marvelous Mount] (4th rank) to produce a pale horse adjacent to you; only you can ride it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>The target becomes a shiny metal color (bronze, copper, or iron) and any sound or speech becomes tinny and robotic in nature; this effect lasts 1 month.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4-5</td>\n<td>The pistol casts @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Planar Tether].</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Rewrite Memory] (6th rank) causes the target to forget you ever existed; you can't Sustain the Spell.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7-13</td>\n<td>A short rod protrudes from the pistol and unfurls a small flag that reads \"Bang!\".
