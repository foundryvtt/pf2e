A <em>paradise light</em> glows brightly, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light to a further 30 feet. A PC that looks into the <em>paradise light</em> sees images of Nirvana, an idyllic pastoral paradise. A <em>paradise light</em> is required to navigate the heart of the forest in Gloaming Arbor.</p>\n<p>A <em>paradise light</em> automatically attempts to counteract any magical darkness that it's light enters. When the <em>paradise light</em> successfully counteracts an area of magical darkness, that area becomes overlain by a reflection of Nirvana, changing the appearance of the area. This illusory transformation lasts for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Activateâ€”Sanctum</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You conjure a shard of Nirvana in a 30 foot emanation, temporarily altering the landscape into an soothing meadow for 1 minute. Creatures in the area gain a +1 item bonus to Will saves and Wisdom-based skill checks, and have fast healing 2. A creature in the area that attempts to take a hostile action must succeed at a @Check[will|dc:28] save or the hostile action is prevented and the actions they would've spent are wasted.</p>"
