The ritual circle then morphs to one matching the tradition of your patron, the spells contained in your familiar appearing in the margins. During your daily preparations, your familiar performs a small jaunt around the open ritual circle to strengthen its connection to your patron.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\">f</span> envision (metamagic)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per 10 minutes</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> If your next action is to cast one of the granted spells from your patron's theme or one of the spells your familiar learned from a lesson, your patron takes notice that you're putting their power to good use and strengthens your familiar with a surge of magic.
