            "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> When you epitomize <em>The Snakebite</em>, assign it to a point of interest in the Harrow Court's swamp. This indicates a region of swampland that has become particularly infested with poisonous creatures and plants. A character who travels to this area can attempt a Crafting, Herbalism Lore, Swamp Lore, or Underworld Lore check to attempt to harvest some of their chosen poison from the region while spending 8 hours there. The DC of the check is equal to the poison's saving throw DC. Unlike most materials from the Harrow Court, poison gathered from this part of the swamp continues to exist for 1 week before vanishing, even if it's brought out of the Harrow Court.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The PC gathers 3 doses of the poison.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The PC gathers 1 dose of the poison.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The PC fails to gather any poison.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the PC is also exposed to a dose of the poison they seek.</p>",
