This marks the location of a small rocky island atop which sits a mysterious empty throne. A character who travels to this island can perform a ritual of sacrifice before the empty throne in hopes of earning good fortune. To do so, the PC must offer valuables upon the throne that are worth 100 gp &times; the character's level, spend 1 hour meditating before the throne on the nature of loss, and then attempt a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:30] check. Regardless of the check's result, the offering vanishes forever, and that PC cannot attempt a new offering until they gain an experience level and are no longer affected by their current offering.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Once during the next month, you can reroll a failed or critically failed saving throw. This is a fortune effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but you can only reroll a failed saving throw. This is a fortune effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You gain no benefit from the meditation.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The next time you critically succeed at a significant or important saving throw, as determined by the GM, you must reroll that saving throw.
