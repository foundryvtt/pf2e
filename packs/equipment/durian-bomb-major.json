Any creature hit by the bomb or in its splash area must attempt a @Check[fortitude|dc:37] saving throw. Creatures in the splash area treat the results of their saving throw as one step better. Creatures sickened by a durian bomb are unable to smell anything else while the sickened condition lasts, suppressing any scent special sense they might have.</p>\n<p>Once a creature is sickened by a durian bomb, they're immune to the sickened condition caused by other durian bombs for 1 minute.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1}.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] for 1 round and sickened 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is dazzled for 1 round and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 2}.</p>"
