If you are 20th level, on a critical success your progress is 50 gp, 100 gp, 200 gp, or 350 gp for trained, expert, master, or legendary proficiency, respectively.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">D</span> command, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You command the apparatus to magically jury-rig an item you hold or that's within 5 feet of you.
