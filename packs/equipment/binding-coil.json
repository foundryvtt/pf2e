When you activate this talisman's effect, attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Grapple] the creature you hit. On a success, rather than the normal Grapple effects, the coil instead wraps itself around the target with one end remaining attached to your weapon. Your opponent must succeed at a DC 20 Escape check to break free. The coil breaks if you move any further away from the bound opponent, but not if you move any closer.</p>"
