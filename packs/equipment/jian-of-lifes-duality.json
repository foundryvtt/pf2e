It takes on the propensity of its user, turning whiter or darker based on their actions.</p>\n<p>The effects of <em>life's duality</em> are based on the number and type of charges it has. It begins with 0 charges and can gain either dark or light charges, up to a maximum of 3 charges of one type. A charge dissipates after 10 minutes or when a charge of the opposite type is gained. If you have a charge of one type and would gain the opposite type of charge, you lose your current charges.</p>\n<p><em>Life's duality</em> gains a dark charge when it critically succeeds at a Strike against an opponent or reduces the Hit Points of a living enemy to 0. For each dark charge it has, it deals an additional @Damage[1d4[void]] damage (maximum 3d4).</p>\n<p><em>Life's duality</em> gains a light charge when you use a spell, skill check, or ability to restore at least 10 Hit Points to an ally. The damage healed must have been inflicted by a significant foe or threat. For each light charge it has, you gain 1d4 temporary Hit Points at the end of each round (maximum 3d4).</p>\n<p><strong>Activateâ€”Burst of Duality</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> <em>Life's duality</em> has 3 dark charges or 3 light charges;</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You unleash the sword's charged energy in a magical display.
