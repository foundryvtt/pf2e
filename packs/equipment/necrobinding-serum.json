The raw materials of a <em>necrobinding serum</em> are composed of a slurry made from the creator's own flesh and blood mixed with pulped fungal toxins. The exact ingredients vary, but the act of brewing a necrobinding serum is typically viewed with distaste at best and, in many societies, is regarded as an evil act. While <em>necrobinding serum</em> isn't a poison, its method of delivery is identical to that of an injury poison-it's applied to a weapon that's then used to Strike an undead target (living creatures suffer no additional effect from exposure to a dose of <em>necrobinding serum</em>). When an undead creature is targeted by a dose of <em>necrobinding serum</em>, it must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:19] save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The undead creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The undead creature is momentarily disoriented; it takes a -1 status penalty to all attack rolls made against you until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The undead creature becomes friendly toward you. If it was already friendly, it becomes helpful. It can't use hostile actions against you. This effect persists for 8 hours if the undead is mindless.
