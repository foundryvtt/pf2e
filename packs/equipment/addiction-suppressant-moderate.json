You also gain a +2 item bonus against the ongoing save against the drug's addiction depending on the type of addiction suppressant.</p>\n<p>For every drug, a specific suppressant must be crafted- no generalized addiction suppressant yet exists. In order to create an addiction suppressant, you must begin with a dose of the drug to be suppressed, then use alchemical reagents to generate an elixir that can be used to fight that drug's addiction. An addiction suppressant must be a higher level than the drug it is meant to suppress in order to work.</p>"
