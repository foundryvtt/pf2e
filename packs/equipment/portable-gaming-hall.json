Six chairs surround a circular table, 10 feet in diameter. The underside of the table contains retractable drawers full of dice, harrow cards, game pieces, and other gambling accouterments. A gallon of ale or a similar drink with a spigot near the bottom hangs on the door, replenishing to a full gallon each day; you can also bring in your own drinks if you require more than the gaming hall provides.</p>\n<p>You can flip the central table over as a 3-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to revert the gaming hall to its original form.</p>"
