When you Activate it, you gain a +4 item bonus to your saving throw against the triggering effect. If your result prevents you from being possessed, the creature that attempted to possess you is subject to a DC 37 <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Seize Soul]{Bind Soul}</em> spell, which can trap it in the talisman as if it had recently died. The talisman's magic is exhausted after use, but a soul trapped this way remains imprisoned inside, as detailed in the spell description. Starting at the end of its next turn, the trapped creature gets a new save to end the effect at the end of each of its turns.</p>"
