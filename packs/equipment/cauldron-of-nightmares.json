Good creatures are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 2} while carrying, wielding, or wearing this item crafted by the sea-witches.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">a</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The cauldron casts @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Nightmare] (@Check[type:will|dc:35|name:Nightmare|traits:mental,arcane,occult]) on a target creature that you know by name. The target must be on the same plane as you. If the target fails its save and is 15th level or lower, you add its nightmare to the cauldron. The cauldron can hold only six nightmares at a time; when you add a new nightmare, you choose which six to keep.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per week</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You spill the nightmarish contents of the cauldron onto the ground and choose one creature whose nightmare is stored in your cauldron. A nightmare copy of the chosen creature springs to life from the bubbling pile of horror. The cauldron casts @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Duplicate Foe] on the target, ignoring the range restriction, and the target automatically fails its saving throw. All enemies within 20 feet of the cauldron are subjected to a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Fear] spell (@Check[type:will|dc:35|name:Fear|traits:mental,emotion,fear,arcane,divine,occult,primal]). All other nightmares stored in the cauldron are lost. The cauldron becomes totally inert and can't be used again for 1 week.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> Supply a casting of <em>nightmare</em>.</p>"
