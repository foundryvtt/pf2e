Climbing kits allow you to attach yourself to the wall you're Climbing, moving half as quickly as usual (minimum 5 feet) but letting you attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] whenever you critically fail to prevent a fall. A single kit has only enough materials for one climber; each climber needs their own kit.</p>"
