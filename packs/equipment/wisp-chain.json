While the links of air don't jingle against each other like chain links might, the tiny cyclones nevertheless create a blustering howl akin to standing at the center of a storm. A creature that ends its turn adjacent to you must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:23] save. On a failure, it becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Deafened] until it moves away from you.</p>\n<p><strong>Activateâ€”Slicing Links</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You unbind the currents that form your armor and release them as cutting whorls of air that slice into creatures in a @Template[type:cone|distance:60]. Creatures in the area take @Damage[6d6[slashing]] damage with a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:25|basic:true] save. A creature that fails its save is also pushed 10 feet (or 20 feet on a critical failure). You lose the AC bonus of your armor until the end of your turn, when the air currents reform the wisp chain around you.</p>"
