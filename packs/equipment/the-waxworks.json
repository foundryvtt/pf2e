            "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> When <em>The Waxworks</em> is epitomized, an unsettling laboratory comes into being in the dungeons below Harrowheart. Here, bubbling cauldrons of wax sputter and smoke, while metal molds containing the likenesses of the PCs and significant NPCs from their past stand unnervingly along the walls. The laboratory is attended by a sallow-complexioned tiefling who is always way too excited and polite to visiting PCs. This tiefling knows the rituals for <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Clone]</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Simulacrum]</em>, and can teach them to the PCs. Skill checks attempted in the laboratory to perform either of these rituals gain a +2 item bonus.</p>",
