Move up to twice your Speed and make a Strike with the <em>alicorn lance</em>; you gain the effects of the lance's jousting trait on this Strike. If you were already mounted when you Activate the horn, the unicorn spirit takes shape around your steed, granting it a +10â€“foot status bonus to its Speed for the charge.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> The initial raw materials must include a horn willingly gifted by a unicorn. In rare instances, an <em>alicorn lance</em> can be made with a forcibly taken horn. However this heinous act pollutes the horn's magic, causing it to glow with a sickly red light, deal spirit damage instead of spirit damage, and make the unicorn spirit evoked in the charge to whinny visibly in pain.</p>"
