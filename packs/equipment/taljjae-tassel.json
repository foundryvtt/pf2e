They adorn clothing, weapons, and even drinking gourds. These particular tassels carry within them a potent fraction of the mysterious fey's power. When you activate a Taljjae tassel, your weapon gains the properties of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Grievous] rune for the duration of the triggering attack.</p>"
