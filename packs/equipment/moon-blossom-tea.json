Some claim to be able to tell the difference if these petals were plucked at other times, but this does not alter the tea's effects. The tea leaves have a chance to anticipate unexpected encounters. After consuming the tea, you gain a +2 item bonus to all initiative rolls for 1 hour and gain the following reaction.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Moon Blossom Tea]</p>\n<p><strong>Evade Peril</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> (envision)</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You roll a failure on a Reflex save</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You get a success on the Reflex save instead.
