When applied to a wall inside a room, all creatures within the room gain an item bonus to Stealth checks against creatures outside the room.</p>\n<p>The fulu can shield a room of up to 30 square feet, grants a +1 item bonus, and has a duration of 8 hours. If you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] within the room, you automatically become undetected to creatures of the fulu's level or lower.</p>"
