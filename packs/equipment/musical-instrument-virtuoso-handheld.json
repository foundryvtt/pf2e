The GM might rule that an especially large handheld instrument (like a tuba) has greater Bulk. Heavy instruments such as large drums, a full set of chimes, and keyboard instruments are less portable and generally need to be stationary while played.</p>\n<p>A virtuoso instrument is more finely made and gives a +1 item bonus to Performance checks using that instrument.</p>"
