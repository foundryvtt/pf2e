Now, however, spellcasters of all religions use them to enhance their capacity with teleportation magic. Adding this catalyst to a 4th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Translocate] spell allows you to bring a single willing adjacent creature along with you; however, the teleportation is somewhat disorienting for them, causing them to become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 1}.</p>"
