You attune the cube to the location you currently occupy. Each side can be attuned to only one location. Once you use this action to attune to a location, the side you pick loses any previously attuned location.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> command, envision, Interact (teleportation)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> While speaking a word of command and bringing the location into your mind, you push the corresponding side of the cube. You teleport to the location attuned to the side you press, within 100 feet of the attuned location, as long as that location is on the same planet. If it's not, your activation produces no effect, but the attunement remains.</p>"
