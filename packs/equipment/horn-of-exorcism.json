Make an Intimidation check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Demoralize] against all creatures with the undead or unholy trait in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]. This can affect even a mindless creature with that trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate—Sacred Seeds</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You fill the horn with sacred seeds and then scatter them around you with a twist of your wrist.
