            "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> A forested courtyard appears in Harrowheart, and an unusually intelligent and curious bear moves in. The bear enjoys philosophical conversations about the balance between the natural world and the urban world (the bear is annoyed at the use of the phrase \"civilized world\" and often points out that people in cities are more self-destructive than any group of wild animals). They also know several magical rituals and can teach the following rituals to the PCs if they wish: <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Awaken Animal]</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Commune]</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Primal Call]</em>. While the bear can't serve as a primary or secondary caster for these rituals, its presence grants a +2 item bonus to any skill checks made to cast these rituals here.</p>",

After the effect of the initial Grapple ends, you can't keep a target grabbed with a weapon that lacks the grapple trait. The status bonus increases to +3 if you're at least 17th level.</p>"
