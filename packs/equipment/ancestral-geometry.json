Your family's ancestral stories, recited throughout the tattooing process, bind your blood even tighter to theirs. During your daily preparations, you manifest a visitation by an ancestor—possibly via a dream, a vision, or a magical trinket left by your bedroll. Roll [[/r 2d20]] and record the highest result. Then roll [[/r 1d6]] and note a type of saving throw: 1–2 Fortitude, 3–4 Reflex, and 5–6 Will.</p>\n<p>In addition, until the next visitation, you gain a +1 item bonus to one Lore skill related to the ancestor, as determined by the GM. Usually, the ancestor provides a kind of knowledge they believe you'll need. For dwarven ancestors, the Lore skill is usually Architecture Lore, Engineering Lore, Genealogy Lore, Labor Lore, Mining Lore, Warfare Lore, or Lore about a dwarven deity.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">R</span> envision (fortune)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You rolled a saving throw of the noted type</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Replace the roll with the d20 roll from your ancestor's visitation.</p>"
