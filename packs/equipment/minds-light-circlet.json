When you're charged with mental power, the jewels scintillate with light, with different gems resonating based on your emotions. If you have at least 1 Focus Point, the gems cast dim light in a 10-foot radius. When you amp a spell, the light increases to bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>You gain a +2 item bonus to Occultism checks. You also gain the following amp, which you can apply to any of your psi cantrips that have a target or area, much like an amp gained from a feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Amp</strong> You transfer some of the magical luminescence from the mind's light circlet to one of the creatures. Choose a creature targeted by the spell or in its area. Until the start of your next turn, that creature sheds bright light in a 20â€‘foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) and can't be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed]. If the creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Invisible], it's concealed while alight, rather than being undetected.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\">F</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can use only to use a psychic amp.
