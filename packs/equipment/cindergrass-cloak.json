The cloak's resistance to fire increases to 15 against the triggering effect. Until the end of your next turn, your flat check to remove persistent fire damage is 10 instead of 15, which is reduced to 5 if another creature uses a particularly appropriate action to help. If you take at least 5 points of fire damage after applying the fire resistance, the cloak gains the broken condition.</p>"
