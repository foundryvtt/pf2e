When the draconic god Dahak threatened destruction, Iyalirrin was the primary architect of a powerful ritual to banish him called the anima invocation. Iyalirrin and many others were forced to sacrifice themselves to empower this ritual, but he ensured his <em>Anima Robe</em> remained in good hands before he did so. Since then, the <em>Anima Robe</em> has been worn by dozens of elven occultists and bards who have traveled Golarion and beyond. The <em>Anima Robe</em> has remained in the care of Queen Telandia for only the past few dozen years.</p>\n<p>While wearing the <em>Anima Robe</em>, you gain a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks made to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Make an Impression] and to all Performance checks.
