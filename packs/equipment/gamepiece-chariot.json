Sometimes, though, mischievous adolescents snatched pieces like this one for joyriding.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You place the figurine on the ground and roll it forward. As the chariot begins to move, it rapidly expands to the size of a Large heavy chariot pulled by two animated stone war horses. You can board the chariot and drive it up to 80 feet in a straight line. You can move through spaces occupied by creatures of size Medium or smaller, dealing [[/r (4d8+10)[bludgeoning]]] damage to those creatures. Affected creatures must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:28|basic:true] save; on a failure, a creature is knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone]. The chariot returns to its figurine form once it stops moving.</p>"
