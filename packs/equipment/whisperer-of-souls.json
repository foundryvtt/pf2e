            "value": "<p>This <em>+4 major striking greater brilliant keen glaive</em> binds the souls of powerful creatures it slays. The soul can't be returned to life by any means while imprisoned within the glaive and can be freed only by a deed of great benevolence or selflessness. While using the glaive as a weapon, whenever you reduce a sapient creature of 18th level or higher to 0 Hit Points or roll a critical success with a Strike against such a target, the creature must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:50] save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> No additional effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The glaive siphons the creature's essence, rendering it @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 1}. If the creature dies from the Strike or while drained in this way, the creature's soul is bound in the glaive.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 2}.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As success, but the creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 4}.</p>\n<p>The glaive also has the following activations.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">F</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You Strike with the Whisperer of Souls</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You choose whether the Strike deals lethal or nonlethal damage. If the glaive has a reason for doing so, such as slaying a creature whose soul the glaive can absorb, it can defy your choice if you fail a @Check[type:will|dc:50] save.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">F</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You attempt an Occultism check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Decipher Writing], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Identify Magic], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Learn a Spell], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Recall Knowledge]</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You listen to eldritch secrets the weapon whispers, gaining a +4 item bonus to the triggering check.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> command, envision, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per week</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Attempt an Occultism check as if you cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Collective Memories]</em> ritual about a subject. If you roll a success or critical success, you can repeat what the <em>Whisperer of Souls</em> relates to you about the subject. On a critical failure, you and the glaive are drawn into a murmuring void of cold, where your mind is assaulted by strange visions for an entire week. At the end of this time, you reappear and must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:50] save.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> When you return, you can retrain one of your skills into a Lore skill about evil creatures or places, as if you had spent 1 week retraining.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 2} for 1 week.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As success, but your alignment moves one step toward evil and you must retrain one of your skills into a Lore about evil creatures or places. You become obsessed with increasing your forbidden knowledge, turning to wicked forces that offer such secrets and compromising your morals further if you must.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> If the <em>Whisperer of Souls</em> is used to slay Shelyn's herald, it disintegrates, bringing about great evil in its wake.</p>"
