The soul can't be returned to life by any means while imprisoned within the glaive and can be freed only by a deed of great benevolence or selflessness. While using the glaive as a weapon, whenever you reduce a sapient creature of 18th level or higher to 0 Hit Points or roll a critical success with a Strike against such a target, the creature must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:50] save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> No additional effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The glaive siphons the creature's essence, rendering it @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 1}.

If you roll a success or critical success, you can repeat what the <em>Whisperer of Souls</em> relates to you about the subject. On a critical failure, you and the glaive are drawn into a murmuring void of cold, where your mind is assaulted by strange visions for an entire week. At the end of this time, you reappear and must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:50] save.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> When you return, you can retrain one of your skills into a Lore skill about evil creatures or places, as if you had spent 1 week retraining.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 2} for 1 week.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As success, but your alignment moves one step toward evil and you must retrain one of your skills into a Lore about evil creatures or places.
