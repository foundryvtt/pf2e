When a key is placed within and the box closed, the wax is displaced by the key, leaving an accurate impression of its shape. Once the key is removed, the impression left behind will remain indefinitely and can later be used to cast a duplicate key. Inserting, impressing, or removing a key each requires an Interact action. The wax inside this blank can be reused, though it must be smoothed over between uses, erasing any previous impression.</p>"
