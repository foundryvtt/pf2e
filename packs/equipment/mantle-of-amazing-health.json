While somewhat off-putting, the mantle grants a +2 status bonus to all Fortitude saving throws against disease and poison. When you invest the mantle, you either increase your Constitution score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">R</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You take damage</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Drawing the cloak around you, you reduce the damage taken by 10.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> envision, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> If you're currently afflicted by a poison or a disease, you can hold the cloak tight to your body and immediately attempt a saving throw to end the effect.
