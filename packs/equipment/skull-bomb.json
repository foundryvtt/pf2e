While performing a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Create Undead]</em> ritual, you can attach this skull bomb to the target creature in place of its own head. In order to do so, the target creature must be Medium and have the humanoid trait. The target creature can have only one skull bomb attached in this fashion. The creature gains the following ability.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Throw Skull <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (manipulate)</p>\n<p>The creature detaches its skull bomb and hurls the volatile explosive at a point within 30 feet. The skull explodes, dealing @Damage[7d6[fire]] damage to creatures within a @Template[type:burst|distance:15] (@Check[type:reflex|dc:24|basic:true] save). The skull is permanently destroyed and can't be used again, and the throwing creature is permanently @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Blinded] and headless.</p>"
