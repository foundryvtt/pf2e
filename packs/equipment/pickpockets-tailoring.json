When you get a failure (but not a critical failure, which works as normal) on a Stealth check to Conceal such an Object, observers know you're concealing an object somewhere, but they don't find the object unless they succeed at a @Check[type:perception|dc:20|name:Find a Pickpocket Pocket|showDC:all] check to locate the seams in the garment.</p>"
