It can also be used to mime playing a violin when no instrument is at hand, but in this case, it grants no item bonus to resulting Performance checks.</p>\n<p>A <em>sinew-song's</em> primary use is as a weapon—it can be wielded as if it were a <em>+3 keen greater thundering greater striking sickle</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Cutting Cadenza</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (manipulate, sonic)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You Stride once and then swipe the weapon through the air three times.
