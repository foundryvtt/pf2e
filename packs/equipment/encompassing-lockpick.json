The lockpick itself is surprisingly malleable, belying the components within. An almost-impossible number of other tools are hidden in the compartment, including an entire set of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Thieves' Toolkit (Infiltrator)]{Infiltrator Thieves' Tools} and any @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Thieves' Toolkit (Infiltrator Picks)]{Replacement Picks (Infiltrator Picks)}, an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Disguise Kit (Elite)]{Elite Disguise Kit} and any @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Disguise Kit (Elite Cosmetics)]{Replacement Cosmetics (Elite)}, and an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Climbing Kit (Extreme)]{Extreme Climber's Kit}, all while still somehow remaining only light Bulk. This makes the encompassing lockpick a favorite discreet option for rogues infiltrating high society events, as formal wear generally has few pockets and only allows a character to wear a single tool kit of light Bulk.</p>"
