The creature can also Activate the <em>witch token</em> to Cast a Spell once per day. This spell is chosen from one of the uniila's arcane spontaneous spells of rank 4 or lower when the uniila creates the token. While a creature has the <em>witch token</em> invested, it treats its saving throws against the uniila's spells as one degree of success worse, and the uniila always knows the distance and direction to the creature. A creature can't have more than one <em>witch token</em> invested, and an uniila can't have more than one <em>witch token</em> in existence. The uniila can destroy their <em>witch token</em> as a free action with the concentrate trait; if the <em>witch token</em> is invested when the uniila does so, the creature that has the <em>witch token</em> invested takes @Damage[9d8[mental]] damage (@Check[type:will|dc:29|basic:true]).</p>"
