The swarm flies to the triggering enemy's space and swarms about them, dealing @Damage[1d8[persistent,poison]]. If the affected enemy has any allies within 30 feet, the enemy can spend a single action, which has the manipulate trait, to shoo the swarm away. This ends the persistent damage on that enemy automatically, but the swarm instead moves to affect the enemy's ally.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> The initial raw materials must include 1 Bulk of wasp exoskeletons.</p>"
