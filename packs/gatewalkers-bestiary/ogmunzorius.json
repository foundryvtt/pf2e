The secondary caster attempting the Crafting check creates a warding diagram to prevent the extraplanar creature from attacking or leaving during the bargain; if that caster fails or critically fails, then instead of the usual effects of a failure or critical failure of the secondary skill check, the extraplanar creature can attack or leave instead of negotiate. You can also leave out this step, removing the need for a Crafting check, with the same result (if you're summoning a good extraplanar creature you trust, for example). The creature can also attack or leave if you use any hostile action against it or if the warding diagram breaks. Once the diagram is complete, you and the secondary casters each take your places at specific points at the diagram's edge where power concentrates.</p>\n<p>You conjure the extraplanar creature within your wards and negotiate a deal with it, generally to perform a task for you in exchange for payment. A creature that doesn't wish to negotiate at all can attempt a Will save to stay on its home plane. Most good and neutral extraplanar creatures feel that they have something better to do than cater to the whims of mortals and require a significant gift, especially if your task poses significant risks. Evil extraplanar creatures are more likely to accept a bargain for a lower cost as long as it allows them to wreak havoc on the Material Plane or inflict evil upon the world along the way. Monetary prices usually range from the cost of a consumable item of the creature's level for a short and simple task to a permanent magic item of the creature's level or more to persuade the creature to fight alongside you. However, some extraplanar creatures may want payments other than money, such as permission to cast a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Geas]</em> on you to fulfill an unspecified later favor or obtain ownership of your soul via an infernal contract. If you can't come to an agreement in a reasonable length of time after you've made your case, the extraplanar creature can return from whence it came at any time.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You call the extraplanar creature and bind it in the wards for up to a full day before it returns home, potentially allowing you to negotiate a better deal by threatening to leave it in the wards for the full day.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You call the extraplanar creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to call the extraplanar creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You call something dark and horrible, unbound by your wards, and it immediately attempts to destroy you.</p>"

            "publicNotes": "<p>An animate dream coalesces from centuries of stray fragments of reverie and dream left behind as slumbering minds drift through the Dimension of Dreams. In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",
