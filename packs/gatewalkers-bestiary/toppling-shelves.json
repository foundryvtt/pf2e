Creatures in the area take @Damage[(4d8+10)[bludgeoning]] (@Check[type:reflex|dc:25|basic:true]). A creature that critically fails its save falls @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone]. The affected area becomes difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>If the toppling shelf crashes into a space occupied by another toppling shelf, it triggers that shelf's Topple reaction. This can result in a chain reaction that causes multiple shelves to Topple, one after the other.</p>"
