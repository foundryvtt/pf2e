A creature within 10 feet of one end of the bridge can attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:18] saving throw to Grab a Ledge along the side of either <strong>A8</strong> or <strong>A13</strong>.</p>\n<p>If one side of the bridge has been disabled by resecuring the ropes, a character on any section of the bridge can attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:18] save to hang onto the bridge as one side of it falls. The dangling bridge thereafter functions as a ladder connecting either area <strong>A8</strong> or <strong>A13</strong> (whichever was secured) to the forest floor.</p>"
