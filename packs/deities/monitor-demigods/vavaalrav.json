The Steeple's Skull does not tolerate when the sanctity of a holy site or the rest of the dead is disturbed, and his symbol is used by mortals to ward graves against foul spirits and grave robbers alike.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Steeple's Skull</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Gargoyles, holy ground, rest</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Create and erect grave markers, lay bodies to rest, protect graveyards and sacred grounds from despoilment and supernatural threats</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Treat grave sites irreverently, allow others to despoil the dead or rob a grave, create undead, desecrate a corpse</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> vertical line with a horizontal crossbar near the top and a circle around the overlap</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> hound</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> gray</p>"
