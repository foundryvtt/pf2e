            "value": "<p>The brains of the four goblin creator-gods, Zogmugot is a goddess with a baleful temper and obsessive temperament. Depictions of Lady Lastbreath show her as a barghest with sea-green fur. Always watching with her colorful sea-glass eyes, goblins risk much by gaining her attention. She dislikes being bothered by mortal petitioners, and if she decides that a goblin should have figured out a problem on their own, she is quick to unleash her wrath. Zogmugot is in charge of deciding whether a goblin drowns in water or is washed back ashore, and she viciously drowns her victims when she's in a bad mood. Most goblins ritually placate her for this reason, while followers desperate to get her attention go to the depths of the sea and attempt to drown themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> Lady Lastbreath</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Drowning, invention, self-sufficiency</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Ply the sea, work fervently and without help, use what is given to you</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Unnecessarily seek divine attention or guidance, disrespect the water, bury a piece of sea glass</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> seaweed draped chest</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> crab</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> blue, brown</p>"
