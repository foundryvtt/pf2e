His mouth drips a magma-like substance that mimics molten saliva.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Bark Breaker</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Arson, hunt, ritual</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Learn mounted combat, perform arson, hunt and kill dogs</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Befriend or spare a dog</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> severed dog's paw</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> goblin dog</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> orange, yellow</p>"
