Long after her mortal death, she returned as a herald of the god Aroden and fought alongside mortals during one of their darkest hours. But humanity and her patron alike abandoned her-first to the Whispering Tyrant, then to the necromancer Geb-and the torments she endured because of it changed her deeply. Still she survived, her broken body reanimated against her will as a powerful undead monstrosity. For over a millennium she was held captive as the lich queen of the undead nation of Geb, and her view of mortals, and humanity in particular, soured.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> act with dignity, do whatever it takes to survive, despise and never forgive those who have hurt you</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> create unwilling undead, insult Arazni</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> abused, dignity, unwilling undeath</p>"
