As a result, countless works of art and philosophy have been produced by mortals that touch upon aspects of this Great Old One, each subtly lengthening the god's reach.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Dreamer in the Deep</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Cataclysms, dreams, the stars</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Create art inspired by dreams, destroy magical seals that contain destructive forces, influence the dreams of other</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> None</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> complex rune surrounding an open eye</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> none</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> black, blue</p>"
