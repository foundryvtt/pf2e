Because he has walked the world in mortal form, Nyarlathotep is unique among the Outer Gods for appearing comprehensible and understandableâ€”but this is a facade. The Crawling Chaos, as he is also known, appears humanlike not because he identifies with mortal concerns or cares for his mortal followers, but because a mortal shape makes it easier for him to do his work: spreading the influence of the Outer Gods.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Veiled Voice</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Dangerous secrets, long-term plans, reckless innovation</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Innovate destructive alchemy or magic, instigate conflict between your enemies, share dangerous secrets</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> None</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> a pair of runed lips pursed in a whisper</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> panther</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> black, purple</p>"
