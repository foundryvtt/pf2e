Anything prior to that is currently undocumented or lost as a result of this cataclysmic event.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The First Jarl</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Ice, salt, tribute</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Take any valuables you come across, fiercely defend your treasure, never back down from a fight</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Show anyone in your command favoritism, give up any of your own treasures, take the Test of the Starstone</p>"
