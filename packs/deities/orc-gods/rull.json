During the ensuing Crucible, Rull claims to have won by consuming the lightning spirit he had challenged, and that it now lives within him and is under his control.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Thunderer</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Lightning, storms, thunder</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Create chaos at every opportunity, be loud wherever you go, spread fear and terror in Rull's name</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Enforce law and order, show mercy, allow morals to impede the sowing of chaos</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> thunder cloud and lightning</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> terror bird</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> green, yellow</p>"
