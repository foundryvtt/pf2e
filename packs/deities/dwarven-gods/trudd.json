Despite his relatively young age, Trudd is the strongest deity in the dwarven pantheon, and as a result is often left to guard his father's halls while Torag is absent. For a dwarf, Trudd sports a remarkably short beard, spawning many tales, including one that he sold it for some unknown boon.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Mighty</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Bravery, defense, strength</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Offer your strength to aid others, protect those weaker than you</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Engage in petty demonstrations of strength, use your strength to take advantage of others</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> warhammer in front of a golden shield</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> bear</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> brown, gray</p>"
