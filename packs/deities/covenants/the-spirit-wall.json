The densest concentration of this covenant's worshippers resides in the town of Gundrun, the only stable settlement during the demonic occupation. Generally practical people, devotees care less about the nature of the Boundary of Strength than its effectiveness. This covenant is frequently invoked by night guards on patrol and those attempting to cleanse, salvage, or study the <em>wardstones</em> that remain scattered around the Sarkoris Scar.</p>\n<p><strong>Covenant Members</strong> Dolok Darkfur, Kagia, Stag Mother of the Forest of Stones, stone elementals</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> boundaries, containment, guardianship</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> establish and protect your personal territory, punish trespassers, safeguard lawful visitors</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> abandon a guard post, cede territory to an invader</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> stone wall</p>"
