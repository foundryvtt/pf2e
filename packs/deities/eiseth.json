Foremost among the Queens of the Night, she embodies battle, revenge, and wrath, and her ambitions are as lofty as her aerie of Widow's Cry, where she forges souls of the damned into unequaled infernal legions answering to her alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Avenge all insults, claim what you desire and deserve, humiliate your foes in ironic fashion</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Allow a slight to go unanswered, show humility or fear</p>"
