He tends to his fields and gardens with exact precision, ensuring that every leaf and branch is of perfect size, shape, and position.

His creations now are physically perfect, but ideologically cold.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> Custodian of Oak and Ash</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Cultivation, forestry, gardening, security, wood</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Patiently plant your seeds, plan for orderly beauty, watch over your sproutlings</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Abandon your post, neglect your crops, purposely pervert nature</p>"
