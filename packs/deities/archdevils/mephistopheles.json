He views mortals as nothing more than a source of power for the infernal realm, but he nevertheless has followers who share his affinity for the power of law and loophole.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Crimson Son</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Contracts, devils, secrets</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Master laws and use them to your benefit, enable the desperate, excoriate others with veiled mockery</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Break a contract you made, get caught breaking the law</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> trident and ring</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> mockingbird</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> red, yellow</p>"
