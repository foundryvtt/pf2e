Few have seen Xiquiripat and lived to tell tales of their constantly shifting guise, which changes from waves of congealed blood to a knot of fanged lampreys to a heaving mass of matted hair. Though this god's form is fluid, their goals are less so, as Xiquiripat has had only one unbending desire since the dawn of their existence: to instill fear into every living thing they meet before condemning them to oblivion.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Flying Scab</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Evisceration, fatal falls, massacres</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Never show mercy, pursue your enemies to their end or yours, teach all to fear you</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Accept surrender from an enemy, show cowardice or weakness</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> metal sphere covered in bloody spikes</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> shrike</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> black, purple</p>"
