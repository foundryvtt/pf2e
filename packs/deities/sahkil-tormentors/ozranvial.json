Instead, she takes great pleasure in inserting herself into someone's life and pulling it apart until they are utterly broken by her machinations. The intimacy of a relationship makes its destruction all the more beautiful. Ozranvial will foster a relationship over years and even decades to enjoy the devastating outcome of her cruelty. She rules over the restless spirits created from the emotional damage she inflicts, tormenting them even after death.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> Despair's Smile</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Despair, restless spirits, sadism</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Be amicable until the time is right to strike, give false hope to all, make the choice that will cause more pain</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Apologize sincerely for your actions, show emotional vulnerability</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> teardrop with a malevolent grin</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> hyena</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> orange, yellow</p>"
