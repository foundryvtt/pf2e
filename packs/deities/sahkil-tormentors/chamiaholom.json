Chamiaholom's form is a towering skeleton over 14 feet tall, wielding a staff made from the skulls of his victims. He is sometimes glimpsed around sites of tragedy and destruction and stalks those who've survived near-death experiences, terrifying witnesses who mistake him for death incarnate. Chamiaholom's followers wear dark paint on their faces to imitate the tormentor's skeletal visage as they travel around Golarion preaching their message of despair.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> Skull Staff</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Domination, hopelessness, mortality</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Accept the futility of life, destroy sentient undead, punish those who somehow avoid death</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Comfort the dying, seek immortality or unnatural longevity</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> staff made of skulls</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> maggot</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> gray, black, white</p>"
