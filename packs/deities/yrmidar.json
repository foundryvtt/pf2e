            "value": "<p>Yrmidar is a werebear frost giant deity of shipbuilders, camaraderie, and the hunt. When in his giant form, he is depicted as a frost giant with long silver hair in a braid that reaches past the small of his back, snowwhite eyes, and sharp obsidian-black fingernails. In his hybrid form, which is his most common form, his head transforms into that of a polar bear and his fingernails grow to become a bear's claws. In his werebear form, he becomes an enormous, bipedal polar bear with deadly fangs and claws. When he transforms into this beast, even the most battle-hardened of deities steer clear of him. Most mortals and gods alike consider this affliction a curse, but Yrmidar does not share that belief. To him and many of his followers, it is a power and a responsibility to be proud of and at peace with.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Old Bear</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Camaraderie, the hunt, shipbuilders</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Help your fellow neighbor, properly maintain ships and other sailing vessels you own, contribute to your community</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Be too proud to give or ask for help, intentionally provoke wild animals, choose yourself over your community</p>"
