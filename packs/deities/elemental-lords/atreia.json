When the multiverse was young, Atreia soared across the Plane of Fire as a triple-headed ibis, with wings that burned and eyes of flame, routing evil from the plane. Though his strength was weakened from a long imprisonment, he maintained worship among some groups of munsahirs on the Plane of Fire for his dominion over protection and life-giving fire. With his return, his worship now also extends to a few circles of mortals who hold the discovery and purification of evil above all other causes.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Lambent King</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Fire, purification, radiance</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Burn away corruption, clear the way for new growth, purify tainted areas</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Abandon a creature in darkness; deny a suffering creature warmth, shade, or water</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> flaming wheel with six ibis wings</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> ibis</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> orange, white</p>"
