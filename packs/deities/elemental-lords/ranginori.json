When he appears before mortals, Ranginori takes the form of an immense, lion-headed serpent spun from forbidding clouds, with hundreds of clawed feet and a mane that dances with lightning. The Zephyrous Prince has accumulated a small but loyal following in search of liberation, hope, and change for the multiverse. His realm on the Plane of Air is the Roaring Spark, a floating spiral of ruins that branch outward from a central crack of thunder.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Zephyrous Prince</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Air, thunderstorms, welcome breezes</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Open closed areas to fresh air, travel throughout your surroundings daily, fly or make creations that fly</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Wrongfully imprison a creature, restrain a creature longer or more tightly than is necessary, suffocate a creature</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> infinity sign of clouds and claws</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> storm petral</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> cyan, white</p>"
