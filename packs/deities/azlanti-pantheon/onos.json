Slow to anger and mild-mannered, priests of Onos often served as mediators in times of conflict.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> God of Many Doors</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Elements, embassies, extraplanar travel</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Mediate conflicts, respect each element equally, experience travel as often as possible</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Act before weighing both sides, solve problems with aggression before negotiating, play favorites in negotiation</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> swirling portal made of elements</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> none</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> none</p>"
