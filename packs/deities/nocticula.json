Those days are behind Nocticula, for she has risen to the role of the Redeemer Queen, a patron of marginalized artists and protector of those cast out from society. She is now feared among her former peers for her persuasive words that tempt them away from their place in the Abyss and toward redemption. Her faith is strongest in the eastern reaches of New Thassilon, where her most powerful exile, Queen Sorshen, seeks to build a nation that welcomes those whom others have cast out.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> create art true to yourself, protect marginalized artists, punish those who take advantage of offered trust and shelter</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> deny shelter to the desperate, destroy harmless art you dislike, finish a work of art during daylight hours</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> artists, exiles, midnight</p>"
