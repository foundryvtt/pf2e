The once-mortal nephew of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Irori] is believed to have ascended to godhood himself after creating the holy book <em>Azvadeva Pujila</em>, fully embodying all divine wisdom within the text. Originating in Vudra, the Keeper's faith has slowly gained popularity in the Inner Sea region, particularly in Jalmeray, where Irori already has a wide following. Gruhastha manifests as a human man with an idealized form, augmented with wings of red and green plumage and a golden mandala as a halo.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Keeper</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> enlightenment, the Vudrani holy book</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> work toward collective transcendence, expose and root out malicious lies, challenge oppression through education, protect knowledge, seek truth</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> deny a sincere student education, destroy knowledge, disrespect the traditions of those around you, willfully spread ignorance or wrong information</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> mandala with books as compass points</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> tortoise</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Color</strong> teal, green</p>"
