According to legend, Kabriri is the reborn form of the first humanoid to ever devour his kin in life. His realm, Everglut, is connected to graveyards throughout the multiverse by a snarled network of tunnels that bring knowledge and sacrifices to the demon lord. Kabriri appears as a hulking ghoul with elven ears, teeth filed to points, an unnaturally long tongue, ashen skin, and cloven hooves. He is worshipped primarily by ghouls and ghasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> Him Who Gnaws</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Ghouls, graves, secrets kept by the dead</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Eat the flesh of your own kind</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Reveal secrets of the dead to nonbelievers, despoil grave markers</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> skull bowl of maggots</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> grave worms</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> blue, ivory</p>"
