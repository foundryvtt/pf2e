To Izuyaku, wellness is a balance between the needs of the body and the needs of the mind; they encourage the devout to regularly exercise their body but also to rest and relax for equal periods. Appropriately, Izuyaku is often depicted as a gentle-faced human with both masculine and feminine features reclining in a hot spring bath, their stocky build having both muscle and fat in equal measure.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Strength and Serenity</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> balance, strength, health, and hot springs</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> keep communal bodies of water safe and clean, practice good hygiene, strengthen yourself and others physically or emotionally</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> intentionally spread a disease, neglect your personal wellness without good cause</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> circle of stones surrounding a rippling pool of water</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> snow monkey</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> bright orange, vivid blue</p>"
