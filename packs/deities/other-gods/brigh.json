            "value": "<p>Brigh's exact origins are unknown, though her priests and various religious scholars have many theories on the matter. Some believe she was a construct who achieved consciousness and a spark of divinity, while others think she was a human alchemist and inventor who discovered ways to fuse mechanical components with her own physiology. Regardless of her origins, Brigh is a patient and thoughtful god who promotes unending curiosity and constant intellectual advancement. Her two most common forms are a humanoid woman made of bronze clockwork and a human woman wearing a bronze skullcap and armor composed of gears and other movable metal pieces. Though Brigh's usual demeanor is composed and reserved, she isn't an unfeeling automaton; she deeply cherishes the creations she and her followers make, and most of her worshippers feel the same way.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Whisper in Bronze</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> clockwork, invention, time</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> craft new creations, pay attention to details, share achievements</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> carelessly destroy others' creations or research, enslave intelligent constructs, abuse constructs, refuse to acknowledge or learn from mistakes</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> mask with forehead runes</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> termite</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Color</strong> bronze, silver</p>"
