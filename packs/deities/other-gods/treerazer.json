Reduced in power to that of a nascent demon lord, Treerazer spent some time lying low before turning his attention to the abandoned elven lands of Kyonin. When his attempt to corrupt that realm resulted in the elves' return to defend their home and oppose his pestilent influence, Treerazer was forced to retreat again to the depths of a fetid swampland known as Tanglebriar.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> Lord of the Blasted Tarn</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> corruption of nature, pollution, slaughter of elves</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> corrupt plant life with evil or fungal influences, feast on rotten flesh or fungus, slay elves</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> grant mercy to elves, plant trees, encourage natural plant growth</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> axe stuck into a bleeding tree stump</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> deinonychus</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> black, green</p>"
