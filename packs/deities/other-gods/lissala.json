Her teachings created the foundation of the Seven Virtues of Rule, later adopted by the realm of Thassilon. While those seven virtues held aspects of charity, humility, and love, Lissala encouraged her followers to focus more prominently on teachings of duty and strict adherence to her guidelines. She believed, and taught, that those who followed her teachings would be greatly rewarded.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Sihedron Scion</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Obedience, reward of service, runes</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Work hard and demand others do so as well, cooperate or avoid conflict with ophidian creatures</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Disobey a superior, shirk your duties, destroy a book</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> sihedron</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> snake</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> gold, green</p>"
