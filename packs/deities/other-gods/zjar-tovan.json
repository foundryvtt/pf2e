            "value": "<p>Zjar-Tovan is a name few are familiar with, as those who worship the Bladesoul are often mistaken for devotees of a god of the forge, such as Torag, or champions of a mighty military god, such as Iomedae. But to Zjar-Tovan, a weapon is more than just a tool. It is a statement against restriction or captivity, and a method to impart one's will against those who would resist embracing freedom of self-expression. To use a weapon is to make a choice, and as a sentient and living apparatus of war, Zjar-Tovan blesses those who use their tools with conviction, no matter their actions or cause.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Bladesoul</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> armaments, motivation, self-expression</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> aid those who cannot freely live as they would choose to, do not allow your purpose to be overly guided by another's will, inspire others with your personal convictions</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> belittle an ally (or someone you respect) when they express their beliefs, serve a cause you do not truly believe in</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> half-finished sword resting on an anvil</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> none</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> blue, gray, silver</p>"
