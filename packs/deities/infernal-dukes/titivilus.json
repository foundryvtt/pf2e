His is a slender form, almost like a human man stretched well beyond his typical proportions, with skin the color of the deep purples of a sunset. Nine hands, each with nine fingers, transcribe every word spoken within the rings in illustrious longhand and great detail, down to the tones and rhythms. Steel is a crude tool for change; the Scrivening Count would crumble empires with but a whisper. A spear and shield may break a body, but lies, propaganda, rhetoric, and truth manipulate the hearts and minds that drive the hands.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Scrivener</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Lies, propaganda, rhetoric, truth</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Quote people back to themselves, chronicle the times you live in, skew the truth to your purpose</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Allow a rumor to go unchallenged, destroy records, trust in memory alone</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> devil hand writing</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> viper</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> black, white</p>"
