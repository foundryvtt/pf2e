            "value": "<p>Before he was a god, Baekho was a tiger who protected the forests of Tian Xia. Once, when he was gravely injured, he sheltered under the branches of a persimmon tree. As he experienced the changing of seasons beneath the tree's branches, an innate understanding of the world stirred within him. He awakened as a divine spirit with a human form with white hair, black-tipped white tiger ears, and deep blue tiger eyes. In his feline form, the fur that had once been an inferno of orange became a blinding white. His religious symbol, a snow-tipped persimmon branch laden with vibrant red-orange fruit, represents his awakening as a divine spirit who cherishes harmony.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Lord of the Seasons</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Balance, healing, nature, seasons</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Bridge rifts between allies, embrace change, consider all sides of a disagreement before passing judgment</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Allow bias to guide your judgment, reject change in favor of stagnation, sow discord between allies, take more than you give</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> persimmon branch against the sun</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> tiger</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> orange, white</p>"
