Whether inspired by Arazni's unyielding spirit, Milani's selflessness, or Calistria's thirst for vengeance, those who worship the Last Breath will never yield to tyrants, bullies, or abusers. Deeply self-reliant, these faithful rarely trouble the goddesses with lengthy prayers, merely asking for the strength to honor their convictions and the resolve to hold out despite all odds.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> punish oppressors, resist those who would control you and others, turn others' power against them</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> give in to despair, surrender</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> defiance, perseverance, and triumph over impossible odds</p>\n<p><strong>Pantheon Members</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Arazni], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Calistria], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Milani]</p>"
