These six gods exemplify the positive traditions of elven society, including the study of magic, cohabitation with nature, the appreciation and creation of beautiful arts and crafts, and close friendships with other elves. Aiuvarins who wish a closer connection to their elven ancestry also worship the Sovyrian Conclave.</p>\n<p><strong>Pantheon Members</strong> Alseta, Calistria, Desna, Findeladlara, Ketephys, Yuelral</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> elves, magic, nature, tradition</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> explore the worlds outside and within, learn and appreciate traditional elven arts, crafts, and magic</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> have an unhealthy obsession or attachment, irreparably damage the natural environment (such as by overhunting or strip mining)</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> braided vine</p>"
