These three goddesses have been romantically involved with one another from time to time, so it makes sense that they would form a coalition. In addition to defeating the wicked, the Radiant Prism promotes the creation of beautiful works of art to bring more grace to the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Pantheon Members</strong> Desna, Sarenrae, Shelyn</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> create works that inspire good acts, defend those who cannot defend themselves, pursue evil</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> allow evil to spread, destroy that which brings joy to others, fail to offer evil a chance to surrender</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> rainbow arcing between the sun and a twinkling star</p>"
