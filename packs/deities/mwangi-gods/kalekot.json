To those that society can't punish, Kalekot is executioner, striking from the shadows and leaving bodies to rot on the ground. To those lost at night, Kalekot is a silent follower, a guardian from danger. Those few who have glimpsed him describe a figure with withered skin and a snake's twisting spine. He always conceals his features behind an eyeless mask, its mouth filled with serpent's teeth, each fang the size of an elephant's tusk.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Winnower</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Fear, silence, safekeeping, the reviled</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Spread fear in others, hide dangerous secrets, shock the self-righteous, kill the guilty to protect the innocent</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Abuse someone you have accepted power over, allow a victim to escape due to gloating, snivel before authority, shout</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> Snake piercing its head with a dagger</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> Two-headed animals</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> gray, red</p>"
