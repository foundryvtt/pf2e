His twisting tail churns the air into clouds, his creations spreading water to all those who thirst. His sliding scales till the earth, bringing forth plants that are nourished by Uvuko's rains. The worship of Uvuko is widespread in the Mwangi Expanse, found among many lizardfolk tribes, Mbe'ke and Taralu dwarves, and in the more cosmopolitan cities.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Diamond Ring</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Metamorphosis, cycles, growth, fertility</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Embrace change and the future, master adversity with flexibility, foster freedom and progress for others</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> &gt;Allow yourself and your surroundings to stagnate, crush an egg, use vile or cruel language</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> serpent curled in a ring</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> swift</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> blue, white</p>"
