Her intervention is widely known to inflict corruptions and terrible nightmares. Ostracized individuals who share her ideals will find this intervention a boon, while others treat similar events as horrible curses.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> bring power to outcasts and the downtrodden, indoctrinate children in Lamashtu's teachings, make the beautiful monstrous, reveal the corruption and flaws in all things</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> attempt to treat a mental illness or deformity, provide succor to Lamashtu's enemies</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> aberrance, monsters, and nightmares</p>"
