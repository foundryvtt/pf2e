However, his following has grown rapidly among the young stone and marsh giants of a more violent incline. Even in the short amount of time that he has been a part of the giant pantheon, there have already been countless tales of his barbarity. In all of them, he is described as a blood-splattered stone giant man with a burly build, pauldrons fashioned from deer or moose skulls, and a jagged onyx-black greatsword with a length that rivals his height.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> Breaker of Bones</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Battle, brutality, strength</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Fight anyone who disrespects you, be in the front line of battle, fight to the death</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Flee from battle, show mercy to your enemy, beg for mercy</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> bear totem</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> grizzly bear</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> brown, red</p>"
