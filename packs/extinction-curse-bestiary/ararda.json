These communities eventually left the vault or died out, but the genies they summoned remained and became warped by the region's pervasive blightburn radiation. Now, these \"blightburn genies\" have bodies with features mirroring those of beasts that dwell in dark places, and their elemental lineages have been irreparably corrupted.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Shaitans corrupted by the Black Desert's blightburn become scorpion-like arardas. While other earth genies sparkle with the iridescence of gemstones and evoke the power of the earth itself, arardas use their connection to the ground to harness the might of electricity. Arardas are so infused with this radioactive crystal that their mere presence is toxic to most living creatures.</p>",
