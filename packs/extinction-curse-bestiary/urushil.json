Because of Lamashtu's prominence over other demonic deities, most pride demons encountered by mortals take female form, but they can be of any gender.</p>\n<p>Mariliths are among the greatest tacticians in the Abyss, and they have an almost supernatural knack for understanding the ripples of chaos and the unpredictable nature of demonic life. Their ability to command armies rises as much from their commanding presence as it does their ability to read into the potential results of any possible act and a sufficient understanding of the flow of entropy to allow them to predict likely outcomes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the Abyss, it can become a deadly fiend-a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin-be they classic sins like wrath or gluttony, or more \"specialized\" depravities like an obsession with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon's driving goals are twofold-the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin. In this way demons ensure a never-ending supply of new demons to bolster their ever-growing ranks in the Abyss.</p>",
