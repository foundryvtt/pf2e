Dousing the flames automatically extinguishes one or more sections of fire, with no check. Water typically clears a 5-foot square if the amount is small (such as that from <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Create Water]</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Hydraulic Push]</em>). Larger amounts of water, such as a full bucket, typically douse a 10-foot-by-10-foot area (or 4 squares in some other shape). Throwing a bucket of water on flames requires an Interact action. A waterskin doesn't contain enough water to put out even 1 square of fire. Cold can also put out fire, but only if the cold can affect an area; cold is usually less effective than water, so a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Frost Vial (Lesser)]{Frost Vial} typically puts out only 1 square of fire, and ray of frost is ineffective.</p>",
