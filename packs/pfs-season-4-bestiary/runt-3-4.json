The desert drake is the prairie drake's closest known relative, as both share a strong affinity for earth, can burrow through soil, and hack up balls of dirt that they aim at enemies. But whereas a desert drake is sleek and nimble, flying through lightning storms and siroccos with ease, the prairie drake has all the grace of a chicken, barely able to flutter clumsily up a low hill or over a boulder. Owing to their largely vestigial wings, it's no wonder prairie drakes prefer burrowing over soaring.</p>\n<p>The average prairie drake has a temperament similar to that of a wicked child who delights in tormenting others. They ambush tiny animals from underground and play with their food thoroughly before eating. To assert their supremacy over other scrubland predators, prairie drakes knock down their rivals and attack them mercilessly. They often make grisly displays from the corpses of their foes to intimidate other would-be competitors.</p>\n<p>Prairie drakes build and live in burrow mounds just beneath the surface of their environs. They make shallow tunnels in search of large insects, rodents, and ground snakes. Prairie drakes' presence helps to turn the topsoil and encourage new plant growth, supporting other animal life and making them a keystone species for the environment. Even their breath weapon leaves behind rich \"drake soil,\" coveted by farmers and gardeners for the potent effects it has on plants. Being seen as \"useful\" or \"beneficial\" annoys most prairie drakes, who believe such a reputation makes them look weak and conflicts with their \"apex predator\" mystique. After they've gotten too much positive attention, a prairie drake is apt to murder a farm animal or destroy croplands only to prove that they're far from harmless.</p>",
