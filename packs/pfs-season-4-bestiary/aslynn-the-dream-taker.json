These foul creatures collect souls in dark gems or crystalline jars to sell in fiendish markets, and are themselves empowered by potent magic jewels known as <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Heartstone]{Heartstones}</em>. They haunt the Ethereal Plane, where they prey upon mortals in their dreams, debilitating them with horrific nightmares as they rest. A night hag may find a particular target and haunt them continuously over the course of weeks, slowly and cruelly breaking down the victim's will and ability to resist, until their soul is forfeit.</p>\n<p>A night hag is a canny mastermind and soul broker, willing to consider any deal as long as she is convinced she has the upper hand. Although a night hag finds it easy to travel the Ethereal Plane and prey upon helpless souls that can't fight back, these souls are also the least desirable to the evil outsiders the night hag bargains with, and so a night hag gathers allies and minions that allow her to prey on more potent souls without personally risking herself. Their favored minions are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.Nightmare]{Nightmares}, with whom they share a special bond.</p>\n<p>Above all, night hags avoid fighting foes that can harry them on the Ethereal Plane, picking fights only when they are certain they can escape.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Malevolent crones who lurk at the edges of civilization, hags use their deceptive, magical abilities to prey upon humanoids, manipulating and corrupting them. Some say hags arose from fey that became twisted by their inner selfishness. Hags gather together in covens for greater power, craft unique magical items known as <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Hag Eye]{Hag Eyes}</em>, and are known to replace infant humanoids with their own offspring-these children are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.Changeling Exile]{Changelings} who have the potential to become hags themselves.</p>",
