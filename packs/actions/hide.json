The GM rolls your [[/act hide]] check in secret and compares the result to the Perception DC of each creature you're observed by but that you have cover or greater cover against or are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] from. You get a +2 circumstance bonus to your check if you have standard cover (or +4 from greater cover).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Success</strong> If the creature could see you, you're now @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] from it instead of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Observed]. If you were hidden from or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Undetected] by the creature, you retain that condition.</p>\n<p>If you successfully become hidden to a creature but then cease to have cover or greater cover against it or be concealed from it, you become observed again. You cease being hidden if you do anything except Hide, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sneak], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Step]. If you attempt to Strike a creature, the creature remains off-guard against that attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise. The GM might allow you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action without being noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check.</p>\n<p>If a creature uses @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] to make you observed by it, you must successfully Hide to become hidden from it again.</p>"
