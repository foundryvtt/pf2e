You make an Athletics check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Shove] an opponent within your reach using your weapon, then Interact to reload. For this Shove, you don't need a free hand, and you add the weapon's item bonus on attack rolls (if any) to the Athletics check. If your last action or activity this round included a ranged Strike with the weapon, use the same multiple attack penalty as the last Strike you attempted with the weapon for the Shove; the Shove still counts toward your multiple attack penalty on further attacks.</p>"
