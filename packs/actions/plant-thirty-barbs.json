If successful, barbs fill the target, dealing two die of weapon damage the first time the creature uses a move action on each of its turns; the barbs are made out of the same material as your weapon ikon and bypass resistances and such accordingly (for instance, a cold iron spear would create cold iron barbs). The barbs last for [[/gmr 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}. If the target dies while the barbs are still in their body, the barbs burst forth in a forest of thorns covering the creature's space, which are greater difficult terrain and deal piercing damage equal to half your level for each square that is moved into.</p>"
