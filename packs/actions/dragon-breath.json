If the dragon had a cone-shaped breath weapon, your breath weapon is a @Template[cone|distance:30]. If they had a line-shaped breath weapon, your breath weapon is a @Template[line|distance:60]. If they had a burst-shaped breath weapon, your breath weapon is a @Template[burst|distance:10] within 60 feet. No matter the shape, it deals @Damage[(@actor.level)d6|options:area-damage]{1d6 damage per level}, of the same damage type as the dragon's Breath Weapon, with a @Check[reflex|against:class-spell|basic|options:area-effect] save, using the higher of your class DC or spell DC. This action has the same traits as the breath weapon of the dragon you made the pact with.</p>"
