This second effect has the emotion, fear, and mental traits. The oppressing creature may end all the effects as a free action by truthfully agreeing to permanently end their oppression. Otherwise, your Ultimatum of Liberation has no duration, though you can have only one Ultimatum of Liberation active at a time. If you pronounce a second Ultimatum of Liberation, the effects of the first one end.</p>"
