Choose one creature, object, spell effect, hazard, or other impediment imposing any of those conditions on you. Attempt a check using your [[/act escape statistic=unarmed]]{unarmed attack modifier} against the DC of the effect. This is typically the Athletics DC of a creature grabbing you, the Thievery DC of a creature who tied you up, the spell DC for a spell effect, or the listed Escape DC of an object, hazard, or other impediment. You can attempt an [[/act escape statistic=acrobatics]]{Acrobatics} or [[/act escape statistic=athletics]]{Athletics} check instead of using your attack modifier if you choose (but this action still has the attack trait).</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You get free and remove the grabbed, immobilized, and restrained conditions imposed by your chosen target. You can then Stride up to 5 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You get free and remove the grabbed, immobilized, and restrained conditions imposed by your chosen target.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You don't get free, and you can't attempt to Escape again until your next turn.</p>"
