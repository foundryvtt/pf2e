The damage is of the type you selected when you gained your wand implement. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4.</p>\n<p>You can expend more energy than usual to boost the effect of Fling Magic, dealing @Damage[ceil(@actor.level/2)d6 +@actor.abilities.cha.mod[untyped]]{d6s of damage} instead of d4s. After you do so, the wand takes [[/r 1d4 #Recharge Wand]]{1d4 rounds} to recharge, during which you can't boost the wand's damage but can continue to Fling Magic normally. If you critically hit with a Strike, your wand recharges immediately as it draws in power from the clash.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> This activity has the trait corresponding to the damage type you selected.</p>"
