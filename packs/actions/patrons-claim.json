If the creature fails its save and takes damage, it is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 2} (or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 4} on a critical failure) and you regain 1 Focus Point, up to your usual maximum, as your patron grants you additional magic in exchange for your gift of your opponent's spirit.</p>"
