You must have the trained proficiency rank in a skill to use it to Identify Magic or Learn a Spell. Something without a specific tradition, such as an item with the magical trait, can be identified using any of these skills.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Magical Tradition</th>\n<th>Corresponding Skill</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcane</td>\n<td>Arcana</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Divine</td>\n<td>Religion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Occult</td>\n<td>Occultism</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Primal</td>\n<td>Nature</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have a spellcasting class feature, and the spell you want to learn is on your magical tradition's spell list.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can gain access to a new spell of your tradition from someone who knows that spell or from magical writing like a spellbook or scroll. If you can cast spells of multiple traditions, you can Learn a Spell of any of those traditions, but you must use the corresponding skill to do so. For example, if you were a cleric with the bard multiclass archetype, you couldn't use Religion to add an occult spell to your bardic spell repertoire.</p>\n<p>To learn the spell, you must do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 1 hour per spell rank, during which you must remain in conversation with a person who knows the spell or have the magical writing in your possession.</li>\n<li>Have materials with the Price indicated in the Learning a Spell table.</li>\n<li>Attempt a skill check for the skill corresponding to your tradition (DC determined by the GM, often close to the DC on the Learning a Spell Table). Uncommon or rare spells have higher DCs; full guidelines for the GM appear on page 52 of GM Core.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Learning a Spell</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Spell Rank</th>\n<th>Price</th>\n<th>Typical DC</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st or cantrip</td>\n<td>2 gp</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>6 gp</td>\n<td>18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>16 gp</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>36 gp</td>\n<td>23</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>70 gp</td>\n<td>26</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>140 gp</td>\n<td>28</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>300 gp</td>\n<td>31</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>650 gp</td>\n<td>34</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>1,500 gp</td>\n<td>36</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>7,000 gp</td>\n<td>41</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You expend half the materials and learn the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You expend the materials and learn the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to learn the spell but can try again after you gain a level.
