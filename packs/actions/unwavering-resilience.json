If you critically succeed at this saving throw, you become bolstered by your success; blossoms and new growth temporarily sprout all over your body, and you gain a number of temporary Hit Point equal to your level. These temporary Hit Points last for one minute. When there temporary Hit Points are lost, the verdant growth subsides.</p>"
