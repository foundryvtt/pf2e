Your Strikes deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier for 1 minute. After the Overdrive ends, your gizmos become unusable as they cool down or reset, and you can't use Overdrive for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Your gizmos go into overdrive, adding power to your attacks. As critical success, except the additional damage is equal to half your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> Your gizmos whine concerningly and begin to smoke. Your Strikes deal 1 additional fire damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Whoops! Something explodes. You take fire damage equal to half your level (rounded up), and you can't use Overdrive again for [[/r 1d4 #Recharge Overdrive]] rounds as your gizmos reset.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> When under the effects of Overdrive, you can still use the Overdrive action. You can't extend your Overdrive's duration this way, but you can turn an overdrive into a critical overdrive if you critically succeed. A failure has no effect on your current Overdrive, and you end your Overdrive on a critical failure.</p>"
