The hero gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and saving throws against the villain until the start of your next turn. If you Spin a Tale on your next turn, the story continues for another round, for a maximum of 10 rounds. While the tale continues, minor, crude illusions spring into being in your space; these are arcane illusion effects that have no mechanical impact other than illustrating your tale.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Item.Effect: Spin Tale]</p>"
