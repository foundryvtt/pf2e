All creatures adjacent to you take @Damage[(4d6+@actor.abilities.str.mod)[bludgeoning]]{4d6 bludgeoning damage plus your Strength modifier}; this increases to @Damage[(6d6+@actor.abilities.str.mod)[bludgeoning]]{6d6} if your firearm has a striking rune, @Damage[(8d6+@actor.abilities.str.mod)[bludgeoning]]{8d6} if it has a greater striking rune, and @Damage[(10d6+@actor.abilities.str.mod)[bludgeoning]]{10d6} if it has a major striking rune. This ability does not apply other effects that increase damage with your firearm Strikes such as weapon specialization. Creatures affected by this attack must attempt a @Check[reflex|against:gunslinger|basic] save. A creature that fails its save is also pushed 10 feet directly away from you.</p>"
