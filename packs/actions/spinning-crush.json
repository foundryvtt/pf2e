All creatures adjacent to you take [[/r (1d6+@actor.abilities.str.mod)[bludgeoning]]]{1d6 bludgeoning} damage plus your Strength modifier; this increases to [[/r (2d6+@actor.abilities.str.mod)[bludgeoning]]]{2d6} if your firearm has a striking rune, [[/r (3d6+@actor.abilities.str.mod)[bludgeoning]]]{3d6} if it has a greater striking rune, and [[/r (4d6+@actor.abilities.str.mod)[bludgeoning]]]{4d6} if it has a major striking rune. This ability does not apply other effects that increase damage with your firearm Strikes such as weapon specialization. Creatures affected by this attack must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classDC.value)|basic:true] save. A creature that fails its save is also pushed 5 feet directly away from you.</p>"
