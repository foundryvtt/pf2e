The piece played depends on whether the trigger was a Strike or Spell, and it applies to the triggering Strike or Spell, except where noted otherwise.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Distracting Cacophony</strong> The trigger is a spell. You create a musical crash of sonic energy that assails the target and breaks its concentration. The target must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:resolve(@actor.system.proficiencies.classDCs.thaumaturge.value)] save against your class DC or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} until the end of your next turn (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 2} on a critical failure). The target doesn't have to attempt a flat check to avoid losing the triggering spell, but the discordant ring does lower the spell attack roll or spell DC of the triggering spell from stupefied.</li>\n<li><strong>Disrupting Harmony</strong> The trigger is a Strike. You create a strangely discordant harmony that sinks into your foe's mind and throws its movements off. The target must succeed at a Will save against your class DC or become your choice of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1} until the end of your next turn (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 2} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 2} on a critical failure).</li>\n</ul>"
