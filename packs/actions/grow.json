            "value": "<p>You can grow an item from a living thing, most commonly a plant. You need the Alchemical Crafting skill feat to Grow an alchemical item, the Magical Crafting skill feat to Grow a magic item, and the Snare Crafting feat to Grow a snare. To Grow an item, you must meet the following requirements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is your level or lower. An item that doesn't list a level is level 0. If the item is 9th level or higher, you must be a master in Crafting, and if it's 16th or higher, you must be legendary.</li>\n<li>You have the formula for the item; see Getting Formulas for more information.</li>\n<li>You have an appropriate set of tools for growing the item. While cultivation and gardening tools are typical for plants, you might also use a different technique that requires a different set of tools. For instance, if you play music to help your plants grow, you might use a musical instrument instead.</li>\n<li>You must supply special fertilizers or other magical nutrients worth at least half the item's Price. You always expend at least that quantity of fertilizers and magical nutrients when you Grow successfully. If you're in a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get the amount of magical nutrients you need, except in the case of rarer precious materials. You can also bring them with you in advance or forage for them with a skill like Herbalism Lore, gaining an amount of value based on the rules for @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Earn Income].</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You must spend 4 days at work, at which point you attempt a Crafting check. The GM determines the DC to Grow the item based on its level, rarity, and other circumstances. Depending on the specifics of the type of item, it might be easier to Grow than it is to Craft, or vice versa; typically, the GM can represent that by making an easy or hard DC adjustment.</p>\n<p>If your attempt to create the item is successful, you expend the fertilizers and other magical nutrients you supplied. You can pay the remaining portion of the item's Price in additional growth accelerants to complete the item immediately, or you can spend additional downtime days cultivating the item. For each additional day taken, reduce the value of the accelerants you need to complete the item. This amount is determined using Core Rulebook Table 4â€“2: Income Earned, based on your proficiency rank in Crafting and using your own level instead of a task level. After any of these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending the remaining portion of its Price in accelerants. If the downtime days you spend are interrupted, you can return to finish the item later, continuing where you left off.</p>\n<p>You also have the option to allow the item to grow mostly untended, only stopping to supervise it occasionally, though the pace is much slower without your direct intervention. At the end of each season in which you spent at least 1 day of downtime to Grow the item, roll an additional Crafting check and reduce the value of accelerants you need to expend to complete the item by the corresponding amount.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent Growing reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level + 1 and your proficiency rank in Crafting.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent Growing reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level and your proficiency rank.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to complete the item. You can salvage the raw materials you supplied for their full value. If you want to try again, you must start over.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You fail to complete the item. You ruin 10% of the fertilizers and nutrients you supplied, but you can salvage the rest. If you want to try again, you must start over.</p>"
