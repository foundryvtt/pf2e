If you are currently taking persistent fire or acid damage, you immediately end the effect. Until the beginning of your next turn, you shed bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) like a torch. The next time you are dealt damage by an enemy before the beginning of your next turn, you shed glowing ichor in a square adjacent to you, and where it hits the earth, a glowing, thorned herb grows. A creature other than you can pluck and consume the herb with an Interact action to regain a number of Hit Points equal to half of the damage you were dealt by the attack that sprouted the herb.</p>"
