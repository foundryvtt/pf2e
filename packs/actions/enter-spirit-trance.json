You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. The trance lasts for 1 minute, until you fall @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious], or until you Dismiss it, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p>While in this trance, you gain a +1 status bonus to Fortitude and Will saving throws and your melee Strikes deal 1 additional spirit damage. Other abilities may require you to be in a spirit trance. When the trace ends, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Enter Spirit Trance, and you can't Enter a Spirit Trance for 1 minute.</p>"
