If the triggering effect was targeted, it targets you instead of the triggering creature. If it was an area effect, it leaps from the triggering creature's space to fill your space instead. This doesn't divert lightning from any other creatures targeted by or in the area of the lightning. You're automatically hit by or automatically fail your save against the effect. You then can't Divert Lightning for [[/r 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>"
