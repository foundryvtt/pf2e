You can voluntarily end your trance by taking a single action, which has a concentrate trait, and succeeding at a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] save against your own class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Once your trance ends, you can't enter a Daydream Trance again for 1 minute. While you're in your trance, you gain the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain a +1 status bonus to Will saves. This bonus increases to +2 against mental effects. If you're legendary in Occultism, the bonus against mental effects increases to +3.</li>\n<li>You take a -1 penalty to Perception checks and initiative rolls.</li>\n</ul>"
