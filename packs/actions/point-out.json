That creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] to your allies, rather than @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Undetected]. This works only for allies who can see you and are in a position where they could potentially detect the target. If your allies can't hear or understand you, they must succeed at a Perception check against the creature's Stealth DC or they misunderstand and believe the target is in a different location.</p>"
