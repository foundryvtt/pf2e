If you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Swift Sneak] feat, you can move at full Speed rather than half, but you still can't use another exploration activity while you do so. If you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Legendary Sneak] feat, you can move at full Speed and use a second exploration activity. If you're Avoiding Notice at the start of an encounter, you usually roll a Stealth check instead of a Perception check both to determine your initiative and to see if the enemies notice you (based on their Perception DCs, as normal for Sneak, regardless of their initiative check results).</p>"
