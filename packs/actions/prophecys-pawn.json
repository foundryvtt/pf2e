You must use the result of the second roll.</p>\n<p>For 24 hours afterward, the GM can force you to reroll a successful saving throw, attack roll, or skill check as fate balances the scale. This is a misfortune effect. You can't use prophecy's pawn again until the GM uses this option or 24 hours pass, whichever comes first.</p>"
