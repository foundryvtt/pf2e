Your eidolon must remain within 100 feet of you at all times and can't willingly go beyond that limit. If forced beyond this distance, or if you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, your eidolon's physical form dissolves: your eidolon unmanifests, and you need to use Manifest Eidolon to manifest it again.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> This activity has the trait matching your eidolon's tradition (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).</p>"
