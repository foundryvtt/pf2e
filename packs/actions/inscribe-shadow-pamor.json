If your next action is to Strike, the shadows cling to your foe with your attack, obscuring its vision. On a hit, the target of your Strike becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] until the start of your next turn. The target can use an Interact action to tear away the clinging shadows and remove the dazzled condition. On a critical hit, the shadows are particularly stubborn and can't be torn away.</p>"
