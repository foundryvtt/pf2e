Typically, this spell is a cantrip that you want to have in effect in the event a combat breaks out, and it must be one you can cast in 2 actions or fewer. In order to prevent fatigue due to repeated casting, you'll likely use this activity only when something out of the ordinary occurs.</p>\n<p>You can instead use this activity to continue @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sustain a Spell] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sustain an Activation] with a sustained duration. Most such spells or item effects can be sustained for 10 minutes, though some specify they can be sustained for a different duration.</p>"
