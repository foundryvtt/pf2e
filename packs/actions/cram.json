You Study twice, each in a branch that satisfies the activity requirements. However, the extra studying comes at a price. Until the next time you take the Study downtime activity, you're particularly tired from all the extra hours cramming; at the start of each day of adventuring, you must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:8] check or be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fatigued] for that day.</p>"
