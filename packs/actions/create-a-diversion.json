Whether or not you succeed, creatures you attempt to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their Perception DCs against your attempts to Create a Diversion for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] to each creature whose Perception DC is less than or equal to your result. (The hidden condition allows you to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sneak] away.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except Step or use the Stealth skill to Hide or Sneak. If you Strike a creature, the creature remains @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] against that attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You don't divert the attention of any creatures whose Perception DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are aware you were trying to trick them.</p>"
