For 1 minute, that enemy deals an additional 10 spirit damage to you with each successful Strike or spell it targets you with. Whenever that enemy deals spirit damage to you, each ally who has the enemy in melee reach can attempt a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Reactive Strike] against it, even if the ally doesn't normally have that reaction. If an ally successfully slays the enemy with a Reactive Strike due to this effect, that ally immediately gains temporary Hit Points equal to your level, which persist for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Item.Effect: A Challenge for Heroes]</p>"
