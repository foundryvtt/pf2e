If a creature is both dying and bleeding, choose which ailment you're trying to treat before you roll.

The DC is equal to 5 + that creature's recovery roll DC (typically 15 + its dying value).</li>\n<li><strong>Stop Bleeding</strong> Attempt a <span data-pf2-action=\"administerFirstAid\" data-pf2-variant=\"stop-bleeding\" data-pf2-glyph=\"D\">Medicine</span> check on a creature that is taking persistent bleed damage, giving them a chance to make another flat check to remove the persistent damage. The DC is usually the DC of the effect that caused the bleed.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Success</strong> If you're trying to stabilize, the creature loses the dying condition (but remains @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious]). If you're trying to stop bleeding, the creature attempts a flat check to end the bleeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> If you were trying to stabilize, the creature's dying value increases by 1. If you were trying to stop bleeding, it immediately takes an amount of damage equal to its persistent bleed damage.</p>"
