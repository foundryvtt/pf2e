The DC is equal to 5 + that creature's recovery roll DC (typically 15 + its dying value).</li>\n<li><strong>Stop Bleeding</strong> Attempt a <span data-pf2-action=\"administerFirstAid\" data-pf2-variant=\"stop-bleeding\" data-pf2-glyph=\"D\">Medicine</span> check on a creature that is taking persistent bleed damage. The DC is usually the DC of the effect that caused the bleed.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Success</strong> If you're trying to stabilize, the target loses the dying condition (but remains @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious]). If you're trying to stop bleeding, the target benefits from an assisted recovery with the lowered DC for particularly appropriate help.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> If you were trying to stabilize, the target's dying value increases by 1. If you were trying to stop bleeding, the target immediately takes an amount of damage equal to its persistent bleed damage.</p>"
