The only manipulate actions you can take are to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Cast a Spell] with somatic components, weave silk or webbing, or simple @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Interact] actions such as opening an unlocked door. Your spider legs can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish. The GM might determine other manipulate actions are appropriate for your spider legs.</p>"
