Make two thrown Strikes against a target within the first range increment of both your weapon ikons. This counts as two attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both attacks. The target is flanked for both attacks (typically making it @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] against both attacks). If both Strikes hit, the target also takes an additional die of weapon damage. The weapons then return to your hand.</p>"
