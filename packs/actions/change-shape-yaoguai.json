This form is the same apparent age and body type as your yaoguai form and has roughly analogous physical traits, such as hair color. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception. You can remain in your humanoid form indefinitely, but you revert to your yaoguai form after 1 hour of unconsciousness or 1 minute after death.</p>"
