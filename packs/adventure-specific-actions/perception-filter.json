For the next 10 minutes, a creature that enters a @Template[type:emanation|distance:120], centered on you, must attempt a secret @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)|traits:secret] save, after which the creature is then temporarily immune for 1 day.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes a â€“2 status penalty to Perception checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] or otherwise detect you.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You filter all of the creature's senses, making it difficult for it to notice you. When you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] or undetected from the creature, it doesn't observe you as soon as you do anything other than @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Hide], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sneak], or Step. If it rolls a Perception check to Seek or otherwise detect you, it gets the outcome one degree of success worse than what it rolled, and if you roll a Stealth check to Hide, Sneak, or otherwise escape its attention, you get the outcome one degree of success better than what you rolled against the creature. If you use a hostile action toward the creature, the effect ends for that creature after your hostile action is completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the effect doesn't end for that creature if you use a hostile action against it.</p>"
