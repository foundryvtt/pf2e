The fire wisp doesn't act in combat, but it can assist you while you Craft items. You gain a +1 bonus to Crafting checks involving blacksmithing and general metalworking, increasing to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 17th level. Once per day, when you roll a critical failure on a Crafting check related to blacksmithing, you get a failure instead. The wisp replaces the need for a forge while blacksmithing, but you still require other equipment and tools. The wisp remains for up to 10 minutes or until you Dismiss it. You can extend this duration by an additional 10 minutes if you feed the wisp one light Bulk worth of charcoal or firewood, or one pint of oil.</p>"
