A character can attempt to interpret these clues with a Perception, Society, or Survival check-the DC remains 36 regardless of the check used to interpret the clues. This DC is reduced by 2 for each Hidden Forge clue possessed beyond the first. Thus, if the character has access to two Hidden Forge Clues, the DC is reduced to 34, up to a maximum reduction to DC 22 if a character has 8 Hidden Forge Clues.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The PC pinpoints the entrance to the Hidden Forge.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The PC makes significant progress toward determining the Hidden Forge's location, and gains a +4 circumstance bonus on their next check to Seek the Hidden Forge.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The PC fails to determine anything informative from the clues.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the Droskar cultists catch wind of the investigation and are able to prepare their defenses.</p>"
