You use the following ability, which you must have gained access to from the original team.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You gain a sense for the supernatural and the flow of fate. For 1 hour, you gain spiritsense as a precise sense with a range of 60 feet. Spiritsense enables you to sense the spirits of creatures, including living creatures, most non-mindless undead, and haunts within the listed range. As with your hearing and other imprecise senses, you still need to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] to locate an undetected creature. As spiritsense detects spiritual essence, not physical bodies, it can detect spirits projected by spells such as project image or possessing otherwise soulless objects. It can't detect soulless bodies, constructs, or objects. Once during the spell's duration, when you roll a failure or critical failure on a saving throw or skill check, you get a success instead.</p>"
