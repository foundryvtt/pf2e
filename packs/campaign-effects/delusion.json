However, the metaphysical distance between the spirit world and that of the living distorts how these figments appear to living viewers. To undead, and to creatures with illusion-piercing abilities such as true seeing, the images appear as you intend for them to. To other observers, these illusions always take on a macabre tone. Blood, bone, and shadow replace more mundane materials in the composition. Speech is warped to resemble either shrill screams or low-pitched growls and is generally unintelligible. You gain a +2 status bonus to Deception checks.</p>\n<p>Once per day, you can cast one of the following spells as a 5th-rank innate occult spell: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mirage], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Illusory Creature], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Illusory Object].</p>"
