            "gm": "<h2>Soul Degradation (Curse 7)</h2>\n<section class=\"traits\">\n<p>rare</p>\n<p>curse</p>\n<p>magical</p>\n</section>\n<p>The PC's sense of self becomes subsumed by ghostly desires, eventually rendering them a senseless shell. Soul degradation doesn't increase or decrease its stage over the passage of time. Instead, each time a transmigrated PC recovers from the dying condition, they must attempt a new saving throw against this curse. Certain events or effects that the PCs might encounter in Chapter 3 of this adventure can also force them to save against soul degradation. Once the effects of transmigration end for a PC, they immediately and fully recover from soul degradation.</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> @Check[type:will|dc:23|traits:curse,magical]</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> weakness 5 to positive damage</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> weakness 10 to positive damage</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong> weakness 10 to positive damage, and each time the PC critically fails an attack roll or skill check they're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 1} as their mind obsesses over the failure</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 4</strong> as stage 3</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 5</strong> as stage 3</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 6</strong> The PC is reduced to an unthinking haunt. Until the curse is removed or the duration of the transmigrate ritual ends, they repeat a short loop of actions and are no longer under the control of the player (unlimited duration).</p>",
            "value": "<p>When the PCs @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Transmigrate] into the living world during the third chapter of this adventure, they're ectoplasmic beings trapped somewhere between life and undeath. While in this state, the PCs function mostly normally, but appear as semi-solid ectoplasmic versions of themselves. They aren't quite transparent, but their solid bodies seem to waver and shimmer along the edges, giving them an eerie, unsettling appearance. While in this state, they're living creatures but gain some of the following abilities similar to those shared by undead creatures. As living creatures more akin to phantoms, they remain susceptible to negative damage and are healed by positive energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Undead Vision:</strong> They gain low-light vision, or darkvision if their ancestry already has low-light vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Transmigrated Survival:</strong> A PC in this state never gains the wounded condition, but instead becomes exposed to soul degradation upon recovering from the dying condition (see below). If a PC dies while transmigrated, they awaken, alive, in the Willowshore mindscape and gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed]{Doomed 1} condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Transmigrated Protection:</strong> They gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws (or any other defense) against disease, poison, sleep, and any effects that would impose the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Paralyzed] condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Spirit Powers:</strong> While in this state, the PCs can also interact with the living world via their newfound spirit powers. When the PCs manifest their transmigrated bodies in the living world, they each gain two minor spirit powers and one major spirit power from the spirit powers listed below. Every time the PCs do their daily preparations, they can reselect their chosen spirit powers. When a spirit power calls for a saving throw, use the higher of that PC's class DC or spell DC. Any spirit powers calling for attack rolls use this DC â€“ 10. Use the PC's own level for determining the effects of any counteract checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Soul Degradation:</strong> Initially, PCs will likely revel in their newfound spirit powers. Whenever a transmigrated PC comes close to death, however, they risk losing themselves entirely to their ghostly nature. Each time a dying transmigrated PC would normally gain the wounded condition, they're instead exposed to soul degradation and must attempt a new saving throw to resist increasing the stage of this curse.</p>\n<h3>Minor Spirit Powers</h3>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Curiosity]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Delusion]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Duty]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Love]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Obsession]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Passion]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Spite]</p>\n<h3>Major Spirit Powers</h3>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Chilling Paralysis]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Dematerialize]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Flickering Figure]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Flight]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Grudge]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Resist Death]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.River's Reflection]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Sap Life]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.campaign-effects.Item.Undying Flesh]</p>"
