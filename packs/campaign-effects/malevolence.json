Malevolence is a special condition that can affect PCs who play in this adventure. The malevolence condition always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value to all saving throws against effects generated by haunts and against all curse and possession effects. The malevolence condition can be reduced by restoration.</p>\n<p>The malevolence can never increase above a value of 4. If an effect would increase a creature's malevolence value higher than 4, the creature is instead @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 24 hours as the malevolence consumes a few of their random, short-term memories. A creature that has a malevolence 4 won't voluntarily leave the Xarwin Manor grounds.</p>\n<p>Each time you get a full night's rest in a region not influenced by the malevolence condition, the value of your malevolence decreases by 1.</p>"
