That creature sees your expression suddenly transform into a supernaturally distorted visage of hatred, and must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] save. Since this perception of your hatred is all perceived directly in the target's mind, it does not have the visual traitâ€”if the target can't see you, your hatred manifests in different ways that the target will have no problem observing. Perhaps your voice manifests as a sinister whisper in their ears, or maybe you flood them with a scent that invokes a horrific memory. The creature is then immune to Grudge for 24 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 1}</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 2}, falls @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone] from the shock, and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fleeing] as long as it remains frightened.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature faints from fear, becoming @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious].
