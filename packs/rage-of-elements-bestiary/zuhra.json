Despite their large personalities, their long-term relationships tend to be cool and somewhat distant; zuhras often make alliances but rarely form friendships, and the trust required for deeper relationships is rarer still. The few mortals who've gotten to know a zuhra often describe them as bombastic but emotionally aloof.</p>\n<p>Since the reconnection with other planes, zuhras have sought out and formed bonds with other genies. They find their jabali cousins to be capable smithing partners, if a bit staid and dull. Zuhras rarely pay non-genie elementals any more than a passing glance, finding even the intelligent ones uninteresting to communicate with or hard to relate to.</p>",
