These master crafters of wood specialize in carpentry and all kinds of woodcarving, and they take a particular delight in reshaping the world in their own image—either through creating wooden statues of themselves or by manipulating and controlling the living things around them. Though they're able to carve themselves similarly, they usually regard their own forms as perfect.</p>\n<p>Shunning the company of other genies, they prefer to avoid those equal in power and instead surround themselves with circles of sycophants and flatterers. With the pathways to the Universe open again for the first time in ages, kizidhars roam the multiverse to find mortals they can tempt into joining their palace retinues as servants, entertainers, and valuable sources of new information.</p>",
