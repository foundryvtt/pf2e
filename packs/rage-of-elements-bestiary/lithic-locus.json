Unlike with the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Illusory Creature] spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mirage] spell.</p>\n<p>When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches any part of the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. If they interact with a portion of the illusion, they disbelieve only that portion. They disbelieve the entire scene only on a critical success.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> Creatures or objects in your scene can speak.

Some excavated sites might still hold a sliver of consciousness in their base materials, which walks again as an avatar of an extinct people when awakened. These lithic loci represent the triumphs and folly of their society. Speaking to one is speaking to a witness of an archaic time. The lithic locus's persona expresses their culture in all dimensions, and thus the attitudes of lithic loci vary greatly. Their appearances show the aesthetics and technology of their time, suspended in a cloud of excavated earth.</p>\n<p>As plentiful as archaeological sites are in the Universe, the Plane of Earth holds countless more of far older provenance. Some of its inhabitants have even found lithic loci from peoples far older than themselves, seeing directly what would remain should they dwindle out of living memory. This has led some civilizations to even plan their decline by leaving a legacy in the living rock.</p>\n<h2>Ancient Finds</h2>\n<p>Lithic loci often contain important and valuable items. None of these elemental constructs are likely to agree to be looted, but some loci bestow their antiquities upon worthy successors, proud to see their culture's creations put to effective use in the modern day. Lithic loci can also direct earnest seekers to other lost treasures, helping to restore knowledge of an extinct society.</p>",
