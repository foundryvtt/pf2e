This versatility has led to gylous becoming widespread throughout all layers of Hell, enabling them to filter key information to their masters regarding other devils' plots and schemes. Their allegiance is no secret, but their skills are so great that powerful devils employ one or more gylous regardless. While most gylous have a feminine form (combined with their role, this is the source of their common moniker of \"handmaiden\"), some have other gender presentations, and nearly all gylous take on carefully cultivated illusions to best suit the roles they fill. More often than not, gylous arise when lesser devils who have demonstrated exceptional utility and invaluable skills are uplifted into a new form, though on rare occasions they are shaped from the souls of evil mortals who showed unparalleled savvy within bureaucratic enterprises.</p>",
