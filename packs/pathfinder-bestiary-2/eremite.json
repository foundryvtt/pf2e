                    "value": "<p>You perform a ritual to imprison a creature in one of several forms. While some versions of this ritual offer all of the forms, others include only a single form or only a few of them. Whichever form you use, the effect can't be counteracted, though it can be ended by @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Freedom]. Some forms of <em>imprisonment</em> can be ended by other means. Because the ritual requires the target to remain within 10 feet at all times, it typically requires you to subdue the target first.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chains</strong> You bind the creature with chains, rendering it unable to use any actions other than to speak. Other creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains, or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The chains have Hardness equal to 5 × the <em>imprisonment</em> ritual's spell rank, and double that many Hit Points. Destroying the chains frees the target.</li>\n<li><strong>Object (9th level or higher)</strong> You either shrink the creature to an inch in height or transform it into an insubstantial form whose body trails away into wisps below its head. Either way, you trap it inside a gem, jar, bottle, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its surroundings and can move within the container and speak, but it can't use any other actions. Destroying the container kills the target rather than freeing it. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also transmutation magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Oubliette (10th level only)</strong> You entomb the target in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so that it can't be reached by any means. You also prevent divinations from revealing the location where the <em>imprisonment</em> occurred. Powerful magic such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wish] can reveal the location of the imprisonment, but even such magic can't free the target from the oubliette; only a 10th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Freedom] ritual can do so.</li>\n<li><strong>Prison</strong> You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature's prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.</li>\n<li><strong>Slumber (sleep effect)</strong> You put the creature into an eternal sleep. It ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target-whether romantically, filially, or otherwise-frees it from the slumber. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also enchantment magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Temporal Stasis</strong> You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn't grow older and can't be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends. Unlike other forms of <em>imprisonment</em>, temporal stasis can be counteracted by a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Dispel Magic] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Haste] spell. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also transmutation magic.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You imprison the target. You can either use a form of <em>imprisonment</em> that usually requires 1 additional spell rank, or give any creatures trying to use a <em>freedom</em> ritual to rescue the target a -2 circumstance penalty to checks associated with that ritual.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You imprison the target.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to imprison the target.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You imprison yourself and the secondary casters in the same way you intended to imprison the target.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> You can use the object form of <em>imprisonment</em> in addition to the other options, and you can target a creature of up to 18th level. The base cost increases to 2,000 gp.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> You can use the object and oubliette forms of <em>imprisonment</em> in addition to the other options, and you can target a creature of up to 20th level. The base cost increases to 6,000 gp.</p>"

While the tuning forks for most prominent planes are uncommon, just like the spell plane shift, more obscure planes and demiplanes often have rare tuning forks. The spell is highly imprecise, and you appear 1d20x25 miles from the last place one of the targets (of your choice) was located the last time that target traveled to the plane. If it's the first time traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you appear at a random location on the plane. Plane shift doesn't provide a means of return travel, though casting plane shift again allows you to return to your previous plane unless there are extenuating circumstances.</p>"

An eremite might attach tongues to their hand as extra fingers or a fist to the back of their neck in a horrid \"improvement.\" Eremites average 7 feet tall and weigh approximately 200 pounds.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The search for ultimate sensation through self-mutilation is the horrifying preoccupation of the shadow-dwelling fiends known as velstracs. They transcend their stoic detachment only when inflicting pain and terror upon their victims, practicing new forms of torture, or when turning their agonizing practices back on themselves. Velstracs consider themselves enlightened beings, transcending such limitations as morality or mortal taboos, but their victims know them as emotionless tormentors who inflict sadistic suffering. These fiends claim to seek perfection in thought, form, and action, although they don't recognize any refinement that doesn't require the painful excision of the flesh or spirit.</p>\n<p>Velstracs manifest from the souls of the most extreme masochistic or sadistic mortals who are judged and sent on to the Shadow Plane. They take on forms that suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the maestros of suffering and mutilation called eremites. The process of transformation warps the soul step by step, with other velstracs conveying their new members through untold chambers of pain among the dark reaches of the Shadow Plane.</p>",
