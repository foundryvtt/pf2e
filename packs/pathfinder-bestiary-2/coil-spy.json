These serpentfolk often identify as members of a sinister society known as the Coils of Ydersius, and the most devoted of their number seek out methods of reincarnating into new forms to even more efficiently infiltrate enemy societies. But before such agents take this extreme step, they must prove themselves as Coil spies. These serpentfolk train in methods of infiltrating other societies to such an extent that they might be capable of infiltrating a mammalian civilization for years. Though they're expected to work entirely toward the eventual triumph of their people, most Coil spies also find personal pursuits to keep them occupied in the shorter term. When Coil spies get caught, it's rarely due to a lack of pure skill, but rather to their arrogance or recklessness as they pursue their hedonistic desires.</p>",
