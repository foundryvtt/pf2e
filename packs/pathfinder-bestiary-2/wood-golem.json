It's less common for wood golems to have artistic embellishments such as engraved patterns, or to be carved in the shapes of different types of creatures to meet the tastes of their owners. While wealthy patrons have been known to commission wood golems to be painstakingly carved to resemble themselves or their ancestors, to serve dual purposes of protection and ego bolstering, most wood golem crafters don't bother. Druids and creatures who protect woodlands, such as arboreals, typically see wood golems as an affront or an abomination, akin to the horror humanoids often feel when facing a carrion or flesh golem. As a result, it is rare to see such creatures serving as guardians for fey or druidic holy sites, despite the thematic match between the wood golem's appearance and such locations.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The shape and structure of a golem are limited only by the power and creativity of its crafter. Over the ages, skilled minds and hands have refined the formulas for creating specific types of golems, resulting in the development of common forms. The secrets of creating the types of golems presented here may be guarded within the halls of famous golemworks or the forgotten libraries of many worlds.</p>",
