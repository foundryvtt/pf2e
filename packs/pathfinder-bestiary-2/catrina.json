Catrinas meet these souls, helping to convince them of the finality of their fate to ease a spirit's passing. Catrinas are more likely to intervene when a mortal can't accept their death. They perform their task to keep the afterlife calm, rather than out of true compassion for a mortal's grief. Catrinas only rarely visit the Material Plane, typically to help an extremely important mortal pass on.</p>\n<p>Catrinas resemble skeletons dressed in bright flowers and colorful dresses, giving them a simultaneously festive and macabre appearance. Though most catrinas present as feminine, masculine catrinas still dress in bright colors and carry garlands of flowers.</p>",
