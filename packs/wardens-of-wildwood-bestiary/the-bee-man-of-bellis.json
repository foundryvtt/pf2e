A <em>geas</em> to perform an act is usually conditional, such as, \"Always offer hospitality to strangers seeking a place to stay.\" An unconditional <em>geas</em> to perform a certain act doesn't require the target to perform that act exclusively, though it must prioritize the task above all leisurely pursuits. The most common <em>geas</em> to refrain from carrying out an act is a specification to avoid violating a contract. In those cases, the secondary caster usually takes charge of making sure the wording of the contract is attuned correctly with the ritual's magic. Because the target is willing, <em>geas</em> can have a duration that lasts for as long as the target agrees to. If the target is unable to fulfill the <em>geas</em>, it becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1}, and the sickened condition increases by 1 for each consecutive day it is prevented from following the <em>geas</em>, to a maximum of sickened 4. The sickened condition ends immediately when it follows the <em>geas</em> again; it can't remove the sickened condition in any other way. Only powerful magic such as a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wish] ritual can remove the effects of <em>geas</em> from a willing target.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The <em>geas</em> succeeds, and the target receives a +1 status bonus to skill checks that directly uphold the <em>geas</em> (at the GM's discretion).</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The <em>geas</em> succeeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The <em>geas</em> fails.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The <em>geas</em> fails, and you are instead affected by the <em>geas</em> you were attempting to place on the target.

If the target fails this Will save, the <em>geas</em> lasts up to 1 week. A <em>cleanse affliction</em> spell can counteract a <em>geas</em> on an unwilling creature, in addition to powerful magic such as a <em>wish</em> ritual. A clever unwilling creature can subvert the <em>geas</em> by contriving situations that prevent it from complying, but in that case it becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened] (as described above).</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> As 5th rank, but the <em>geas</em> lasts for up to 1 year on an unwilling creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> As 5th rank, but the <em>geas</em> lasts for a duration you choose (even unlimited) on an unwilling creature.</p>"

Precisely how he started down the sinister path that made him what he is today remains unknown, but it is generally understood that Vernon came to a strange revelation one day: he saw in his bees the ability to divine the future beyond that of any mortal magic and became convinced that if only he could teach himself to hear the messages in their buzzing and interpret the patterns in their swarms, that power could be his as well. His curiosity became an obsession, and obsession quickly spiraled into madness, culminating in the fateful day that he sacrificed his humanity in some inscrutable honeyed rite to become fully one with his beloved bees.</p>\n<p>To this day, they say, the Bee-Man still haunts the woods outside Bellis, waiting for someone to call him by speaking his name aloud. He often appears to those who seek his aid, although he seldom if ever grants it without exacting some terrible price in return.</p>\n<h2>Swarm Dispersion</h2>\n<p>If the Bee-Man is reduced to 0 Hit Points, his physical body dissolves into a cloud of live bees, which immediately scatter in all directions. Legends vary on the length of time that must pass before the Bee-Man can return, as well as on whether it's possible to permanently destroy him by killing every one of the bees before they can escape.</p>",
