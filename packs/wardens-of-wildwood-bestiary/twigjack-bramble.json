Religious fanaticism is another common factor; notably, however, twigjacks rarely worship established deities and instead devote themselves to strange new gods of their own imagining who, inevitably, demand that their worshippers purge the twigjacks' territory of those whose presence displeases them.</p>\n<h2>Proactive Vigilantes</h2>\n<p>Twigjacks frequently justify their violent and antisocial tendencies by declaring themselves the guardians of the forests in which they dwell, and that their duty is to keep those protected lands free of non-fey intruders by any means necessary. Rarely patient enough to wait for opportunities to come to them, roving brambles of twigjacks often seek out what they consider to be impending conflicts between forest-folk and outside threats in order to impose their \"assistance,\" nearly always resulting in brutality and bloodshed that benefits neither side and only serves to escalate the situation.</p>",
