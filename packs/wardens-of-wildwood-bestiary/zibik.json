The GM might decide a wish draws the attention of deities or other powerful creatures, leading to interference with the ritual or attempts to undo the wish. The power of the ritual alters reality to such a degree that even deities can't outright undo the wish, but they can react to the wish by sending servitors to take away the newly acquired riches, for example.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The wish is granted without complication or drawbacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The wish is granted, but with unintended consequences or side effects, such as taking riches from a well-known criminal, stirring a damaged kingdom to war, or angering rival gods.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The wish fails and has no result. The GM can instead have the wish be partially granted, but to such a lesser degree that the target will be eternally unsatisfied.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The wish is corrupted, resulting in a cruel fulfillment.

When a forest or other woodland terrain generates enough nature spirits, beings of the same sort of vital essence that embodies leshys or answers the call of a commune with nature, they naturally coalesce together and apotheosize into a green man. Green men aren't concerned with all the multifarious processes of nature like Gozreh or many other nature deities. Instead, they focus nearly all their attention on the plants of their home, only concerning themselves with animals, minerals, and the like insomuch as they affect the plants. Despite their name, green men aren't necessarily male; as creatures of pure natural power, to many of them, the concept of gender holds no meaning, and to those that do, they can be of any gender.</p>\n<p>Most green men are neutral and tend to ignore \"animals,\" which to them include sapient creatures such as humans. However, good and evil green men do exist. These individuals are far more likely to attempt to spread their influence far and wide, either for good or ill. Good green men provide succor to all that come within their home, not only to plants, providing wisdom like a nurturing parent. Evil green men, however, allow rare and dangerous plants to thrive in their domains by spreading fear and devastation to all those who might threaten plant life, though they might keep a few animals around to hunt for sport.</p>",
