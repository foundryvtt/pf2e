If a creature has no spells or magic items, the mana whorl is merely difficult terrain. A creature caught in a mana whorl can attempt a @Check[type:athletics|dc:23] check to Swim to either raise itself by one step if submerged to the neck or worse, or to move 5 feet if submerged only to the waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down by one step. A creature that Swims out of the whorl escapes the hazard and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone] in a space adjacent to the whorl. Other creatures can Aid the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid, or attempt to pull the creature out with their own @Check[type:athletics|dc:23] check, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check. If a creature has only magic items and no ability to cast spells, dropping all the items releases that creature, and it can move through the mana whorl as normal difficult terrain.</p>"
