In the eons since these empires collapsed, rune giants have persisted as a people of their own, though to the outside world they're little more than fabled horrors whispered of late at night by superstitious giants. Rune giants usually dwell in the most remote and rugged of towering mountain ranges, but they can also be found in immense ruins atop lost islands, glacial valleys, or even more remote or magical regions.</p>\n<p>Rune giants' striking charcoal flesh is decorated by dozens of runes, which are potent manifestations of their eldritch powers.
