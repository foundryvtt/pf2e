A creature needs to attempt only one save during the cyclone's movement, even if the cyclone moves over its space more than once.

A creature grabbed by the cyclone moves along with the cyclone and takes [[/r (1d10+6)[negative]]] damage at their beginning of its turn, and it must attempt a Reflex save against the cyclone on the cyclone's turn, no matter where the cyclone moves. A creature that successfully Escapes from the cyclone falls from a height of [[/r {1d12*5} #Falling Distance]]{1d12 x 5 feet}.</p>",
