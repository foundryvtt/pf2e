You can use Spirit's Sacrifice even while @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious] or otherwise unable to act. Choose one apparition you have attuned; you do not die, your @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Wounded] condition is reduced to 1 if it would be higher, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to @Damage[(2*@actor.level)[healing]]{twice your level}. The chosen apparition is dispersed until you can re-attune to it at your next daily preparations.</p>"
