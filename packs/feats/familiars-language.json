You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with creatures of the same family of animals as your familiar. For example, if your familiar were a cat, you could gain the effects of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Speak with Animals] for any felines (including leopards, lions, and tigers, among others). This ability doesn't make them more friendly than normal. If your familiar ever changes to a different creature, you can't use this ability for 1 week while you absorb your new familiar's language.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).</p>"
