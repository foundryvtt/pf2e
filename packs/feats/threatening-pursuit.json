Attempt an Intimidation check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Demoralize] all enemies within 30 feet, and you do not take a penalty for not sharing a language. If the targets are in a maze or similarly difficult-to-navigate location, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this check, and the range increases to 60 feet. Each target is temporarily immune for 1 hour.</p>"
