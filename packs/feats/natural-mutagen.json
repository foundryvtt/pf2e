Each day during your daily preparations, you can make one temporary vial of the selected mutagen. It dissipates by your next daily preparations if not consumed. If the mutagen has multiple versions (such as a greater version), your mutagen automatically becomes this higher-level version when your level equals the mutagen's level.</p>"
