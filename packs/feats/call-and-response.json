If your next action is to cast a composition cantrip with a duration of 1 round, it becomes a call. While the spell is active, one ally of your choice affected by the spell can respond to your call as a single action that has the auditory and concentrate traits to extend the spell's duration by 1 round. Only one ally can respond to a given call, and responding to the ally's response has no additional effect.</p>"
