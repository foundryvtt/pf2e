This spellcasting comes naturally and instinctively to you, rather than as a product of training. Choose a 1st-rank occult spell from either the enchantment or illusion school. You can Cast this Spell as an occult innate spell. At 6th level, you gain a 2nd-rank spell, and at 8th level, you gain a 3rd-rank spell. Each of these spells must be from either the enchantment or illusion school.</p>"
