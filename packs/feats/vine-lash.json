Make a melee @Check[deviant|defense:ac]{attack roll} against a creature within 30 feet. If you succeed, the vine deals @Damage[(floor(@actor.level/2)d6)[slashing]] damage for every 2 levels you have to the target, or double damage on a success.</p>\n<p><strong>Awakening</strong> The vine coils around your foes, squeezing them lifeless. On a successful hit, the target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Grabbed] by the vine. The DC to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] the vine is equal to your Class DC or Spell DC, whichever is higher. Each round on your turn, if the target is still grabbed, the vine squeezes them, dealing @Damage[(floor(@actor.level/2)d6)[bludgeoning]] damage for every 2 levels you have.</p>\n<p><strong>Awakening</strong> Rather than lash at your foes with a single vine, dozens of writhing vines emerge from your hands, lashing all creatures in a large area. You can use Vine Lash as a 2-action activity to damage all creatures in a @Template[cone|distance:30], with a @Check[reflex|against:class-spell|basic] save.</p>"
