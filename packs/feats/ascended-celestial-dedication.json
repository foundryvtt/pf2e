You're headstrong and determined and hardly waver in your resolve; once per hour, you can roll twice and use the higher result on a Will saving throw. If you ever become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Confused], rather than attack wildly, you become stubbornly immobile, wasting all your actions until the condition ends.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you emanate a nimbus of light. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius (and dim light to the next 30 feet). You can suppress or reestablish this light as a single action that has the concentrate trait. As long as your nimbus is active, all allies in the area of your nimbus gain a +1 status bonus to saves against fear. You gain the Bless Ally action.</p>"
