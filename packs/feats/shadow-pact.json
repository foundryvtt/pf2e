You can take [[/r 1]]{1 damage} to mix blood and shadows to cast 5th-rank <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Creation]</em> as an innate divine spell. You can use this ability as often as you wish, but you can have only one such object in existence at a time. If the object encounters bright light, the spell ends and the object dissolves into shadows.</p>"
