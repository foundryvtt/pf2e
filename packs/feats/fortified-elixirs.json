A creature that is under the effect of an infused antidote or antiplague that you created can choose to reroll a failed Fortitude saving throw against an appropriate affliction (poison for antidote and disease for antiplague). The creature doesn't gain the elixir's usual item bonus to the reroll, and after the reroll, the elixir's duration immediately ends. This is a fortune effect.</p>"
