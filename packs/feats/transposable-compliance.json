You become trained in Medicine. If you were already trained in Medicine, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can Administer First Aid without healer's tools by using your physiology instead, but you must take 1 damage to make the attempt. Similarly, you can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Treat Wounds] without healer's tools but take [[/r 2d8 #damage]]{2d8 damage}. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on all Medicine checks to Administer First Aid and Treat Wounds using your own physiology.</p>"
