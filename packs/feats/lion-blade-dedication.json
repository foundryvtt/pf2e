You become trained in your choice of Deception or Stealth and in Espionage Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You never take circumstance penalties for attempting to take a disguise of a different ancestry, age, and so on, as long as the disguised form is appropriate for your size.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.COTDddn4psjIoWry]{Lion Blade} archetype.</p>"
