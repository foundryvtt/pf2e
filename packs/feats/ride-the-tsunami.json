The waves move forward in your choice of a @Template[type:cone|distance:60] or @Template[type:line|distance:120]. If you're in water, you can increase these waves to a @Template[type:cone|distance:90] or @Template[type:line|distance:180]. Each creature in the area takes @Damage[10d10[bludgeoning]|traits:area-damage] damage with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.system.proficiencies.classDCs.kineticist.dc)|basic:true] save against your class DC. A creature that fails its save is pushed 20 feet (or 40 feet on a critical failure). Any unattended object of 1 Bulk or less in the area is pushed to the far edge of the area. The sheer mass of water extinguishes all non-magical flames in the area.</p>\n<p>As the wave crashes down, you can catch it to your destination. After the impulse deals damage, you can Swim in a straight line to any point in its area before the water disappears.</p>"
