All enemies within @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]{30 feet} of the creature you critically hit must attempt at a @Check[will|against:class] save against your class DC. Enemies that fail their saves become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 1} and are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fascinated] with you for 1 round. Your hostile actions don't end this fascination, but those of your allies do. Regardless of the effects of the save, the creature is immune to Fearful Symmetry for 1 hour.</p>"
