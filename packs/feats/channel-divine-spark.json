Your nimbus automatically activates (if it isn't already) and the area of your nimbus doubles; you shed bright light for 60 feet (and dim light to the next 60 feet). You can't suppress your nimbus while Channeling your Divine Spark. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level, and resistance to physical damage equal to half your level. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Quickened] condition and can use the extra action each round only for Strike and Stride actions. Each time that you damage a creature with a melee Strike, you can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Shove] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Trip] that creature as a free action. These effects last for 1 minute.</p>"
