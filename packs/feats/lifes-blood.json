You sacrifice some of your vitality to heal another willing living creature that's adjacent to you, coating its wounds with your blood. You lose @Damage[(max(3,floor((@actor.level -4)/2))d6)[untyped]] Hit Points, plus an additional 1d6 Hit Points for every 2 levels you have beyond 10th. This damage can't be resisted, prevented, or negated in any way. The target creature regains a number of Hit Points equal to the damage you took. Creatures you heal in this manner are then temporarily immune to your Life's Blood for 24 hours.</p>"
