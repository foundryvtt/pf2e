You open a dozen small portals to some lightless, watery abyss in a @Template[type:burst|distance:30] within 120 feet. The powerful tentacles of a kraken reach through to grab at each creature in the area. Each affected creature takes @Damage[8d6[untyped]] damage depending on its @Check[type:fortitude|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. You can Sustain the call up to 1 minute. The first time you Sustain it on each subsequent turn, each creature in the area not already @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Grabbed] by the tentacles must attempt the save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes full damage and is grabbed by a tentacle. A creature that's still grabbed by a tentacle at the end of its turn takes @Damage[3d6[bludgeoning]] damage. The tentacles' @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] DC and AC are both equal to the higher of your class DC or spell DC. A creature can attack a tentacle to attempt to free the creature trapped by it; a tentacle is destroyed if it takes 30 or more damage in a single round.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but double damage.</p>"
