Each creature in the area takes @Damage[13d6[piercing]|traits:area-damage] damage, with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.system.proficiencies.classDCs.kineticist.dc)|basic:true] save against your class DC. Each creature that fails its save is impaled, becoming @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] until it @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape]{Escapes} (the DC is your class DC); a creature that critically failed is also off-guard as long as it's impaled. The hell remains until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute. Using this impulse again ends any previous one. The first time you Sustain it each round, lightning crisscrosses the needles. Each creature in the area takes @Damage[3d12[electricity]|traits:area-damage] damage with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classDC.value)|basic:true] save against your class DC. Squares in the area are hazardous terrain. A creature takes @Damage[6[piercing]] damage for every square of the area it moves through.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Level (20th)</strong> The initial damage is 17d6, and the hazardous terrain damage is 7.</p>"
