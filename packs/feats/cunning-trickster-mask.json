You can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Feint] a target from up to 30 feet away, and if you succeed or critically succeed in your Feint attempt, the target of your Feint takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saving throws against your spells until the start of your next turn. If you don't have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Conceal Spell] feat, you gain it as a bonus feat, allowing you to disguise your spellcasting from others' eyes. If you already have the Conceal Spell feat, you can use Conceal Spell once per round as a free action instead of as a single action.</p>"
