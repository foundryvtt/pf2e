If the Strike is successful, you immediately push the target back 10 feet, then Stride or Climb and make a second ramming horn Strike against them. If the second Strike is successful, you immediately knock the target @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone], but if the second Strike is a failure or if you're unable to complete all the required actions, you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 1}. Both Strikes count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until you've made both of them.</p>"
