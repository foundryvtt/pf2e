If the trick trait has an associated skill (such as Intimidation with the fire trait) and that skill is one of your trick checks, your checks with that skill to Perform a Trick aren't penalized if you Perform a Trick using a different skill. For example, if your signature trick has Acrobatics and Intimidation as trick checks and you take this feat to add the fire trait, you can Perform a Trick using Acrobatics (at no penalty), then Acrobatics again (at a -5 penalty), and then Intimidation (at no penalty).</p>"
