You don't need to breathe, eat, or sleep, though you must still take a full night's rest every 24 hours to be able to make your daily preparations. During this time, you remain awake and alert, but you must spend the time meditating or attuning to your kinetic gate rather than engaging in other complex activities. Each kineticist attunes in their own individual way.</p>"
