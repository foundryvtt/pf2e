You can apply a poultice by @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Interact]{Interacting} with one hand.</p>\n<p>When you apply a poultice, in addition to the item's normal effects, the recipient can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of persistent acid, bleed, or fire damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.</p>"
