Psychic phenomena turn themselves on the target-typically, objects fling themselves at the creature. At the beginning of each of the target's turns, it takes [[/r 1d4[bludgeoning]]] damage for each spell level of the psi cantrip this amp was added to, with a basic Reflex save. The target remains marked by psychic ire for 3 rounds. The effect persists even if you fall @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious] or leave the area.</p>"
