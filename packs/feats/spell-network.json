While you're in this stance, an ally within your <em>spellsurge</em> aura can treat any other ally within the aura as the point of origin for a spell they cast, calculating range and cover from the other creature's space instead of their own. This allows all allied creatures within your <em>spellsurge</em> aura to act as though they're in touch range of each other since each creature is in touch range of itself. Additionally, while you're in this stance, an ally casting a spell that targets only the caster can have that spell affect any other ally within your <em>spellsurge</em> aura instead.</p>"
