Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 20 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits and precision damage. If any section is destroyed, the entire wall collapses, and each creature adjacent to the wall takes @Damage[(floor((@actor.level -6)/2)+2)d8[slashing]] damage with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.system.proficiencies.classDCs.kineticist.dc)|basic:true] save against your class DC.
