You perform both aspects of the ritual yourself, acting as both primary and a secondary caster. You must still attempt the secondary check normally performed by a secondary caster. In addition, you can use Crafting or Cooking Lore for both the primary and secondary checks. The ritual gains the primal trait as nature spirits attend to you and your guests.</p>"
