This makes the spell quieter and allows you to cast it in areas where sound can't carry. However, the spell still has visual manifestations, so this doesn't make the spell any less obvious to someone who sees you casting it.</p>\n<p>When you use Silent Spell, you can choose to gain the benefits of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Conceal Spell], and you don't need to attempt a Deception check because the spell has no verbal components.</p>"
