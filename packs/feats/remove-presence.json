If that enemy fails its save or the spell hits it, you become undetected by that creature, disappearing from its senses for 1 minute or until you use a hostile action. This is similar to being @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Invisible], but effects like <em>see invisibility</em> don't reveal you-you're affecting the target's mind, not its vision. <em>True seeing</em> can still see through this illusion if the counteract check succeeds.</p>"
