You can use Deception to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Earn Income], and you gain a +1 status bonus to your check if you do so. The illusion doesn't hold long, though! The GM rolls a secret d20; that many hours after concluding your check, the money transforms back, likely inviting consequences depending on how far the bills traveled from you in the time they were transformed.</p>"
