You take move actions to move directly toward your coffin even though you are at 0 HP, though you aren't conscious and don't have control over how you do so. While at 0 HP in this form, you are unaffected by further damage. You automatically return to your corporeal form, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious], if you reach your coffin or after 1 hour when you are destroyed, whichever one comes first.</p>"
