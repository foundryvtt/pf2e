Increase the number of items you can create each day with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Advanced Alchemy] to 6 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>In addition, when you Craft alchemical consumables during downtime, you can produce twice as many alchemical items in a single batch without spending additional preparatory time. For instance, if you are creating elixirs of life, you can craft up to eight elixirs in a single batch using downtime, rather than four. This doesn't change the amount of alchemical reagents or other ingredients required to craft each item, nor does it change your rate of progress for days past the base downtime spent.</p>"
