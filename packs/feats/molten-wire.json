On a success, the target takes @Damage[(floor((@actor.level -6)/4)+2)d6[slashing]] damage and is wrapped in molten wire for 1 minute. It is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1} and takes @Damage[(floor((@actor.level -6)/4)+2)d4[fire]] damage at the start of each of its turns, with a basic Reflex save. The wire's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] DC is your class DC. The wire has AC 10 and 75 HP.
