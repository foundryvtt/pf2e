On a failure, a creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fascinated] with you, and must spend at least one of its actions on its next turn moving toward you. On a critical failure, you acting hostile to that creature allows them to attempt another save, rather than automatically ending the fascination.</p>\n<p>These effects last until the beginning of your next turn. You can spend one action at the beginning of your turn to Sustain the effects for an additional round.
