At 7th level, the spell is heightened to 2nd rank, and every 3 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened an additional spell rank. Even though you're alive and not an object, and you can't normally recover Hit Points from effects that repair objects (like the Repair skill), you can target yourself with this innate spell and use it to recover Hit Points.</p>"
