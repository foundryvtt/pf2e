When you successfully cast a non-cantrip hex that requires 2 or more actions to cast and that doesn't require a spell attack roll, if your target is within your reach, as part of the spellcasting activity you can make a hair Strike against them before applying any effects of the hex. If this Strike misses, the hex has no effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> If your hair already has the reach trait, it instead gains the sweep trait.</p>"
