You and your hierophant both treat this weapon as a simple weapon for the purposes of proficiency. You and your hierophant gain the critical specialization effect of your favored weapon and deal an additional @Damage[1d6[spirit]] damage with Strikes made with your favored weapon. If one of your current domain spells can deal a type of damage other than spirit, you can choose to match this damage type (for instance, wreathing your weapon in sacred ashes that deal fire damage if you have the fire domain).</p>"
