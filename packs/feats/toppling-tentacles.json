Sticky black tentacles attempt to Trip each creature in the area. Attempt spell attack rolls against the Reflex DCs of each affected creature. Any creature you succeed against is knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone] and takes [[/r 3d6[bludgeoning]]] damage. Whenever a creature ends its turn in the area, the tentacles attempt to Trip that creature if it isn't already prone, and they deal [[/r 1d6[bludgeoning]]] damage to any creature already prone. Creatures treat the spell's area as difficult terrain.</p>"
