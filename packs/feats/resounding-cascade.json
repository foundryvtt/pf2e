This uses only the base damage of the stance, based on the ally's weapon specialization; it doesn't use any increase you get from bonuses, the laughing shadow hybrid study, or the like.</p>\n<p>As normal for duplicate effects, multiple Arcane Cascades affecting the same creature aren't cumulative.</p>"
