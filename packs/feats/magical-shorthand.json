If you fail, you can try again after a week or after you gain a level, whichever is first.</p>\n<p>You can use downtime to learn and inscribe new spells. This works as if you were using @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Earn Income] with the tradition's associated skill, but instead of gaining money, you choose a spell available to you to learn and gain a discount on learning it, learning it for free if your earned income equals or exceeds its cost.</p>"
