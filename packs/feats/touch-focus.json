If your next action is to Cast a Spell with 1 or more targets and a range farther than touch, you change the range to touch. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack. This only allows you to touch a single target with the spell, even if the spell originally affected more than 1 target. As long as your spell attack is successful, the target is knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone] in addition to the spell's normal effects.</p>"
