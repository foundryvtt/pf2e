Furthermore, sprites recognize you as a powerful hero (or villain) by your unique wings and are appropriately impressed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Diplomacy and Intimidation checks against sprites and gain the benefits of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Glad-Hand] skill feat against other sprites, without taking a -5 penalty to your Diplomacy check.</p>"
