Your eyes begin to glow and change color while your limbs and neck grow a veneer of scales, all the same color as the associated dragon, accompanied by a near-insatiable desire to amass a hoard of your own. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Dragon Breath] sorcerer bloodline spell, emulating the breath of the associated dragon, and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. If you already have a focus pool, increase your number of Focus Points by 1. You Refocus by counting and arranging your treasure.</p>"
