If you spend an additional Mythic Point while casting it, you reduce its casting time to 1 hour, and both the primary and secondary casters attempt their corresponding skill checks at mythic proficiency. If you would critically fail the ritual, you fail instead. Additionally, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Unimpeded Stride] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Word of Freedom] domain spells. These are focus spells, granting you a focus pool of 2 Focus Points or expanding that pool if you already have one. You can Refocus while you meditate on the concepts of freedom and liberty.</p>"
