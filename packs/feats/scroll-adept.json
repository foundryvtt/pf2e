As normal for a scroll, these are consumable items of light Bulk, and someone holding the item in one hand can Cast the Spell from it if it's on their spell list, using their spell attack modifier and spell DC.</p>\n<p>If you have master proficiency in spell DC, you can create three temporary scrolls during your daily preparations, and if you have legendary proficiency, you can create four temporary scrolls.</p>"
