Attempt a @Check[type:medicine|dc:40|showDC:all] check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Raise Dead]</em>, except it still has the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Wounded] condition it had before @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dying], increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day.</p>"
