This has no effect on a 19 if the result would be a failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Transcendenceâ€”Plant Thirty Barbs</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (death, transcendence) You snap off a fragment of your ikon within your opponent's body, which threatens to burst into numerous barbs. Make a Strike with your ikon. If successful, barbs fill the target, dealing two die of weapon damage the first time the creature uses a move action on each of its turns; the barbs are made out of the same material as your weapon ikon and bypass resistances and such accordingly (for instance, a cold iron spear would create cold iron barbs). The barbs last for [[/gmr 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}. If the target dies while the barbs are still in their body, the barbs burst forth in a forest of thorns covering the creature's space, which are greater difficult terrain and deal piercing damage equal to half your level for each square that is moved into.</p>"
