This Grapple uses your impulse attack roll instead of an Athletics check and shares your multiple attack penalty. The sand snatcher lasts until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain the impulse up to 1 minute. Each time you Sustain the impulse, you can have the sand snatcher either Grapple again or Burrow, Climb, or Stride up to 20 feet.
