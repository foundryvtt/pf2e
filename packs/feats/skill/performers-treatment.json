In addition, you can realize at the last moment when you should just be pretending to avoid doing any lasting harm.</p>\n<p>When you critically fail a Medicine check to Administer First Aid, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Treat Disease], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Treat Poison], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Treat Wounds], you can attempt a @Check[performance|against:perception] check against the patient's Perception DC.
