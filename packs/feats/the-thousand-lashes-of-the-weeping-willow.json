The trunk of the weeping willow tree is 10-feet in diameter and appears in an unoccupied space within 500 feet. The tree whips its branches at all your enemies within a @Template[emanation|distance:30]{30-foot-radius emanation } centered on the willow's trunk, dealing @Damage[(10 + floor(@actor.level/20)*4)d8[slashing]] damage with a @Check[reflex|against:kineticist|basic] save against your class DC. A creature that fails its save is also overcome with sorrow, becoming @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 1} for as long as the willow remains, as it weeps uncontrollably. The willow doesn't target you or your allies.</p>\n<p>The willow tree remains until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute. The first time you Sustain the impulse each round, the weeping willow attacks again, dealing @Damage[floor(@actor.level/4)d8[slashing]] damage to all enemies in the area with a basic reflex save. If you use this impulse again, the previous one ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Level (20th)</strong> The initial damage is 14d8, and the Sustained damage is 5d8.</p>"
