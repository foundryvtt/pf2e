You concentrate and unleash a @Template[cone|distance:15] that deals @Damage[(ceil(@actor.level/2)d6)[mental]|options:area-damage] damage to all creatures in the area, with a @Check[will|against:class-spell|basic|options:area-effect] save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. After the attack, your mind weapon automatically re-forms, and you can't use this ability again for 1 minute. Mind Shards' damage increases by 1d6 at level 7 and every two levels thereafter.</p>"
