You fire a blast or beam from one hand. Make an @Check[type:deviant|defense:ac]{attack roll} against a creature within 30 feet. If you succeed, the beam deals @Damage[(floor(@actor.level/2)d6)[@actor.flags.pf2e.deviantAbilities.dragon.damageType]]{1d6 damage} for every 2 levels you have to the target, or double damage on a critical success.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Awakening</strong> Your beams blast through targets. Instead of making an attack roll to damage a single creature within 30 feet, you can use Blasting Beams as a 2-action activity to damage all creatures in a @Template[type:line|distance:60], with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)|basic:true] save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Awakening</strong> You can choose to launch smaller, quicker beams from your eyes instead. These deal [[/r (floor(@actor.level/2)d4)]]{d4s} instead of d6s, but the attack has the agile trait, and you don't need a hand free to make it, though your eyes must be uncovered.</p>"
