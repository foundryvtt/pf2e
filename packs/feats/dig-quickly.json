The cloud extinguishes small, unattended, non-magical fires and helps smother the flames on burning creatures located within the cone; creatures in this cone that are taking @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Persistent Damage]{Persistent Fire Damage} can immediately attempt an additional flat DC 15 check to end the persistent damage.</p>"
