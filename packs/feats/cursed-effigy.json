You incorporate the material into a premade doll, paper figure, or other effigy to create a sympathetic link that makes it harder to resist your abilities. As long as you are Exploiting Vulnerability against that creature, it takes a -2 status penalty to its saving throws against thaumaturge abilities or items that use your thaumaturge class DC.</p>"
