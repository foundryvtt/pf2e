If the triggering Strike was a misfire, you get a normal failure instead. If the triggering Strike was a failure, it becomes a glancing blow that deals minimum damage for the Strike (adding any bonuses as normal but getting a result of 1 for all damage dice that would be rolled on a success). The glancing blow does not apply other effects that would normally happen only on a hit.</p>"
