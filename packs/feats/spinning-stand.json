You enter talon stance if you weren't in it already, make a spinning talon Strike against an enemy in reach, and then Stand. You don't take the -2 circumstance penalty for attacking while prone, and your Stand action doesn't trigger reactions. You can spend two actions using Spinning Stand to make two spinning talon Strikes instead of one; these Strikes must be against separate targets.</p>"
