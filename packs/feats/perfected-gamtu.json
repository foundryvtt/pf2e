Doing so removes the effects of <em>invisibility</em> from the original wearer, but the spell doesn't end. Instead, the effect continues to elapse; if another creature puts the gamtu on, they're immediately affected by <em>invisibility</em>, which lasts for the remaining duration of Hat Trick.</p>"
