For obvious reasons, merfolk prefer to discourage these rumors (with violence, if necessary), but you're living proof that there's at least a fraction of truth to such claims.

When you do so, you don't need healer's tools, and you gain a +1 item bonus to your Medicine check.</p>\n<p>If someone were to eat your heart and liver within an hour of your death, they would be healed of all physical injuries (regaining Hit Points up to their maximum) and would cease to age for 8 years.</p>"
