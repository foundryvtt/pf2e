At the beginning of your target's next turn, it takes damage equal to twice the triggering spell's rank as a seemingly random and minor misfortune finds it. The damage and type of misfortune is of a type matching the spell; for instance, if you dealt fire damage, a flame might spontaneous ignite on them or they might burn a hand on their torch. The target is then temporarily immune to Foretell Harm for 24 hours.</p>"
