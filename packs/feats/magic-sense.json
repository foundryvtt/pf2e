This detects magic in your field of vision only. When you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek], you gain the benefits of a 3rd-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Detect Magic] spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast (arcane, divine, primal, or occult).</p>"
