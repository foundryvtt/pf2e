During your daily preparations, you can reconfigure part of your storied skin to depict a specific orc hero, granting you a 1st-level ancestry feat with the orc trait until you prepare again; this ancestry feat cannot require any physiological feature you lack, as determined by the GM. Since this feat is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for permanent character options, such as for a feat. At 13th level, you can instead gain a 5th-level ancestry feat with the orc trait.</p>"
