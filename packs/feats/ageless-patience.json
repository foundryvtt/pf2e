            "value": "<p>You work at a pace born from longevity that enhances your thoroughness. You can voluntarily spend twice as much time as normal on a Perception check or skill check that takes 1 action or longer. If you do, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check and don't automatically reduce your degree of success on a natural 1 (you get a critical failure only if your result is 10 lower than the DC). For example, you could get these benefits if you spent 2 actions to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek], which normally takes 1 action. You can get these benefits during exploration by taking twice as long exploring as normal, or in downtime by spending twice as much downtime.</p>\n<p>The GM might determine a situation doesn't grant you a benefit if a delay would be directly counterproductive to your success, such as a tense negotiation with an impatient creature.</p>"
