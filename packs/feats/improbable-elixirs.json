Select a number of potions equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1); these potions must be of 9th level or lower. You gain formulas to create these potions as alchemical consumables with the elixir trait. When making these alchemical elixirs, you can substitute alchemical reagents for an equal value of magical components, and you can use an alchemist's toolkit (for @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Quick Alchemy]) or an alchemist's lab (for the Craft activity) instead of any other required toolkits. Other than that, the formula doesn't change. Once you've chosen the potion formulas, they can't be changed.</p>"
