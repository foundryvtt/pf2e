Spend a Mythic Point and make a Strike at mythic proficiency against the required creature. If you succeed and deal damage, the target must succeed on a @Check[fortitude|against:class-spell] save against your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher) or die. If the target succeeds, they are immune to this ability for 24 hours.</p>"
