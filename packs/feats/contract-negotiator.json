When negotiating deals or agreements, you can use Legal Lore in place of Diplomacy to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Make an Impression] or a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Request], even if there is no legal framework under which you are negotiating. If you are an expert in Diplomacy, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to these checks; if you are a master in Diplomacy, this increases to +2, and +3 if you are legendary.</p>"
