Even when your ikon is not empowered, you can shrink it to a miniature size (with negligible Bulk) and keep it tucked behind an ear, in your hair, or in a similar discreet location. You can shrink your weapon or regrow it to its normal size as part of drawing it, putting it away, swapping it, or picking it up.</p>\n<p><strong>Immanence</strong> Your ikon gains the reach trait. If it already had the reach trait, it instead increases your reach by an additional 10 feet, instead of the usual additional 5 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Transcendenceâ€”Topple the Pillar of Heaven</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (transcendence) Your ikon extends to an impossible length, striking all in its way. You deal @Damage[6d8[untyped]] damage to all creatures in a @Template[type:line|distance:60], with a @Check[reflex|against:class|basic] save against your class DC. The damage type matches that of your weapon. At 14th level and every two levels thereafter, the damage increases by [[/r 1d8]].</p>"
