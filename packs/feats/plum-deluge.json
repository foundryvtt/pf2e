As part of this ability, you Interact to draw three vials of the same contact poison and throw them in the air, where they shatter and spread a poisonous deluge affecting a @Template[type:burst|distance:20] within 60 feet. All creatures in the burst are automatically exposed to the poison, immediately bypassing any onset time, and must attempt a saving throw against that poison. The three vials must be identical, even if the poison can come in multiple types or different levels.</p>"
