Make a melee Strike against each enemy within your melee reach. Your last attack must be against the grabbed creature, and you gain a circumstance bonus to your attack roll equal to the number of enemies you slammed them into, to a maximum of +3. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks. After your Whirling Clobber, you release the grabbed or restrained creature into an open square within reach of your lash.</p>"
