Otherwise, you automatically keep rolling at this Speed during subsequent turns until you hit the bottom of the incline or an obstacle ends this movement (which can happen in the middle of your turn). You're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 2} each turn after the first that you keep rolling, and if you hit an obstacle on a turn after the first, you and the obstacle both take [[/r 4d6[bludgeoning]]] damage and you stop rolling.</p>"
