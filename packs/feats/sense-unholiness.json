This functions as a vague sense, similar to humans' sense of smell. An unholy creature using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence attempts a @Check[deception|against:perception|rollerRole:target|showDC:all] check against your Perception DC to hide its sanctification from you. If the creature succeeds at its Deception check, it is then temporarily immune to your Sense Unholiness for 1 day.</p>"
