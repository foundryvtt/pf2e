The cushion ends when the target reaches the ground, and the creature takes no damage from the fall. The cushion expires if the creature doesn't reach the ground within 1 minute, but any distance it fell during that minute doesn't count for any damage the creature would take from the fall. You can't use Air Cushion again while you have one in effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Level (8th)</strong> The range is 120 feet, and you can create cushions for up to 5 falling creatures with one reaction.</p>"
