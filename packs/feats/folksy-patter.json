Using slang, jokes, halfling loanwords, and the like, you convey a simple message consisting of three basic words (such as \"Danger assassin flee\" or \"Meet me moonrise\"). Your intended listener can attempt a @Check[type:perception|dc:20] check to discern the message. This DC is reduced by 5 if the listener is a halfling or has Folksy Patter, or by 10 if both apply (@Check[type:perception|dc:15] @Check[type:perception|dc:10]). Eavesdroppers can also attempt a @Check[type:perception|dc:resolve(@actor.perception.dc)] check against your Deception DC to discern your meaning. Any bonuses or penalties to Perception checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sense Motive] apply to checks to understand Folksy Patter.</p>"
