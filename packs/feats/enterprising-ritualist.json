If a ritual has a Cost entry that has a value in gp, reduce the amount you need to spend by 10%. If you critically succeed at the primary check for a ritual, the gp value of components the ritual consumes is reduced by the same amount. For example, using resurrect to bring back a 14th-level creature normally costs 1,050 gp, but would cost you only 945 gp; and if you critically succeeded at the primary Religion check, you would spend only 840 gp.</p>"
