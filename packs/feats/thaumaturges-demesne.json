Additionally, the demesne is attended by three unseen custodians, as a successful <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Unseen Custodians]</em> ritual, and one object in the area gains an elemental sentinel, as a successful <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Elemental Sentinel]</em> ritual.</p>"
