If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one. Attempt a counteract check against the condition using your Medicine modifier as your counteract modifier and the condition's source to determine the DC. You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you have Legendary Medic; even if you do, the counteract DC increases by 10. Treating a Condition that is continually applied under certain circumstances (for instance, the enfeebled condition a holy character gains from carrying a weapon with the unholy rune) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Reduce the condition value by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Reduce the condition value by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Increase the condition value by 1.</p>"
