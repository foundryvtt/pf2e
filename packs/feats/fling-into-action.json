When you attempt a Reflex save, you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the save at mythic proficiency. If the check is successful, you immediately fling yourself up to 30 feet in a direction of your choice, or up to 60 feet on a critical success. When flinging yourself in this manner, you can move the entire distance in a straight horizontal or vertical line, or you can move 5 feet horizontally for every 10 feet you move vertically. For example, if you got a critical success using Fling Into Action while Grabbing an Edge as you fall from the middle of a cliff, you could hurl yourself 40 feet up the cliffside and 20 feet forward onto a plateau at the top of the cliff.</p>"
