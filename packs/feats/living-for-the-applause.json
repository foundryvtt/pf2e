The attention reinvigorates you and keeps you from being knocked out. You remain at 1 Hit Point, and your @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Wounded] condition increases by 1.</p>\n<p>In addition, attempt a @Check[type:performance|dc:@self.dc] check; the DC is determined by the GM but is typically the standard DC for your level or the DC to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Make an Impression] on the spectators, whichever is higher. On a success, the crowd erupts in applause and cheers at your comeback, much to the dismay of your enemies. Concern for the crowd's reaction should your opponent deliver a finishing blow gives you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your next turn. On a critical success, you don't expend your daily use of Living for the Applause and can use the reaction an additional time on the same day.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Item.Effect: Living for the Applause]</p>"
