The vision appears in a @Template[type:burst|distance:20] within 100 feet. The illusion lasts until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute. Using this impulse again ends any previous one. Each creature in the area or that later enters it must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.system.proficiencies.classDCs.kineticist.dc)] save against your class DC. Creatures with the air trait are immune. Any effect of the illusion ends for a creature as soon as it leaves the illusion's area or the impulse ends, and the creature then becomes temporarily immune for 1 hour.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard].</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is off-guard. It is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fleeing] from the illusory sky but is also disoriented; any time it uses an action to attempt to flee, it must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:11] or flee to a space that's still within the illusion. The GM determines where the creatures ends up, but the creature can't stay stationary if it's able to move.</p>"
