When you gain this feat, you can retrain existing spells to replace them with ones on this list.</p>\n<p>In addition, your knowledge of the conduits to the Forge of Creation allows you more flexibility with these spells. Choose one of these two benefits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you're a prepared spellcaster, you can spend 10 minutes to replace one of the spells you've prepared with a spell of the same rank from the list of sacred spells. You can do this while Refocusing.</li>\n<li>If you're a spontaneous spellcaster with the signature spells class feature, add two of the spells from the list of sacred spells to your repertoire. They are signature spells for you, in addition to your normal signature spells. When you gain the ability to cast a new rank of spells, you can choose to switch the spells from this feat to any other spells from the list.</li>\n</ul>"
