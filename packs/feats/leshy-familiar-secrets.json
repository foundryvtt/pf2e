You can select one additional familiar ability each day, which must be one of the following leshy familiar abilities. You can't select more than one ability from this feat at a time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.familiar-abilities.Item.Grasping Tendrils]</strong> Your familiar can extend vines or similar tendrils, increasing its reach to 15 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.familiar-abilities.Item.Purify Air]</strong> Your familiar recycles air, providing enough oxygen for a Medium creature in areas with stale air, such as a sealed chamber or extradimensional space. Creatures within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:15] of the leshy gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their saving throws against inhaled poison effects, olfactory effects, or other effects that rely on breathing (such as toxic cloud), at the GM's discretion.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.familiar-abilities.Item.Verdant Burst]</strong> When your familiar dies, it releases its primal energy to cast the 3-action version of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Heal], heightened to a rank 1 lower than your highest-rank spell slot. The heal spell gains a status bonus equal to twice the spell's rank to the Hit Points it restores to plants. You must be able to cast 2nd-rank spells using spell slots to select this familiar ability.</li>\n</ul>"
