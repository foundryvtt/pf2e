If the leshy is within the area of an inhaled poison effect or an effect that relies on smell, creatures within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:15] from the leshy gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their saving throws against the effect.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.familiar-abilities.Item.Verdant Burst]</strong> When your familiar dies,it releases its primal energy to cast the 3-action version of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Heal]</em>, heightened to a level 1 lower than your highest-level spell slot.
