You swear a vow to defeat one creature within 60 feet that has the holy or unholy trait. The first time each round that you deal damage to that creature, you deal an additional @Damage[1d6[spirit]] damage. You can't use Vow of Mortal Defiance again until you or the target is defeated, flees, or the encounter ends.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> If you take this feat, you can't become sanctified with the holy or unholy trait. Retraining out of this feat typically requires a major change of philosophy.</p>"
