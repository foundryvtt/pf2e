With a heavy impact of your armored heel, you crack the ground underneath you. The ground within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] becomes difficult terrain. If you are a master or better in the armor you are wearing, this becomes greater difficult terrain. The cracked ground settles and reverts to normal terrain after 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> At 16th level, you can take this feat again.
