Attempt a counteract check against the triggering effect; your counteract rank equals half your level (rounded up), and for the roll use either your class DC – 10 or your spellcasting attribute modifier plus your spellcasting proficiency bonus. If you counteract the triggering effect, you end the effect for all other creatures in the area; however, you must still save against the effect with a –2 penalty to the initial save.</p>"
