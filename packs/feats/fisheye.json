If you eat the left eye of a fish, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Breath Control] feat for the next hour, and that feat's benefits apply against effects that have the olfactory trait in addition to those that have the inhaled trait. As this feat is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for a permanent character option like a feat or access to a spell.</p>"
