You can cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Silence] on yourself as a 2nd-rank innate occult spell and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ventriloquism] as a 1st-rank innate occult spell, both once per day. You also can cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ghost Sound] as an innate occult cantrip. You become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your key spellcasting ability is Charisma.</p>"
