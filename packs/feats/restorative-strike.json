Cast a 1-action <em>harm</em> or <em>heal</em> spell to heal yourself, expending the spell normally. It loses the manipulate trait when cast this way. Then make a melee Strike. If you make this Strike with your deity's favored weapon, you gain a +1 status bonus to the attack roll.</p>\n<p>If the Strike hits, you can target a second willing creature to heal the same amount from the spell. This creature can be outside of the spell's range, provided it's adjacent to the enemy you hit.</p>"
