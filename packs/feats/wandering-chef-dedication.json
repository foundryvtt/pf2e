When using the Subsist downtime activity, you can use Crafting or Cooking Lore in place of Survival, and if you roll a failure, you get a success instead.</p>\n<p>You gain the Quick Alchemy benefits, but can use it only to create consumables, and the consumables must be alchemical food. Any items you choose with Alchemical Crafting must be alchemical food, but they can be 1st level or 2nd level instead of only 1st level.</p>\n<p>You create up to 4 versatile vials during your daily preparations.
