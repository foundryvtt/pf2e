When throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, instead of splashing all squares adjacent to the target, you can create a splash in a @Template[cone|distance:15]. You choose the cone's direction, but its first square must be a square in the target's space.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> If you have the Expanded Splash feat or another ability that increases the radius of splash damage, you can have the splash damage be a @Template[cone|distance:20].</p>"
