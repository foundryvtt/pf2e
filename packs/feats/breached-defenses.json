If you prefer, you can choose the following benefit instead of one of the usual two benefits from Exploit Vulnerability.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Breached Defenses</strong> You can choose this benefit only if you succeeded at Exploit Vulnerability and learned the creature has at least one resistance that can be bypassed.
