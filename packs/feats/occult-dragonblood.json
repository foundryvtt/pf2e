If you would automatically become trained in Occultism (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Oddity Identification] skill feat. If you choose a draconic exemplar, you must choose an occult dragon.</p>"
