You command your mount to Stride up to double its Speed (or to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Burrow], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Climb], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Fly], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Swim], if it has the corresponding movement type), moving through the spaces of any foes in your path up to one size smaller than your mount. Your mount deals the damage of one of its melee Strikes to each creature whose space you move through, with a basic Reflex save against your mount's Athletics DC. On a critical failure, the creature also becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] until the end of your next turn. Roll the damage only once. You can damage a given creature only once during this movement.</p>"
