            "value": "<p>A whirling grindstone made of flint appears in an unoccupied square within 30 feet. The grindstone shreds flesh and shoots sparks. Attempt an @Check[type:impulse|defense:ac]{impulse attack} roll against the AC of a creature adjacent to the grindstone. On a hit, the creature takes @Damage[(floor((@actor.level -4)/5)+2)d6[slashing], (floor((@actor.level -4)/5)+1)d6[fire]] damage (or double damage on a critical hit). The grindstone lasts until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain the impulse up to 1 minute. On subsequent turns, the first time you Sustain the impulse that turn, you can roll the grindstone up to 20 feet and can repeat the attack.</p>\n<p>A creature within reach of the grindstone can Interact with it to sharpen a metal weapon. This grants a +2 circumstance bonus to the next damage roll made with that weapon within 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Level (+5)</strong> The grindstone's damage increases by 1d6 slashing and 1d6 fire, and the bonus to weapons increases by 1.</p>"
