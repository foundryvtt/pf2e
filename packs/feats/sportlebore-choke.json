The sportlebores attempt to force their way into the mouth of each creature in your swarm's space. Each creature takes @Damage[(floor(@actor.level/2))d4[piercing]] damage depending on its @Check[fortitude|against:class-spell] save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. The damage increases by 1d4 at 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter. Regardless of the result of its save, the creature is temporarily immune to sportlebore choke for 1 hour.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature if unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half damage and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1} as it spits out most of the offending sportlebores.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The sportlebores crawl down the creature's throat. The creature takes full damage and is sickened 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature takes double damage and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 2}.</p>"
