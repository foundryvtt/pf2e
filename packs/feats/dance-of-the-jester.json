You perform any two of the following actions: Drop Prone, Release an object, Stand, Step, or Stride. You must perform two different actions. Your opponent also takes these actions, moving in the same direction as you (for instance, if you Stride north, so does your opponent) or Releasing an object when you do. The target is then temporarily immune to your Dance of the Jester for 1 day.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, except you can take only one action, not two, before your target becomes temporarily immune to your dance, and you cannot move the target into hazardous terrain.</p>"
