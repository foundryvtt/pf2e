            "value": "<p>Your ability to captivate others borders on the preternatural. You are seldom at a loss in social situations, and you can create minor enchantments or illusions. Choose Deception or Diplomacy. You become trained in that skill, or become an expert if you were already trained.</p>\n<p>Choose two cantrips from the occult list; each cantrip must be from either the enchantment or illusion school. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity and can cast these spells as occult innate spells. You're trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs. If you have a hand free, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.b7oePIMEMdFFS5TH]{Captivator} archetype.</p>"
