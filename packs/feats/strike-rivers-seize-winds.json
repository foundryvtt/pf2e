You can create each of the following spell effects at the listed rank, but you can't create effects more than once per hour and you can't perform a given effect more than once per day: 4th hydraulic torrent, 5th control water, 6th howling blizzard, 7th volcanic eruption, 8th punishing winds.</p>\n<p>Creating the effects requires the same type and number of actions as Casting the Spell, and they use the higher of your class DC or spell DC when appropriate. Because you are creating these effects with your godly might rather than Casting a Spell, they can't be dispelled or counteracted.</p>"
