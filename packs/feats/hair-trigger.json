If this Strike hits, the target is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] until the end of your first turn of the encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> If your initial deed allows you to Interact to draw a weapon more than once, this feat allows you to replace one of these Interact actions and use the other one to draw a weapon. You can't replace both Interact actions with Strikes, but you can draw a loaded firearm or crossbow with one of the actions and immediately shoot it with the other.</p>"
