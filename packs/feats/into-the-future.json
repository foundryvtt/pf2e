If your next action is to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Cast a Spell] that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast, the spell's effects occur 1 round later, at the beginning of your next turn, rather than immediately. Targets and choices about the spell must be determined when the spell is cast, and requirements, such as line of sight and line of effect, must be valid both when the spell is cast and when its effects occur. Consequences for the action of Casting the Spell itself, such as a Reactive Strike reaction or ending a foe's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fascinated] condition by taking a hostile action, aren't delayed.</p>"
