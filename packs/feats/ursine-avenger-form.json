In your ursine form, you gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals @Damage[1d8[piercing]] and a claws unarmed attack that deals @Damage[1d6[slashing]] and has the agile trait. Both unarmed attacks are in the brawling group. You lose the ability to speak complex sentences while transformed and can only communicate through grunts and gestures; this prevents you from using effects that require a shared or spoken language until you revert back to your non-hybrid form. You can use this action while transformed to remove the hood and return to your original form.</p>"
