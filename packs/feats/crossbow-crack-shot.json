When you're wielding a crossbow and Interact to reload it, including Interact actions as part of your slinger's reload and similar effects, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the damage roll on your next Strike with that crossbow. As normal, this isn't cumulative with the +1 circumstance bonus from singular expertise. If the crossbow is a simple crossbow, also increase the damage die size for that attack by one step. You must make the attack before the end of your turn or these benefits are lost.</p>"
