Once per day, you can speak to an object and ask it a question to gain the effects of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Object Reading], though the object gives you its response 1 minute later (as it takes the spirit within the object some time to rouse). An object's ability to answer is limited by its particular nature; a pair of shoes might know where their owner has walked, while a house knows the history of the denizens within, but not what they do elsewhere.</p>"
