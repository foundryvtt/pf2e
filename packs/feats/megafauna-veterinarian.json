You can attempt a Nature check instead of a Medicine check for any of Medicine's trained and untrained uses, provided the subject of your medical care is a megafauna. If you're attempting an action that requires a particular proficiency rank in Medicine (such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Treat Wounds]), use your proficiency rank in Nature instead. If the subject of your care is your megafauna and you roll a success on your check, you get a critical success instead.</p>"
