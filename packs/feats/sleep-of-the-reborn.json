You take it to another level by reliving previous lives in dreams, always waking invigorated and thankful for a new chance at life. Whenever you rest for 8 hours, you gain the effects of a long-term rest. If you're an ancestry that neither sleeps nor dreams, you still receive this benefit by entering a reflective, meditative state during rest.</p>"
