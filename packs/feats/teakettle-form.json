When you Change Shape, you can assume the form of a simple tool or object of 1 Bulk or less, such as a teakettle or umbrella. When transformed into an object, you can function as that object for allies to use; for instance, turning into a crowbar so you can help an ally pry open a crate. You can speak while in object form, but you can't attack, cast spells, or move except to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Crawl] (usually by hopping or flopping across the ground in an undignified manner).</p>"
