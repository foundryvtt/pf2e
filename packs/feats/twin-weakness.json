Make a melee Strike against the target of your Exploit Vulnerability. On any attack roll result but a critical failure, you also press your implement against the creature, automatically dealing the additional damage from Exploit Vulnerability. This is in addition to any damage from your Strike, including the weakness the Strike applies from Exploit Vulnerability. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty.</p>"
