A @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Razmiri Mask (Silver)]{Silver Razmiri Mask} grants a +2 item bonus to Deception checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Lie] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Feint], is a 10th-level item, and gains the following activation in addition to that possessed by the standard mask.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activateâ€”Call Upon Razmir's Mercy</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate, manipulate, occult)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> three times per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Exhorting Razmir to purge impurities from your target, you lay hands on a creature within reach and cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Cleanse Affliction] as an occult spell with a spell rank equal to half your level. Unlike a normal <em>cleanse affliction</em> spell, this doesn't reduce the stage of the affliction; instead, if the counteract check is successful, the affliction's stage is temporarily reduced by 1 and its effects are suppressed for 24 hours, after which the affliction resumes in full force. If the target would have been required to attempt additional saves against the affliction during the 24 hours it was suppressed, they must attempt all of those saving throws as soon as the 24-hour duration ends. This could mean that the target saves successfully and it is as if the affliction were truly healed, or it could mean that the affliction returns and advances multiple stages all at once.</p>"
