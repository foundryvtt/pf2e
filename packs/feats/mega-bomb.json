This isn't a Strike, and you don't make an attack roll. The mega bomb explodes in a @Template[type:burst|distance:30] within 60 feet. It deals damage as if each creature were the primary target, with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.system.proficiencies.classDCs.alchemist.value)|basic:true] save. On a failed save, a creature also takes any extra effects that affect a primary target (such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] from bottled lightning). Though all targets in the area take splash damage as primary targets, there is no further splash beyond that area.</p>"
