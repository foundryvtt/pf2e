You gain @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Interplanar Teleport] as a primal innate spell. You can cast it twice per week. This can be used only to travel back and forth between the Plane of Earth and the Material Plane. Due to your attunement to the Onyx Key, you can act as the spell focus, and you do not require a tuning fork.</p>"
