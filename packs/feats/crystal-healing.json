Doing so requires you to use at least two semiprecious stones with a total value of 5 gp or more in place of healer's tools, which allows you to attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Treat Disease] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Treat Poison] using Occultism rather than Medicine.</p>\n<p>If you're an expert in Occultism and you use gems whose total value equals or exceeds 50 gp, you gain a +1 item bonus to your Occultism check. If you're a master and the gems' value equals or exceeds 700 gp, the item bonus increases to +2; if you're legendary in Occultism and the gems' value equals or exceeds 15,000 gp, the item bonus increases to +3.</p>"
