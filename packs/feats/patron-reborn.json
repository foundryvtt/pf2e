You gain darkvision, constant @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Truesight], and the ability to see into all other transitive planes that overlap the one you are in.</p>\n<p>You can be a patron for other witches. Choose a single type of patron you represent, such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.The Resentment] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Starless Shadow]. An allied witch you can observe who has that patron counts as and gains the benefits of your @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Witch's Charge] feat, even if you did not select them as your charge during your daily preparations.</p>\n<p>You learn the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wish] ritual and can impart that knowledge to your charges. Once per month, when one of your charges performs the <em>wish</em> ritual, you can roll the skill check in their place.</p>"
