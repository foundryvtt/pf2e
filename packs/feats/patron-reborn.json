Choose a single type of patron you represent, such as The Resentment or Starless Shadow. An allied witch you can observe who has that patron counts as and gains the benefits of your Witch's Charge feat, even if you did not select them as your charge during your daily preparations.</p>\n<p>You learn the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wish] ritual and can impart that knowledge to your charges. Once per month, when one of your charges performs the <em>wish</em> ritual, you can roll the skill check in their place.</p>"
