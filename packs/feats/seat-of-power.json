You determine the appearance of this seat of power, such as a duskwood longhouse, a crumbling stone castle, an ice tower, or a pagoda constructed from the solidified souls of the damned. You can enter your realm using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Enter Seat Of Power] activity. You and any creatures you choose gain three times as many Hit Points when resting within your seat of power. Once per day while within your seat of power, you can cast cleanse affliction as a 4th-rank innate divine spell or sound body as a 4th-rank innate divine spell. You can target only yourself with these spells.</p>"
