Both you and the triggering creature have @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.other-effects.Item.Effect: Cover]{Standard Cover} as long as you remain adjacent to each other and you both have your shields raised; when this is no longer the case, the effect ends. You and your ally can't use this cover to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Hide], as it's obvious you're standing there holding your shields, but you and your ally can use it to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Take Cover]. Normally, if you and your ally don't move, Shield Wall lasts until the beginning of your next turn, when your shield is no longer raised.</p>"
