You must still rest at least 8 hours and spend 1 hour of preparation to regain resources usable only a limited number of times per day, such as spell slots. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases, poisons, and effects that would cause the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Paralyzed] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned] conditions. When you roll a successful saving throw against a disease or poison, you get a critical success instead.</p>"
