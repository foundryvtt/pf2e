You gain an edict to defend against creatures of that kind.</p>\n<p>Allies in your champion's aura, not including you, get resistance 2 to damage dealt by creatures with the chosen trait. If such a creature deals more than one damage type at once, apply this resistance only to the highest amount of damage. The resistance increases to 3 at 7th level, 4 at 12th level, and 5 at 17th level. If a creature with the chosen trait triggers your champion's reaction and your champion's reaction grants resistance against the triggering damage, the resistance increases by 5.</p>"
