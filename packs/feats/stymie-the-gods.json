Either you or your hierophant are able to use this action. When either of you do, you both gain a +2 status bonus to Armor Class and saving throws against divine spells, as well as the spells, Strikes, and abilities of extraplanar creatures, for 3 rounds. This benefit affects both you and your hierophant even if you are on separate planes of existence when this ability is used.</p>\n<p>If a Mythic Point is spent by the individual using Stymie the Gods, the bonus increases to +4 and the effects last for 10 minutes</p>"
