You ignore any mental effects without the fear trait that would rob you of your agency (for example, on a failed save against charm you would still be able to take hostile actions, and against laughing fit you would still be able to take reactions but would remain slowed, but on a critical failure against fear you would still be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fleeing] because it's a fear effect). Additionally, you are immune to effects that would imprison your soul (such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Seize Soul], or a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Final Blade]).</p>"
