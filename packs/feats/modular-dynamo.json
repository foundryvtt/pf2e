Your dynamo attack gains the modular trait, as well as one of the following configurations of your choice: power driver (@Damage[1d6[bludgeoning]] damage; shove), percussive striker (@Damage[1d4[bludgeoning]] damage; agile, finesse), rotating sickle (@Damage[1d6[slashing]] damage; trip), or entangling barbs (@Damage[1d6[piercing]] damage; grapple). If you have a manually controlled dynamo, these damage dice increase by 1 size, as usual, and you can also choose the extendable baton (@Damage[1d4[bludgeoning]] damage; finesse, reach), which has the damage increase already factored in.</p>\n<p>When you use an Interact action to switch configurations using the modular trait, you switch between the initial configuration of dynamo you chose with the Sterling Dynamo Dedication and the new configuration you chose with Modular Dynamo.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, you choose another configuration and add it to the list of options you can choose when you use an Interact action with the modular trait.</p>"
