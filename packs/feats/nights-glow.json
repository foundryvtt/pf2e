Like your Oatia skysage spells, you cast this focus spell as an occult spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover by using the Refocus to reflect upon or gaze at the stars.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can take this feat a second time, gaining the focus spell that you didn't gain the first time. Increase the number of Focus Points in your pool by 1.</p>"
