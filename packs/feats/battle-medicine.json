Attempt a Medicine check with the same DC as for @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Treat Wounds] and restore the corresponding amount of HP; this doesn't remove the wounded condition. As with Treat Wounds, you can attempt checks against higher DCs if you have the minimum proficiency rank. The target is then @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Item.Effect: Battle Medicine Immunity]{immune} to your Battle Medicine for 1 day. This does not make them immune to, or otherwise count as, Treat Wounds.</p>"
