Attempt a Medicine check with the same DC as for @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Treat Wounds] and restore the corresponding amount of HP; this doesn't remove the wounded condition. As with Treat Wounds, you can attempt checks against higher DCs if you have the minimum proficiency rank. The target is then immune to your Battle Medicine for 1 day. This does not make them immune to, or otherwise count as, Treat Wounds.</p>"
