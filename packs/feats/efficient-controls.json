Reduce the number of crew required to operate your signature vehicle by 25%. For example, you would reduce a sailing ship from needing 1 pilot and 8 crew to 1 pilot and 6 crew. This adjustment only affects the number of crew needed to operate the vehicle; it doesn't reduce the vehicle's need for a pilot.</p>"
