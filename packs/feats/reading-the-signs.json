When you're attempting a skill check involving the drawing of cards or resolving the effects of a divination effect (including attempting a saving throw against a hostile divination effect against you), you gain a +2 status bonus to the check. When you draw a card to determine your harrow omen, perform Harrow Casting, cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Harrowing], or if you activate a magical deck of cards, draw 2 cards, and choose the one you prefer as your actual card drawn. You can even use this ability when drawing from a Deck of Many Things, but only once per deck. The unused card is shuffled back into the stack.</p>"
