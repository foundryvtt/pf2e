When you successfully counterspell an enemy's spell using Mythic Counterspell, you can learn that spell as long as it's on the spell list for your tradition. If you have a spellbook, the spell is instantly scribed into the book, creating new blank pages if needed. If you have a spell repertoire, you can instantly retrain any spell currently in your repertoire to the countered spell, though if the spell you replace is one granted to you by a class feature (such as an animist's apparition spells or a sorcerer's bloodline spells), the spell reverts to the one normally granted by that class feature during your next daily preparations.</p>"
