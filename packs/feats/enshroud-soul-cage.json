The effects have unlimited durations, are heightened to half your level rounded up, and use your spell DC against any attempt to counteract them. The magic aura makes your soul cage appear non-magical. You can ignore the effects of any of these spells when dealing with your own soul cage. You are mentally alerted whenever your soul cage is damaged.</p>"
