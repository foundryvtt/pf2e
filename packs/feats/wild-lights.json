The creature hovers over your head unless you spend a single action that has the concentrate trait to direct the light to move up to 30 feet, in which case it remains there until you direct it again. If you direct it back to your head, it hovers there and follows you again until you direct it elsewhere. If the light ever moves beyond 120 feet of you, it winks out immediately.</p>"
