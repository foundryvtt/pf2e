If your next action is to Cast a Spell that doesn't have the darkness trait, has no duration, and requires creatures to attempt a Reflex save, the spell explodes in a spray of scintillating lights, in addition to its other effects. Each creature that failed its Reflex save against the spell is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] for 1 round, and those who critically failed are instead @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Blinded] for 1 round.</p>"
