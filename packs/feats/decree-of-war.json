You and your knights are able to gain access to free food, lodging, and repairs of common items while within the affected area for the next month, as allied citizens and creatures come to your aid. During this time, you also receive at least 10-minutes' warning whenever an enemy group of more than 10 creatures travels in your direction, as allied scouts report to you.</p>"
