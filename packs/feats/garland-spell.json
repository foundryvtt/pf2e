Any creature that moves into one of these squares or ends its turn in one takes 2d6 damage (@Damage[(ternary(gte(@actor.level,20),4,ternary(gte(@actor.level,16),3,2)))d6[piercing]] damage for thorns or @Damage[(ternary(gte(@actor.level,20),4,ternary(gte(@actor.level,16),3,2)))d6[poison]] for vines).
