As an activity that takes 10 minutes, you can act as a link between disembodied souls and their mortal bodies. As long as you are in contact with both a spirit and a living body that belonged to it in life during that entire time, the spirit can use you to return to that body; this does not allow you to bring the dead back to life, but can assist in restoring a disembodied soul to a still-living body. If the body is occupied by another spirit or soul, that entity must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or be cast from the body when its original owner is returned.</p>"
