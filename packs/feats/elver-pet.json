Typically, these eels are tended until they grow large enough to serve as a mount. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pet] general feat. Instead of the normal choice of pet abilities, your eel has aquatic, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.familiar-abilities.Item.Fast Movement: Swim]{Fast Movement}, and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.familiar-abilities.Item.Damage Avoidance] familiar ability for Reflex saves. The aquatic ability means it gains the aquatic trait, breathes water instead of air, and has a swim Speed instead of a land Speed.</p>\n<p>When you aren't in an aquatic environment, you can easily carry your pet eel around in a small water-filled globe that has light Bulk.</p>"
