If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell targeting a single creature, you soak the target of the spell with water. If the target has @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Persistent Damage]{Persistent Acid or Fire Damage}, the DC to end those conditions is reduced to 10, and the creature can attempt a flat check to end those types of persistent damage immediately. The spell gains the water trait (causing it to deal extra damage to creatures with weakness to water).</p>"
