You can make any combination of melee and ranged attacks without needing to change modes to do so, though typically you can't make more than one ranged attack because of the need to reload. This counts as three attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after making all three attacks.</p>\n<p>After using Triggerbrand Blitz, you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fatigued] for 1 minute.</p>"
