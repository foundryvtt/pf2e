Make a Strike with a melee weapon or an unarmed attack against a creature, object, or a spell manifestation (such as the wall created by @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wall of Fire] or the guardian from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Spiritual Guardian]). If you're targeting something that doesn't have an AC listed, its AC is usually 10 against this Strike for targets that are very easy to hit, like a wall, or a different AC determined by the GM. If your Strike hits, you can attempt to counteract a single spell or magical effect on the target. Your counteract rank for this attempt is equal to half your level rounded up, and you use the result of your attack roll for the counteract check.</p>\n<p>Whether or not you succeed at your Strike, the target becomes temporarily immune to your Sunder Spell for 24 hours.</p>"
