When you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Consume Flesh] of a creature of your size or smaller, you can assume the physical form of the creature immediately after becoming satiated or fully satiated. Using Bodysnatcher counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception. Your transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine you are a member of the ancestry or creature type into which you transformed, and you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through your disguise. You do not gain the special abilities, skills, voice, memories, or other characteristics of the creature you consumed, only their physical form. Unlike Change Shape, Bodysnatcher can be used to gain the appearance of a specific individual whose flesh you've consumed. This effect lasts until you are no longer satiated and can only be used once per individual creature.</p>"
