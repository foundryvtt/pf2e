You make a Strike. Regardless of whether the Strike succeeds, spirits of warriors who died gloriously in battle surge out to attack with you. They appear in a @Template[type:cone|distance:30] if you make a melee Strike or in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] around your target if you made a ranged Strike. Each enemy in the area takes @Damage[(floor(@actor.level/4))d10[untyped]|options:area-damage|shortLabel] damage with a @Check[reflex|against:exemplar|basic|options:area-effect] save against your class DC; you choose whether the damage is bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. At 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d10.</p>\n<p>As they join the battle, the spirits call your fallen allies back to the fight. Any of your allies in the area who are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dying] regain Hit Points equal to the damage you rolled. This is a divine, healing, vitality effect.</p>"
