They appear in a @Template[type:cone|distance:30] if you make a melee Strike or in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] around your target if you made a ranged Strike. Each enemy in the area takes @Damage[2d10[untyped]] damage with a @Check[reflex|against:class|basic] save against your class DC; you choose whether the damage is bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. At 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the damage increases by [[/r 1d10]].</p>\n<p>As they join the battle, the spirits call your fallen allies back to the fight.
