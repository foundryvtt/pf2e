You must survive painful tests of your body and mind called reckonings, which steady your mind against all sorts of trauma. You gain resistance to mental damage equal to 1 + your number of class feats from the Hellknight Armiger archetype and other Hellknight archetypes. You become trained in Intimidation and Hell Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat except dedication feats for higher positions within the Hellknights until you have gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.ARYrFIOsT3JxpjDY]{Hellknight Armiger} archetype.</p>"
