            "value": "<p>You have trained your mind and body to tolerate polymorph magic for longer periods of time, so long as you prepare for the change appropriately. When preparing a polymorph spell that lasts 1 minute and grants a battle form, you can prepare the spell in a slot 2 ranks higher than normal. This doesn't grant any of the normal benefits of heightening a spell, but the spell lasts up to 10 minutes. For example, if you prepared animal form in a 4th-rank slot with Form Retention, you would cast a 2nd-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Animal Form] that lasts for up to 10 minutes. If the spell can be Dismissed, that doesn't change.</p>"
