Patches of your skin to flicker into glass without warning. By focusing the effect, you can concentrate the glass into a powerful protective layer of magical obsidian. Once per day, you can cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mountain Resilience] on yourself as an innate primal spell, though the spell covers you in a layer of glass instead of stone. During this innate <em>mountain resilience</em>, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Shatter Glass] reaction. At 18th level, the <em>mountain resilience</em> is heightened to 6th level instead of 4th.</p>"
