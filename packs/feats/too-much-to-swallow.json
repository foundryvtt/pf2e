You cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Untamed Form]. If you took on a new form that's too large for the effect, you automatically escape. Otherwise, you attempt to Escape. If this ends an effect where you entered the creature's space, such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.Swallow Whole], exit that creature to an adjacent area where your new form could fit.</p>"
