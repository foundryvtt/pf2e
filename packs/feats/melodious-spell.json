The trait hides only the spell's spellcasting actions and manifestations, not its effects, so an observer might still see a ray streak out from you or see you vanish into thin air.</p>\n<p>As part of using Melodious Spell, you can choose to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Create a Diversion], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Demoralize], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Perform], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Request].
