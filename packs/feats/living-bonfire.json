You conjure a bonfire in an unoccupied @Template[type:line|distance:10|width:10]{10-foot-square} space within 30 feet. The bonfire burns for 10 hours, providing all the benefits of a normal campfire. If you use this impulse again, any previous one ends.</p>\n<p>When you make a wood ranged Elemental Blast, you can have it come from the bonfire instead of you, flinging burning logs. This blast deals an additional @Damage[(floor((@actor.level -4)/5)+1)d6[fire]] damage. Each time you do this, the size of the bonfire is reduced by one 5-foot square. If all the squares are removed, the impulse ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Level (+5)</strong> The fire damage increases by 1d6.</p>"
