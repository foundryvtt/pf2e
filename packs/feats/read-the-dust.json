You immediately learn if the creature or hazard has an ability that will restore it, like rejuvenation or a haunt's reset.</p>\n<p>If it can return, you also learn the time span before its return and how to prevent that return in broad terms, such as \"lay its body to rest\" or \"destroy its armor.\" If this requires any people or objects that aren't already present, you also learn the direction towards each missing piece from the dust's movement.</p>"
