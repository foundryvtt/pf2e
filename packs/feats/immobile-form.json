Using your immobile form counts as setting up a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception, except that you can Impersonate an object instead of a creature, it gives you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through your disguise, and you add your level even if you're untrained. You can speak while in immobile form, but you can't attack, cast spells, or move.</p>"
