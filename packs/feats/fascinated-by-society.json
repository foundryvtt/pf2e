When you fail, but don't critically fail, a Society check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Recall Knowledge] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Decipher Writing], you learn the correct information (as you would on a success) and erroneous information (as you would on a critical failure). You don't have any way to differentiate which is which.</p>"
