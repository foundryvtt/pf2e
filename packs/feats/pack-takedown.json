If you and both of your active companions threaten the same creature, each of you makes a melee Strike against it. The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] against all of these attacks. If more than one attack hits, combine the damage from all successful Strikes, and apply resistances and weaknesses only once.</p>"
