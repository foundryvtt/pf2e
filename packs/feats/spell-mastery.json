Select any four spells of 9th rank or lower that are in your spellbook; each spell you select must be of a different rank. These spells are automatically prepared when you make your daily preparations, and you gain an extra spell slot for each spell. You can select a different combination of spells by spending 1 week of downtime studying your spellbook and retraining your mastered spells.</p>"
