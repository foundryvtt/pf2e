This creature appears in the same space as your familiar, which disappears for the duration of this impulse. You can Sustain this impulse up to 1 minute. When the impulse ends, the familiar appears in the space the summoned elemental occupied. A familiar can endure this process only so often-if you use this impulse on your familiar more than once per day, it dies as soon as it returns the second time.</p>"
