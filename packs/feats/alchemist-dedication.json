You also gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Alchemical Crafting] feat and four additional formulas for 1st-level alchemical items, as well as the ability to create free items during your daily preparations. Your advanced alchemy level is 1 and doesn't increase on its own.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.Ux0sa5SUBu616i5k]{Alchemist} archetype.</p>"
