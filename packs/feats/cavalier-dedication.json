You must choose an animal companion that's at least one size larger than you, but if the animal usually starts as Small, you can begin with a Medium version of that animal (changing no statistics other than its size).</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> If you have pledged yourself to a cause, you can take a second dedication feat closely tied to that cause even if you haven't taken two additional @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.nmcEiM2gjqjGWp2c]{Cavalier} feats. For instance, if you pledged yourself to fight crime with a group of vigilantes, you could take the vigilante dedication without first completing the cavalier archetype. The GM determines what archetypes, if any, are valid choices.</p>"
