This applies while Searching, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek]{Seeking}, and on the automatic secret check from Sixth Sense. You can still notice spirits only on a successful check, and you can't see them if they're more than 5 feet inside an object.</p>\n<p>When you notice a creature with your Sixth Sense, you also learn its location, making it @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] to you if it had been @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Undetected].</p>"
