This sanctum is in a location you have access to and can be part of a larger structure, such as the basement of a temple or hidden room of a library. Setting up or moving your sanctum takes a week of downtime. Your sanctum protects objects and people inside it from magical detection and the prying eyes of undead. This has the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Veil of Privacy]</em>, using your Religion modifier for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the counteract rank. Additionally, undead attempting to locate the entrance to your sanctum via mundane Perception must succeed against either your Religion DC or the normal DC to find the sanctum, whichever is higher.</p>"
