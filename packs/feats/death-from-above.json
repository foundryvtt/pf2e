Attempt an Athletics check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Leap] to a space adjacent to the target. If you land adjacent to the target, compare the @Check[type:athletics|defense:reflex] check result against your target's Reflex DC.</p>\n<p>When you leap onto a creature in this way, you do not also deal damage for falling on a creature. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your Death from Above for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target falls and lands @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone], reducing the falling damage you take by an amount equal to twice your level. You then can make a melee Strike against the target. The Strike gains the deadly d8 weapon property and deals an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage. This additional damage increases to 2d6 if you are a master in Athletics, and to 3d6 if you are legendary in Athletics.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] until the beginning of your next turn, reducing the falling damage you take by an amount equal to your level. You can then make a melee Strike against the target, adding the deadly d8 weapon property to the attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You can make a Strike against the target.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You fall prone, whether you take falling damage or not.</p>"
