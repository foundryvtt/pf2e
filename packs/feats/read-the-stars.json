Once per night, if you can clearly see the stars, you can spend 1 hour reading the heavens to see how they relate to a particular goal, event, or activity that will occur within 1 week. The GM rolls a secret check, either a @Check[type:astrology-lore|dc:28|traits:secret] check or a @Check[type:occultism|dc:32|traits:secret] check. On a success, you learn a cryptic clue or piece of advice that could help with the chosen event, and on a critical failure, you learn a misleading cryptic clue or piece of advice.</p>"
