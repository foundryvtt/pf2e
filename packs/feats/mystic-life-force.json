This creature gains knowledge of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Embodied Font] ritual to return you to your corporeal state. Until you're restored, once per hour, you can cast <em>spellsurge</em>, centered on the chosen creature. You still make all choices for the <em>spellsurge</em> and can take actions allowed by the spell, though you can take no other actions.</p>"
