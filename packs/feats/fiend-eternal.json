            "value": "<p>Through all your machinations and accumulation of power, you have completed your apotheosis and become a true archfiend. You gain the fiend and unholy traits and are immune to your realm's damage type. You don't age. Your planned realm becomes a complete reality, forming within a section of Hell, the Outer Rifts, the Netherworld, its own fiendish demiplane, or some other planar space of your choosing. If you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Seat of Power] feat, that seat of power is grafted onto your realm and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Enter Seat Of Power] activity transports you to any place within your realm; otherwise, you can enter and exit your realm in a similar fashion with a brief ritual that takes 10 minutes (though you can't bring anyone with you).</p>\n<p>Whenever you would die, you are instead reduced to 0 Hit Points, become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious], and are immediately transported to your seat of power within your realm. After 1 hour (or 1 round if you have the Seat of Power feat), you regain @Damage[5[healing]]{5 Hit Points} and reawaken. You can't leave your realm until you're fully healed or 1 week passes (whichever comes first).</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain a small group of fiendish followers who reside in your realm. They never leave your realm (though one might occasionally come to your aid if you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Marshall Fiendish Forces] feat), but they constantly spy on the mortal world to keep you informed. You are telepathically linked to these followers and can choose to speak with the group, or a specific fiend, as a three-action activity that has the concentrate trait. In doing so, you can avail yourself of the fiends' surveillance to learn about the world or current events. You can either @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Recall Knowledge] on any topic or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Gather Information]. If you critically fail to do either, you get a failure instead.</p>"
