You can't swap out Duelist Dedication or Student of the Dueling Arts in this way.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can enter a stance from a duelist archetype feat you don't have (such as one listed under Additional Feats) by increasing the number of actions it takes to enter the stance by 1 (typically to 2 actions). You must still meet the feat's prerequisites.</p>"
