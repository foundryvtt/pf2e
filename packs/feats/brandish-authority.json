This object appears in your space or in your hand, as appropriate, and remains for 1 minute. When your sign of power appears, attempt an Intimidation check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Demoralize] each enemy within 30 feet who can see or hear you. These Demoralize attempts don't take any penalty for not sharing a language. As long as your sign of power remains manifested, your enemies can't reduce the value of their frightened condition below 1.</p>\n<p>You can spend 1 Mythic Point as part of performing this action; if you do, frightened creatures grovel before you, in awe of your terrible power. At the beginning of their turn, a creature that has the frightened condition from Brandish Authority must attempt a @Check[will|against:class-spell] saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On failure, they must Drop Prone. On a critical failure, they must Drop Prone and can't Stand this turn.</p>"
