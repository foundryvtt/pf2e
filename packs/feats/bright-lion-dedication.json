You incorporate enough worship of Walkena in your daily life to avoid suspicion. You typically don't need to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Lie] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Impersonate] to pass yourself off as a worshipper of Walkena. Against careful inspection, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception checks specifically to pass yourself off as a version of yourself faithful to Walkena.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.vS9iMDapZN9uW33Q]{Bright Lion} archetype.</p>"
