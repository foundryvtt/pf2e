So long as you're holding a fan, you and allies who start their turn in a 30- foot aura emanating around you gain a +5-foot circumstance bonus to land Speed for 1 round; you also gain this bonus to your fly Speed if you possess one, but it can't grant you the ability to fly if you wouldn't otherwise be able to.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the air impedes the movements of your foes. While holding a fan, the area in a 10-foot aura emanating around you is difficult terrain for all enemies.</p>"
