If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has a range and targets one creature, increase that spell's range by 30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if the spell normally has a range of touch, you extend its range to 30 feet. In addition to the normal effects of the spell, your apparitions briefly take on semi-physical forms and attempt to drag the target toward you. The target must attempt a Fortitude saving throw against your spell DC; on a failure, it is pulled up to 30 feet directly toward you.</p>"
