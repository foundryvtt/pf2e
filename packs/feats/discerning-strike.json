Attempt a Strike against the target; if successful, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage. If you have succeeded on a Recall Knowledge check against the target during this combat and their creature type was previously recorded using @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Thorough Reports], you also deal @Damage[1[bleed]] damage. The creature is then temporarily immune to Discerning Strike for 1 day.</p>"
