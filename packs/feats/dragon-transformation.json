Add the temporary Hit Points from dragon form to any you already have from entering a rage (or any other action with the rage trait). The action to Dismiss the transformation gains the rage trait.</p>\n<p>At 18th level, you gain a +20-foot status bonus to your fly Speed, your damage bonus with dragon Strikes increases to +12, and you gain a +14 status bonus to your Dragon Breath damage.</p>"
