The spell you cast as part of the Spellstrike ignores an amount of the target's resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage equal to your level. This applies to all damage the spell deals, including @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Persistent Damage] and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell. A creature's immunities are unaffected.</p>"
