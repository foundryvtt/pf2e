When you take damage of that type, your wound smokes until the end of your next turn, preventing you from using High-Speed Regeneration.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Awakening</strong> Your regeneration can automatically save you from the brink of death. Once per day, you can use High-Speed Regeneration when your Hit Points would be reduced to 0 instead of the usual trigger.
