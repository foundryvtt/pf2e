This detects magic in your field of vision only.</p>\n<p>When you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek], you gain the benefits of a 3rd-rank <em>detect magic</em> spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.</p>"
