Make three ranged Strikes against a single target with the required weapon, each using your current multiple attack penalty, and you take an additional -2 penalty. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty, and you combine the attacks' damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>Your @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Stunning Fist] benefit applies to Triangle Shot, even though it isn't a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Flurry of Blows].
