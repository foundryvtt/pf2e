When you Prepare Elemental Medicine, you can choose to use Occultism instead of the usual skills. If you do, the medicine also grants the recipient resistance 2 and weakness 2 based on the element you chose. A wood, earth, or water elemental medicine grants resistance to void damage and weakness to vitality damage, and a living recipient loses its immunity to vitality damage for the duration. A fire or metal elemental medicine grants resistance to vitality damage and weakness to void damage, and an undead recipient loses its immunity to void damage for the duration.</p>\n<p>If you're a master in Occultism, increase the resistance and weakness to 4. If you're legendary, instead increase them to 8.</p>"
