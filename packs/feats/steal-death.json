The triggering creature reduces their doomed or dying condition by 1. For the next minute, you and your apocalypse mount gain fast healing 5 as long as you are within 10 feet of each other. If you use this reaction again within that minute, you and your mount's fast healing increases by 1, but the duration isn't increased.</p>"
