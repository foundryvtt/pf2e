Being in your Charmed Sleep counts as setting up a disguise for the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Impersonate] use of Deception (except that you Impersonate an object instead of a creature), it gives you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through your disguise, and you add your level even if you're untrained. While in your Charmed Sleep, you can be picked up and carried as easily as any small object. This effect immediately ends as soon as you wake.</p>"
