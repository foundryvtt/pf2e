Make a melee Strike against the creature who has you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Grabbed] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Restrained]. You can still make this attack even if you are restrained, though not if you are wielding a two-handed weapon. Unless your Strike is a critical failure, you can then attempt a check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape]. If the creature who has you grabbed or restrained is the target of your @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Ultimatum of Liberation], you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this check. Both the Strike and the Escape count toward your multiple attack penalty, but it doesn't increase until you've made both rolls.</p>"
