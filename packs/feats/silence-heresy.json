This prevents the target from using most auditory effects involving its voice, and it must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] to Cast a Spell with a verbal component or the spell is disrupted. If your Strike is a critical hit, the target is entirely unable to speak for 1 round and is limited to a whisper for 1 minute thereafter. Once a creature has been affected by this ability, it is temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>"
