You take 1 minute to remove your backpack, then carefully remove an item you hadn't previously declared that you purchasedâ€”you intuited that you would come to need the item and purchased it at the latest opportunity. The item must be a piece of adventuring gear, and can't be a weapon, armor, alchemical item, magic item, or other treasure. It must be common with a level no higher than half your level, and its Bulk must be low enough that carrying it wouldn't have made you encumbered.</p>"
