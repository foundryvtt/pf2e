Make a Strike; if you hit and deal damage, the creature is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1} until the end of your next turn. Then, make another Strike against the same creature. If that Strike hits and deals damage, the creature is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} until the end of your next turn. If both Strikes hit and deal damage, the duration of both conditions increases to 1 minute. Each Strike counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but you don't increase your multiple attack penalty until after you've made both Strikes.</p>"
