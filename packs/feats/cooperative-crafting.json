If an ally is attempting to Aid you with your Crafting, you ignore the â€“1 circumstance penalty if they roll a critical failure. If an ally also has the Cooperative Crafting feat, you can choose to pool your resources and work on the same item together; you can only work with 1 ally in this way. Both of you attempt a Crafting check on the same item; if you both succeed, reduce the minimum time to craft the item by 1 day. When determining the level of item you and your ally can craft, you use the higher of your level or your ally's level plus 1. If you attempt to Craft an item that's a higher level than either of you and one of you fails, both checks become critical failures instead.</p>"
