You can't cast spells (except spells your eidolon could cast), Activate or otherwise benefit from magic items that normally benefit you and not your eidolon, or use other actions it can't perform.</p>\n<p>Any of its spells you cast with limited uses count against your eidolon's uses. You can Manifest your Eidolon again to end this effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> This feat has the trait matching your eidolon's tradition (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).</p>"
