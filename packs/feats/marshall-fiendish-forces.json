The fiend appears in a place of your choosing within your manifested realm and has the minion trait. They remain for as long as your realm is manifested, until they're reduced to 0 Hit Points, or until you command them to leave, at which point they immediately vanish and return to their place of origin.</p>\n<p>At 20th level, you can choose a common fiend of level 15 or lower to appear instead when you Manifest your Realm.</p>"
