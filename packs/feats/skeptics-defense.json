If you succeed, you ignore the triggering effect, though any other creatures that were also targeted or in the area are still affected. If the source of the effect you successfully counteracted understands your language and has an Intelligence modifier of -3 or higher, that creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied] for 1 round.</p>"
