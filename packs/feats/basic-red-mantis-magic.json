You can prepare two common cantrips each day from the divine spell list or any other divine cantrips you have access to. You also gain the basic spellcasting benefits.

If you gain a Focus Pool from any Red Mantis Assassin class feats, you can Refocus by praying to Achaekek or researching your assigned kill.</p>\n<p>You also have access to the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Red Mantis Magic School]. In addition to preparing spells from the divine spell list, you can prepare spells from this school.
