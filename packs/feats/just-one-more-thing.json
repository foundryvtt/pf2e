Reroll the failed check and use the new result. If the target of the failed check is involved with one of your active investigations, double your investigation bonus from Pursue a Lead on the rerolled check. That creature is temporarily immune to Just One More Thing for 1 day.</p>\n<p>You can also use this action if you failed, but didn't critically fail, at a check to Lie, Gather Information, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Make an Impression], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Coerce]. In this case, rather than spending 1 action, adding Just One More Thing takes you half the amount of time you initially spent on the check, to a minimum of 1 more round.</p>"
