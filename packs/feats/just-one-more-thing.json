If the target of the failed check is the subject of a lead you're pursuing, double your bonus from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Pursue a Lead] on the rerolled check. That creature is temporarily immune to Just One More Thing for 1 day.</p>\n<p>You can also use this action if you failed, but didn't critically fail, at a check to Lie, Gather Information, Make an Impression, or Coerce. In this case, rather than spending 1 action, adding Just One More Thing takes you half the amount of time you initially spent on the check, to a minimum of 1 more round.</p>"
