Select a willing creature within the bright light of your nimbus. You surround the target in a protective barrier of light; this is a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] centered on the target. This barrier lasts for 1 minute, or until you Dismiss it. While the Aegis of the Innocent is active, the area of your nimbus is halved.</p>\n<p>The target gains a +1 status bonus to AC. Any enemy within the barrier, or entering the barrier, must attempt a @Check[fortitude|against:class-spell] saving throw against your class DC or your spell DC. A creature needs to attempt this save only once each round.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Item.Effect: Aegis for the Innocent]</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] for 1 round and treats the space within the barrier as difficult terrain.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature becomes dazzled for 1 minute, is pushed 10 feet, and treats the space within the barrier as difficult terrain.
