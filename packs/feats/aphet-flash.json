Each creature in its space must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] for 1 round (2 rounds on a critical failure). The swarm then glows with light like a torch until it returns to your body.</p>"
