If your Strike hits and damages an enemy, each ally within 60 feet who saw you hit can use a reaction to Stride up to twice their Speed, but each must end their Stride closer to you than where they started. Each such ally that Strides gains a +1 status bonus to their first Strike on their next turn.</p>"
