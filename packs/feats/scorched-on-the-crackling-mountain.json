You gain a black stripe down your back that looks charred. Your flat check to remove persistent fire damage is DC 10 instead of DC 15, which can be reduced to DC 5 with appropriate assistance. The first time each day you would be reduced to 0 Hit Points by a fire effect, you avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point, and your wounded condition increases by 1. Two hairs plucked from your tail can be used as flint and steel to create a fire, emitting a strange crackling sound as they ignite.</p>"
