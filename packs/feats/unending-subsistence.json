When you attempt a Society or Survival check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Subsist], you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. Succeeding at the check always provides enough food and shelter for you and up to a dozen other creatures. On a critical success, all creatures you obtain food and shelter for gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saving throws for the next 24 hours.</p>"
