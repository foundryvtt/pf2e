You create a minor explosion from your innovation, altering the combustion to cauterize wounds using vaporized medicinal herbs. You or a living creature adjacent to you regains @Damage[max(1,ceil(@actor.level/2))d10[healing]] Hit Points. In addition, the creature you heal can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of persistent bleed damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance. At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, increase the healing by 1d10.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you, though because it's not a living creature, it can't use the ability on itself.</p>"
