In addition, the creature you heal can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of persistent bleed damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance. At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, increase the healing by 1d10.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you, though because it's not a living creature, it can't use the ability on itself.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Check[type:flat|dc:17|name:Unstable Flat Check|showDC:all|traits:unstable]{Unstable Check}</p>\n<p>On a failure, the innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless) fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable actions.</p>\n<p>On a critical failure, you also take @Damage[(@actor.level)[fire]]{fire damage} equal to your level.</p>"
