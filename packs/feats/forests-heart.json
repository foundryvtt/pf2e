You call forth roots, vines, or other plant growth native to the region and can use them to make unarmed attacks. These deal @Damage[4d8[bludgeoning]] damage, are in the brawling group, and have the finesse, grapple, and reach 30 feet traits. Attacks made with these unarmed attacks don't gain additional damage from striking runes, but can benefit from the item bonus to attack rolls and property runes of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Handwraps of Mighty Blows] you wear.</p>"
