Sometimes that makes them let go, and sometimes it just makes them angrier, but either way, it's both satisfying and tasty. Make a jaws Strike against the triggering foe. On a critical hit, you are no longer grabbed. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.</p>"
