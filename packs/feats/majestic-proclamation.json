In addition to the regular effects of Demoralize, enemies become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] for 1 minute on a successful check (and also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Blinded] for 1 round on a critical success).</p>\n<p>You can use Majestic Proclamation as a single action if your previous action was Starlit Transformation.</p>"
