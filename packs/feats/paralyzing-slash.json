If you hit a living non-elf creature, it becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Paralyzed] unless it succeeds at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Regardless of the result of the save, the creature is temporarily immune to Paralyzing Slash for 24 hours. A creature that becomes paralyzed can attempt a new save to end the paralysis at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.</p>"
