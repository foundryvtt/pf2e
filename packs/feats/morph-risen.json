This accident might have drained your power, or you might have retained some of your skills, but either way, your form resists further forced transformation. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against transmutation effects, and if you roll a success on a saving throw against a hostile morph or polymorph effect, you get a critical success instead.</p>"
