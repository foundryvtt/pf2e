The triggering creature chooses whether to be moved or become off-guard. If it chooses to be moved, you choose the direction. If the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Shove] would cause it to hit a solid object, enter a square of difficult terrain, or enter another creature's space, it must become off-guard instead of being moved.</p>"
