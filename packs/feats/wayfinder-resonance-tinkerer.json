You can activate your wayfinder to cast that cantrip at will. As normal, this cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. Additionally, you can Activate your wayfinder with a Single Action (envision) activation to transform it into a nondescript pin or brooch to hide your affiliation with the Pathfinder Society. This transformation lasts for 1 hour.</p>"
