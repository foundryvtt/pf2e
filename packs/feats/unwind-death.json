Attempt a @Check[type:crafting|dc:40] check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Raise Dead]</em>, except it still has the wounded condition it had before dying, increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is then temporarily immune to Unwind Death for 1 day.</p>"
