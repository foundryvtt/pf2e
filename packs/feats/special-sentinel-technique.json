Starlit sentinel focus spells are arcane spells. You become trained in spell attack modifier and spell DC, and your spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> You can take this feat a second time, gaining the focus spell that you didn't gain the first time.</p>"
