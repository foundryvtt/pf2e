            "value": "<p>When you cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Telekinetic Hand], you can remove its duration, modify its range to 20 feet, and modify its target to be an attended object within the spell's Bulk limit that wouldn't be time-consuming to remove. Add the following to the spell's standard effects: If the creature attending the object is willing to have you take the item, mage hand carries the item to you. If the creature is unwilling, you must attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Steal] the target object with a [[/act steal]]{Thievery} check. The usual restrictions on attempts to Steal an object apply, including the restrictions that you can't steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time-consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects) and you can't Steal from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard. On a successful Steal check, the mage hand carries the item to you, and on a critical failure, you can't use this modification again for 1 hour. If you're a master in Thievery, you can attempt to Steal from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard, though if you do so, the spell's casting time increases by 1 action.</p>"
