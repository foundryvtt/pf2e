Creatures that fail this save become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] for 1 round.

Add the unstable trait to Guardian Lion Roar. The range of your roar increases to a @Template[type:line|distance:60]. Creatures that succeed (but not critically succeed) at their save also become off-guard for 1 round. On a critical failure when attempting the flat check for this unstable action, you take sonic damage equal to your level instead of fire damage.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you.</p>"
