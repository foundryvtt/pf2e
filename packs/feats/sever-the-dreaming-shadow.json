That enemy takes 80 mental damage with a basic Fortitude save against your spell DC or class DC, whichever is higher. If this reduces the creature to 0 Hit Points, the target doesn't die, but its shadow is severed from its body, becoming a shadow spawn that attempts to flee from the target's body. As long as the shadow spawn exists, the target remains in a dreamless slumber; if destroyed, the target regains its shadow and awakens (if its body was kept properly while @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious]).</p>"
