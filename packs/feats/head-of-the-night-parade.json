You Perform and cast 8th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mad Monkeys] three times, except that the spell calls various apparitions such as dancing tsukumogami or drinking oni rather than monkeys. Each casting can produce a different kind of mischief. You can Sustain all three Spells each round using a single Perform action.</p>"
