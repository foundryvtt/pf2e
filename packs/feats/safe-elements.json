When you Channel Elements or use a stance impulse that affects your kinetic aura, you can designate a number of creatures up to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 creature). Choose whether they are immune to the benefits of your kinetic aura or immune to its damage and drawbacks. You don't have to be able to see a creature to designate it, nor does it need to be in your kinetic aura, but you can't designate a creature that's unnoticed by you.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Pacifying Infusion] action.</p>"
