This information comes to you over the course of the next 1 to 2 hours, representing tidbits of information you glean from local supporters. After receiving this information, the first time you roll Initiative in an encounter with the target of your Ultimatum of Liberation or their allies, you and all your allies can make your Initiative check with mythic proficiency.</p>"
