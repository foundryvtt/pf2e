You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws until the start of your next turn. While it's raised, if you roll a success at a saving throw against a vitality or void effect, you get a critical success instead. If the religious symbol you're raising is a shield, such as with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Emblazon Armament]{Emblazon Armaments}, you gain the effects of Raise a Shield when you use this action and the effects of this action when you Raise a Shield.</p>"
