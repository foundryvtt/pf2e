You deal @Damage[1[slashing]] damage to yourself to poison a weapon you are holding. If you hit with the weapon and deal damage, the target also takes @Damage[1d4[persistent,poison]] damage. The poison on your weapon becomes inert after you hit, or at the end of your next turn, whichever comes first.</p>"
