At 18th level, the dominate is heightened to 8th level; at 20th level, it's heightened to 9th rank. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to your domination for 24 hours, though in most cases, you can't Cast the Spell again within 24 hours. If you are destroyed, all your dominate spells from Dominating Gaze immediately end.</p>"
