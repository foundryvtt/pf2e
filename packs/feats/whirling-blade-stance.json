Start from the space of the previous Strike's target to determine the range increment and whether the new target has cover. At the end of your turn, the thrown weapon flies directly back to you in a straight line. If a solid barrier blocks its path, it falls to the ground after hitting the barrier.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Item.Stance: Whirling Blade Stance]</p>"
