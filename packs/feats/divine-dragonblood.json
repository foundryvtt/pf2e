You gain the trained proficiency rank in Religion. If you would automatically become trained in Religion (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. In addition, you are endowed quick reactions. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls. If you choose a draconic exemplar, you must choose a divine dragon.</p>"
