You increase the size of any dice for the item's initial effect by one step. For instance, you could increase damage from a moderate alchemist's fire to 2d10 or healing from a moderate elixir of life to 5d8+12. Because this affects only initial dice, it wouldn't increase unarmed attack damage from a bestial mutagen, persistent damage from an acid flask, and the like. When this item is activated, the creature activating it must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:10] or take acid damage equal to the item's level.</p>"
