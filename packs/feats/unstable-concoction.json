You increase the size of any dice for the item's initial effect by one step. For instance, you could increase damage from a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Alchemist's Fire (Moderate)]{Moderate Alchemist Fire} to 2d10 or healing from a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Elixir of Life (Moderate)]{Moderate Elixir of Life} to 5d8+12. Because this affects only initial dice, it wouldn't increase unarmed attack damage from a bestial mutagen, persistent damage from an acid flask, and the like. When this item is activated, the creature activating it must succeed at a @Check[flat|dc:10] or take acid damage equal to the item's level.</p>"
