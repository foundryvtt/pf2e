Attempt a Medicine check on the dying creature as you deliver it a powerful shock. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of a level equal to the target. On a success, the creature's dying condition is reduced by 1 (or 2 on a critical success); if this reduces the value of the dying condition to 0, the creature regains @Damage[(2d8+10)[healing]] Hit Points, its wounded condition doesn't increase, and it can Stand as a free action. Each creature except you adjacent to the target takes @Damage[8d6[electricity]] damage (@Check[reflex|against:class-spell|basic] save against your class DC or spell DC); instead of attempting this save, a creature can Step as a free action and if they end this movement not adjacent to the target, they take no damage.</p>"
