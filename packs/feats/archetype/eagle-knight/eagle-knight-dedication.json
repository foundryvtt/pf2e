On the first round of combat, if you roll Diplomacy for initiative, creatures that haven't acted are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] to you. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Additional Lore] skill feat for Politics Lore. If you were already trained in Politics Lore, you also become trained in a Lore skill of your choice. You can use Politics Lore to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Make an Impression] on or make a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Request] of government officials (or similar figures) or to Gather Information about them. If you critically succeed at a check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Gather Information] with Politics Lore, you know the information without having to spend any time gathering it.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.gVipISIgPjNbOUhk]{Eagle Knight}</p>"
