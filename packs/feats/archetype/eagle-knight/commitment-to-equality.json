You rally a creature within 30 feet in an attempt to reduce its @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied] condition. If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one. When you're a master in Diplomacy, add @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled] to the list of conditions. When you're legendary in Diplomacy, add @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned] to the list of conditions; if the stunned condition has a duration instead of a value, you can't use Commitment to Equality to reduce it.</p>\n<p>Attempt a @Check[diplomacy] check against the saving throw DC of the effect that caused the condition; if there was no saving throw DC, use the hard DC for the level of the creature, hazard, or item that caused the effect. You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you're legendary in Diplomacy; even if you can, the counteract DC increases by 10. You can't treat a condition that is part of a curse or disease or is a natural state of the target. Once you attempt to treat a target's condition, that target is immune to further attempts for 1 hour, regardless of the result.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Reduce the condition's value by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Reduce the condition's value by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Increase the condition's value by 1.</p>"
