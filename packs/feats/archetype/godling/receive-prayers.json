You gain an even greater sense of your hierophant's prayers, which grants you a constant status as a constant divine spell targeting your hierophant. The spell has unlimited duration and functions at any range, included across planar boundaries, and counteracting the spell merely suppresses it until your next daily preparations, though it automatically ends if the creature stops being your hierophant.</p>\n<p>You gain the ability to cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Breath of Life] once per day as a 5th-rank divine innate spell.
