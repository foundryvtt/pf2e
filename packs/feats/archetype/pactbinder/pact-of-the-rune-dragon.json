You immediately learn 10 languages chosen from common languages, uncommon languages, and any others the dragon has access to. Additionally, you can Identify Magic at a range of 30 feet as a single action ability with the concentrate trait.</p>\n<p>In exchange, the rune dragon requires you to research a topic and send a detailed report each year. Year to year, the dragon may change the interest of your research as they see fit. If you fail to send an appropriately detailed report, you lose this ability unless you spend one week serving the dragon.</p>"
