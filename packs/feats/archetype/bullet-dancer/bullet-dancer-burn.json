While in Bullet Dancer Stance, when you make a successful ranged Strike against an opponent within your melee reach using a firearm, the next melee attack against that opponent with that weapon or a weapon attached to it deals an additional 1 fire damage and 1 persistent fire damage per weapon damage die of the attached firearm.</p>\n<p>The benefit on your next Strike from either use of Bullet Dancer Burn is lost if not used by the end of your next turn.</p>"
