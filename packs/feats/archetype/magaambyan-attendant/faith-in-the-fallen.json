Each day during your daily preparations, your <em>spirit dwelling</em> attracts a spirit wisp who comes to dwell inside. If your <em>spirit dwelling</em> contains no wisps, you can spend 10 minutes in a minor ritual to cast your <em>spirit dwelling</em> around an area and attract another wisp. Additionally, you gain a spirit wisp when a haunt or incorporeal undead creature is destroyed within 30 feet of you.</p>\n<p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Spirit Sanctification] action.</p>\n<p>Every day before your daily preparations, any spirit wisps remaining within your <em>spirit dwelling</em> from the previous day are purified and can continue along the River of Souls.</p>"
