The fiend you just struck takes @Damage[80[void]] damage with a @Check[fortitude|against:class-spell|basic] save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a critical failure, the target is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 1}. Regardless of the results of the saving throw, the target is then temporarily immune to Fiend Slayer for 24 hours.</p>"
