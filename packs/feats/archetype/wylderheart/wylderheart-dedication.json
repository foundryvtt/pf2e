You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls in encounters against fiends, and if you tie with a fiend's initiative roll, you go first.</p>\n<p>Certain wylderheart feats give you focus spells. When you gain your first wylderheart focus spell, you become trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics. Your key spellcasting attribute for the wylderheart archetype spells is Wisdom, and they're primal spells.
