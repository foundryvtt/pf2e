When you Offer a Story, you can become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] by shifting shadows for the duration instead of the normal benefits. The action then gains the shadow trait. You can't use this concealment to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Hide], as normal for concealing effects that leave your location obvious. The creature you share a story with can choose this benefit even if you did not.</p>"
