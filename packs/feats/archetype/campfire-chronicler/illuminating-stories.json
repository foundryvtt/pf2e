You receive a +1 status bonus on checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Recall Knowledge] for the duration and can Recall Knowledge about the topic of the story as a free action. The creature you share a story with can choose this benefit even if you did not.</p>\n<p>The bonus increases to +2 if you are a master of Religion and +3 if you are legendary.</p>"
