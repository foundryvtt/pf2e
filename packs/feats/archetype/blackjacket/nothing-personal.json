At 14th level, this increases to two extra dice, and at 20th level, this increases to three extra dice.</p>\n<p>You can have only one creature designated as an impediment at a time. If you use Nothing Personal against a creature when you already have a creature designated, the prior creature loses the designation, and the new impediment gains the designation.
