You can spend 1 day of downtime ending your relationship with this apparition and bonding to a new one.</p>\n<p>You gain the Cast a Spell activity. You can prepare two common cantrips each day from the divine spell list or any other divine cantrips you have access to, including the cantrip listed in your apparition's apparition spells.
