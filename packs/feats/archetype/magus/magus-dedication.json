You can prepare two cantrips each day from your spellbook. Each time you gain a spell slot of a new level from the magus archetype, add a spell of that rank or lower to your spellbook. You're trained in arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs. Your key spellcasting attribute for magus archetype spells is Intelligence, and they are arcane magus spells. You become trained in Arcana; if you were already trained in Arcana, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
