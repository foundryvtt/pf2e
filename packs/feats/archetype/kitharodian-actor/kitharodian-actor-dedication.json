You become trained in Society and in Theater Lore; if you were already trained in either, you become an expert in that skill instead. In addition, when you attempt a Deception or Performance check to portray a famous figure, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check. This bonus changes to +3 at 10th level and +4 at 17th level. However, you don't gain this bonus while Impersonating a figure whose death is common knowledge (as determined by the GM).</p>"
