You attempt a @Check[performance|dc:@self.level|adjustment:2] check to launch into a powerful monologue, pulling lines from Daronlyr's playbook to win respect from everyone around you, even your enemies. The DC of this check is a hard difficulty DC of your level. On a success, any hostile creatures within 20 feet take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and spell attack rolls that target you until the beginning of your next turn, and any allies within 20 feet are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Quickened] until the beginning of your next turn. The additional action can be only used to Strike or Stride.</p>"
