Kemen controversially shunned monastic life and instead used his martial skills as a death-defying stunt performer, winning acclaim for exhibitions that saw him survive great falls and escape deadly traps. While in this stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saving throws and skill checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape], as well as resistance 2 to all physical damage.</p>"
