This weapon acts like a <em>+1 ghost touch dagger</em>, and each successful Strike with it deals 1 additional spirit damage. If the attack is a critical hit, this damage increases to 1d6.</p>\n<p>If the <em>spectral dagger</em> ever leaves your hand, it vanishes and you must spend an action to conjure it again. If this occurs as the result of you making a ranged thrown Strike with the dagger, you resolve the attack before the weapon vanishes.</p>\n<p>You can increase the power of your <em>spectral dagger</em> with runes like you can other weapons, transferring the rune from a <em>runestone</em> or other weapon by meditating over the rune as a downtime activity that takes 1 day.</p>"
