Choose a movement type: burrow, climb, fly, or swim. You gain a Speed in the chosen movement type equal to your base Speed (or half your Speed if you selected burrow) for the duration of your spirit trance. If you use Invoke Movement again, you can choose a different movement type, but you lose the previous form of movement.</p>"
