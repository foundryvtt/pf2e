For 1 minute, you gain fast healing 5 and you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed]. You can't use this concealment to Hide. Your Strikes gain the benefits of a ghost touch property rune. Whenever you deal damage with a Strike, you can choose to have that Strike deal spirit damage, rather than its usual damage type.</p>\n<p>If you would be knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious] or your dying value would increase while One with the Spirits is active, the spirits revive you at the beginning of your next turn, restoring you to 30 Hit Points.
