The target must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, to resist your modification, which has the effects of a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Subconscious Suggestion] spell, but even on a critical success, the target doesn't realize you were trying to control them and may not recognize your presence in the dream. The suggestion remains in the target's subconscious for 1 week or until triggered. Their memories of carrying out the suggestion are hazy and dreamlike and they may not remember doing it unless later reminded.</p>"
