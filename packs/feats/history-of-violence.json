If your attack is a critical hit, you deal twice as much damage instead, and the target of your Strike takes persistent void damage equal to your key attribute modifier as your fallen foes attempt to drag the target into oblivion with them. This Strike counts as two attacks for calculating your multiple attack penalty.</p>"
