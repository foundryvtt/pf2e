You take hold of a nearby rope, throw a rope from your hand, or fire a grappling weapon at a solid surfaceâ€”and then swing up to twice your Speed. If you end your movement next to an enemy, attempt an Athletics check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Grapple] that enemy, tying them up in your rope.</p>"
