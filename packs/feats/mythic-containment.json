Spend a Mythic Point, and attempt a @Check[deception|against:will], @Check[diplomacy|against:will], or @Check[intimidation|against:will] check at mythic proficiency against the Will DC of a creature within 30 feet to trick, convince, or command it into entering the receptacle. The receptacle can hold a creature of any size, and the creature enters the receptacle if your check is successful. The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Grabbed], is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 1}, and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. A creature trapped in the receptacle can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape]; use the skill you used to lure the creature into the bag for the DC, and calculate the DC using mythic proficiency. The trapped creature is automatically freed after 1 minute, but you can spend an additional Mythic Point as a free action to prolong the duration of the containment for an additional minute when it would expire.</p>"
