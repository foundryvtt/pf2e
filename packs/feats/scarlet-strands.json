If you pluck three strands of your bright red hair and spend 1 minute braiding them together, they magically transform into a strong, 50-foot, crimson rope. This rope can hold 1,000 poundsâ€”great for lashing down sails in a storm, rappelling down a cliff to a hidden treasure, or tying up a Minkaian criminal with a sizable bounty on her head. You can have only one hair rope in existence at a time; if you braid a second, your first rope unravels back into three hairs.</p>\n<p>Your hairs can also form a net to catch fish or foes. Once per day, you can cast 4th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Web] as an innate primal spell, which takes the form of a crimson fishing net. You must have a hand free to pluck a few strands of your hair that you throw as part of the spell. The hairs regrow when the spell ends.</p>"
