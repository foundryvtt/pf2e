            "value": "<p>The fires of creation become yours to control. You create a miniature sun in a @Template[type:burst|distance:5] within 500 feet. A creature takes @Damage[7d6[fire]|traits:area-damage] damage any time it's in the miniature sun, with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.system.proficiencies.classDCs.kineticist.dc)|basic:true] save against your class DC. A creature can take this damage no more than once per round. The sun sheds bright light in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:500] (and dim light for another 500 feet); this is sunlight for creatures with a particular vulnerability to sunlight.</p>\n<p>The sun lasts until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute. The first time you Sustain the impulse each round, you can choose to increase the size of the sun's burst by 5 feet, then make it Fly up to 30 feet. The sun can move through creatures, damaging them as described above.</p>\n<p>The sun continually channels fire into you and your allies. You and each of your allies within the sun's light deal an additional @Damage[1d6[fire]] damage with all Strikes, spells that deal fire damage, and impulses that deal fire damage (except for Ignite the Sun itself). These aren't cumulative with multiple suns.</p>"
