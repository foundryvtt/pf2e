Whenever an ally within this aura takes damage, you can use your reaction to take half the damage in their stead while they take the remainder. When you take damage through this link, you don't apply any resistances, weaknesses, or other abilities you have to that damage; you simply take that amount of damage. Whenever you take damage while this effect is active, an ally within the aura can use their reaction to take half the damage for you in the same manner.</p>\n<p>The effect ends immediately if you're reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p>"
