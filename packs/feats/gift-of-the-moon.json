At 17th level, your 6th-rank <em>moon frenzy</em> grants its standard effects, except the temporary Hit Points increase to 15 and the silver weakness increases to 15. At 20th level, you cast a 10th-rank <em>moon frenzy</em> instead. The spell uses your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.</p>"
