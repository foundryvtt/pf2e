You draw an arrow (or other ammunition), whisper a short invocation over it, and then Strike with a ranged weapon. The arrow becomes a bolt of starlight, changing its damage to your choice of force or spirit and granting it the effects of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Ghost Touch]</em> rune. When the arrow Strikes its target, it unravels into a constellation of starlight that wraps around the target's limbs, imposing a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for [[/r 2d4 #rounds]]{2d4 rounds} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized]{Immobilizing} it if the Strike was critical hit. The target can untangle itself by spending an Interact action to break free.</p>"
