You can deal @Damage[1[slashing]] damage to yourself to feed someone blood from your right side and Administer First Aid or take @Damage[2d8[untyped]] damage to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Treat Disease] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Treat Wounds]; in either case, you don't need a healer's toolkit, and you gain a +1 item bonus to your check. Blood from your left side causes the check to critically fail automatically.</p>"
