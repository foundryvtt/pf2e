Whenever you are subject to <em>ring of truth</em> or a similar effect, you can attempt a @Check[deception] check when you first begin speaking to counteract the spell's effects, with a counteract rank equal to half your level (rounded up); succeeding at this check doesn't end the spell or effect, but it does cause it to indicate that you are speaking the truth, even when you are actually lying, as you weave a web of words so delicate that even you can't be certain where the truth ends and deception begins.</p>"
