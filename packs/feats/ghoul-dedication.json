            "value": "<p>You have succumbed to ghoul fever, dying and returning as a ghoul, an undead cursed with a never-ending hunger for dead flesh that slowly overrides your reason and willpower until you would do anything for the meal you crave. In addition to the personality changes, your body changes as well. Your ears become pointed, and your skin grows blueish and pale. Your fingernails sharpen into claws; your teeth become razor sharp, ready to tear flesh off the bone; and your tongue grows long and pointed.</p>\n<p>You gain the ghoul and undead traits and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.Basic Undead Benefits]. Your undead craving is for the flesh of dead creatures; freshly dead corpses from sapient creatures fulfill your cravings much more than non-sapient or rotted corpses, but any dead creature can stave off the hunger for at least a little while. You gain two unarmed attacks in the brawling weapon group. The first unarmed attack is a claw that deals 1d4 slashing damage with the agile and finesse traits, and the second unarmed attack is a set of jaws that deal 1d6 piercing damage and have the finesse trait.</p>\n<p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Consume Flesh] action. Satisfying your craving is difficult. Consuming Flesh temporarily satiates you. Many ghoul feats have extra abilities or functions that can be used when you are satiated, though using those abilities also causes you to lose your satiated status. You can always Consume Flesh, but eating more than a normal amount has no further effect; a ghoul's hunger is satiated, or it is not.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.bKoV037XO3qiakGw]{Ghoul} archetype.</p>"
