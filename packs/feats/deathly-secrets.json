You learn either the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Eyes of the Dead] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Subjugate Undead] focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can Refocus by meditating over the earthly remains of a dead sentient creature. Focus spells granted by the reanimator archetype are from the same tradition as those used to meet the archetype's prerequisite.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat more than once. Each time, you learn a different spell and your focus pool increases by 1 Focus Point.</p>"
