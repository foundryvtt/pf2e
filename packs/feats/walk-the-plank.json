You choose the path the target takes, and it does so as part of your Walk the Plank action. You can't force the target to move into a harmful space (one where it will take damage, fall, provoke reactions, or similar) unless the result of your check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Demoralize] was a critical success.</p>\n<p>The target then becomes temporarily immune to Walk the Plank for 24 hours.</p>"
