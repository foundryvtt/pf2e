As with your hearing and other imprecise senses, you still need to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] to locate an undetected creature.</p>\n<p>As spiritsense detects spiritual essence, not physical bodies, it can detect spirits projected by spells such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Project Image] or possessing otherwise soulless objects. It can't detect soulless bodies, constructs, or objects, and like most senses, it doesn't penetrate through solid objects.</p>"
