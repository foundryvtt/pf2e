You attempt a Diplomacy check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Make an Impression] against a single foe whose Hit Points are at less than half of their maximum value, followed by an immediate Request to convince that creature to cease fighting. You take a -5 penalty to your Diplomacy check. The GM sets the DC of the Request based on the circumstances; it's generally at least a very hard DC for the creature's level. Some creatures might simply refuse, and those who agree to parley might find your arguments lacking and start fighting again.</p>"
