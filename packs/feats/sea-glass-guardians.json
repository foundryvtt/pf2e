Their forms vary and might include eels formed of undulating water or ice crystals whirling in the shape of a jellyfish. The guardians flow around combatants and don't occupy a space. They attempt to intercept all dangers, granting you and your allies within your kinetic aura a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws.</p>\n<p>If any creature affected is critically hit or critically fails at a saving throw against an attack, effect from an enemy, or hazard and remains above 0 HP, the guardians reach out to heal that creature. The creature regains 4d8+8 HP, and the impulse ends.
