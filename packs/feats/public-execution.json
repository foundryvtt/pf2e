You announce your intention to kill your mark for all to hear and reveal the reason they must die, perhaps listing their crimes or sharing a damning secret. Creatures within 30 feet who can see and hear you are shocked by your proclamation or otherwise reluctant to come to your mark's aid. They must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a failure, the creature can't attack you or otherwise perform hostile actions against you until the end of your next turn. If you use a hostile action against a creature other than your mark, this effect ends. Your mark becomes temporarily immune to your Public Execution for 1 day.</p>"
