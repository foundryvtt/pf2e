This is an aura, and you choose the radius of the emanation, up to 20 feet. A creature that starts its turn in the aura or enters the aura during its turn takes @Damage[1d6[slashing]] damage for every level of the amped psi cantrip, with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. If the creature critically fails, the torn space throws it off balance and it falls @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone]. The aura lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You can choose whether the aura affects the creature emitting it.</p>"
