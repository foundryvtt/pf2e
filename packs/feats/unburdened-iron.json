Ignore the reduction to your Speed from any armor you wear.</p>\n<p>In addition, any time you're taking a penalty to your Speed for some other reason (such as from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Encumbered] condition or from a spell), deduct 5 feet from the penalty. For example, the encumbered condition normally gives a –10-foot penalty to Speed, but this feat would reduce it to a –5-foot penalty. If your Speed is taking multiple penalties, pick only one penalty to reduce.</p>"
