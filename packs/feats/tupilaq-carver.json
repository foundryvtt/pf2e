These old magics allow you to conjure constructs with ease. Add the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Summon Construct] spell to your spell list. The constructs you summon have a distinct ivory scrimshaw appearance, and if you include a drop of blood, lock of hair, or other portion of a creature's body as part of the spell's material component, the summoned construct gains a +4 status bonus to Perception checks to sense or locate that creature.</p>"
