When you or an ally in the aura critically hit an enemy with a Strike, that enemy is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 1}. If you're wielding a weapon that has more than one damage die (typically due to a striking rune), you can have the status bonus equal the weapon's number of damage dice instead of +1.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to enter the stance.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You fail to enter the stance and can't take this action again for 1 minute.</p>"
