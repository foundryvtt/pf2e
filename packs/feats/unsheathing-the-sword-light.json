Make a melee Spellstrike with a sword, with a spell that isn't a cantrip or focus spell. Countless copies of your sword, made of light, fall around you, dealing damage equal to double the spell's rank to each creature within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] of the target, excluding you and the target of the Spellstrike. The damage is of the same type dealt by your sword Strike and is treated as cold iron and silver.</p>"
