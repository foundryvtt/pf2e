Choose a language you understand to repeat the message in. The linguistic effect counts as both languages, rather than only the language the triggering creature is using, potentially allowing it to affect a wider range of creatures. As normal, you can translate normal speech without Spot Translate and without using a reaction, but this reaction allows you to apply the benefits of translation to spells and actions such as command or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Demoralize].</p>"
