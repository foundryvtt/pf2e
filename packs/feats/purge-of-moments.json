Five rounds of apparent time occur for you. No one, including you, can act during this time, but effects on you run their course, including beneficial effects, negative effects, afflictions, conditions, and persistent damage. Roll saving throws, flat checks, damage, and any other rolls for those effects normally as if the time had passed. Excessive use of this technique is responsible for more than a few premature gray hairs among time mages.</p>"
