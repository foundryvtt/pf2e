The target takes @Damage[12d6[mental]] damage (@Check[will|against:class-spell|basic] save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). If the target fails or critically fails this check, they also take @Damage[2d6[persistent,mental]] damage. For the next hour, when the target stops taking this persistent damage, you or one of your allies can mention a victim's name as a single action to the target, forcing them to succeed at another Will save or begin taking the persistent damage again. This is a curse effect. Once you use Remember Their Names on a target, the target is immune to it for 24 hours.</p>"
