Your questions must come from the following list, applying to the detail that spurred your investigation.</p><ul><li>Was this clue left by a [creature trait]? (Choose a creature trait such as humanoid, undead, or dwarf; this trait must be accurate as of the time the clue was left.)</li><li>Was this clue left within the last hour?</li><li>Was this clue left within the last day?</li><li>Was the creature that left this clue in a heightened emotional state when it left the clue?</li><li><p>Did anyone attempt to conceal this clue?</p>\n</li></ul>"
