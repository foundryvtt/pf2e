As long as this religious symbol is in your possession, when you tie an adversary's initiative roll, you go first.</p>\n<p>If you lose this religious symbol, you must purchase or Craft a replacement and attune it. Such a token usually costs at least 1 sp, and the attunement takes 10 minutes of prayer. You can also attune a different religious symbol with the same amount of time, but you lose the benefit of the previous religious symbol.</p>"
