Stride up to half your Speed upward on the required surface; if you have a climb Speed, you may use your full climb Speed instead. The surface does not need to span the full height of your Stride. You can then either make a ranged Strike at a target within your weapon's first range increment and land in the space you began (or an adjacent space) without taking falling damage, or you can land in a space adjacent to a creature within 10 feet of the required surface without taking falling damage and make a melee Strike against that creature. Either Strike deals an extra two dice of weapon damage. In addition, the target dealt damage by your Strike must succeed at a @Check[fortitude|against:class] saving throw against your class DC or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 1}.</p>"
