Whenever you critically succeed with a shattering earth attack against a creature standing on the ground in an area of difficult terrain, you pummel the creature into the earth; they become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] until they succeed at an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] attempt against your class DC.</p>"
