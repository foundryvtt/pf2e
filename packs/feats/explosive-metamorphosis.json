Your transformation creates a @Template[type:emanation|distance:5] around your new form that deals 1d6 damage of that type per rank of the spell. Each creature in that area attempts a basic Reflex save against your spell DC.</p>\n<p>If your polymorph action had a trait corresponding to an energy type, you must select that one if possible. This action gains the trait corresponding to the energy type selected.</p>"
