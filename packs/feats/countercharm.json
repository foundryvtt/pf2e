When a foe casts an enchantment or illusion spell and you can see its manifestations, you can use your own innate magic to disrupt it. You lose an innate, non-cantrip spell of the same school as the triggering spell as if you had Cast the Spell. You then attempt to counteract the triggering spell with your spell.</p>"
