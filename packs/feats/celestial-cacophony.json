All creatures in a @Template[type:cone|distance:15] extending from your innovation take @Damage[(ceil(@actor.level/2)-3)d4[fire]] damage and @Damage[(ceil(@actor.level/2)-3)d4[sonic]] damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC; both the fire and sonic damage increase by 1d4 at 14th level and every 2 levels thereafter. The area affected by the cone becomes difficult terrain until the start of your next turn. Creatures moving through this area must succeed at a @Check[reflex|against:class] save against your class DC or take @Damage[2d4[persistent,fire]] damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Unstable Function</strong> You rattle your weapon violently to make it belch out even more pyrotechnics. Add the unstable trait to Celestial Cacophony. The area increases to a 30-foot cone, and all damage dice increase from d4s to d8s.</p>"
