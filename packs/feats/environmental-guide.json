After an hour in an environment, you and up to five allies can treat the natural temperature effects of an environment as one step less severe (treat extreme cold as severe cold or extreme heat as severe heat, for instance). This reduction in severity is cumulative with any equipment (such as cold-weather gear) or spells (such as environmental endurance). If you're legendary in Survival, you may protect yourself and up to five allies, and you treat temperature effects as two steps less severe.</p>"
