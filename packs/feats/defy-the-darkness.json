You gain greater darkvision, enabling you to see through magical darkness even if it normally hampers darkvision (such as the darkness created by a 4th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Darkness] spell). You can't cast spells with the darkness trait, use item activations with the darkness trait, or use any other ability with the darkness trait.</p>"
