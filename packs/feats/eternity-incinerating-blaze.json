Whenever you score a critical hit with the imbued ikon, the target becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed]{Doomed 1} or increases its doomed condition by 1. If the target's maximum dying value is reduced to 0 by this ability, it immediately dies in a flash of spiritual fire that reduces its body to ash. This effect applies even when the ikon is not empowered. The ikon also gains the following transcendence ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Transcendenceâ€”Burn out of Time</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (spirit, transcendence, void) An impossible amount of energy blazes in a sphere above you before compressing itself into your weapon. Strike one creature. The Strike deals an additional @Damage[3d8[spirit]] damage and @Damage[3d8[void]] damage. If the creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it's immediately killed and reduced to ash, not in the present, but in the recent past, erasing the consequences of their recent actions. If a creature died within the last round as a result of the incinerated target's actions, that creature is returned to life with 5d8 Hit Points at the location that it died as its death is retroactively undone.</p>"
