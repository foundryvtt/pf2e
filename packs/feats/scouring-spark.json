Any creature that touches you or damages you with an unarmed melee attack or a non-reach melee weapon takes @Damage[3d6[fire]] damage, your unarmed attacks deal 1d6 additional fire damage, and your fire spells deal one additional die of fire damage (of the same damage die the spell uses). This damage is doubled against creatures with the aberration, fiend, or undead trait.</p>"
