You gain a spell repertoire with one cantrip of your choice, from a tradition of your choice. You choose a common cantrip or other cantrip to which you have access. This cantrip must require a spell attack roll and come from your chosen tradition. You're trained in spell attack modifier and spell DC. Your key spellcasting attribute for these spells is Charisma. Regardless of whether you can already cast spells or gained the ability from this dedication, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Eldritch Shot] activity.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.6A9zBmTyt8cn6ioa]{Eldritch Archer}</p>"
