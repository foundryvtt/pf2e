You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Cast a Spell] activity. You can prepare two cantrips each day from your spellbook. You're trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics. Your key spellcasting attribute for wizard archetype spells is Intelligence, and they are arcane wizard spells. You become trained in Arcana; if you were already trained in Arcana, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. Select a school; you don't gain any abilities from your choice of school, but qualify for feats as a member.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.XszmLWy174esRrlg]{Wizard} archetype.</p>"
