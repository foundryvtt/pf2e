The only Strikes you can make are falling stone unarmed attacks. These deal @Damage[1d8[bludgeoning]] damage; are in the brawling group; and have the forceful, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.</p>\n<p>While in Mountain Stance, you gain a +4 item bonus to AC and a +2 circumstance bonus to any defenses against @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Reposition], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Shove], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Trip], and other forced movement effects. You have a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +0, meaning you don't add your Dexterity to your AC, and your Speeds are all reduced by 5 feet. The item bonus to AC from Mountain Stance is cumulative with armor potency runes on your explorer's clothing, mystic armor, and bands of force.</p>"
