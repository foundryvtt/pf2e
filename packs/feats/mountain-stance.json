These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the forceful, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.</p>\n<p>While in Mountain Stance, you gain a +4 item bonus to AC and a +2 circumstance bonus to any defenses against being Shoved or Tripped. You have a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +0, meaning you don't add your Dexterity to your AC, and your Speeds are all reduced by 5 feet. The item bonus to AC from Mountain Stance is cumulative with armor potency runes on your @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Explorer's Clothing], <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mystic Armor]</em>, and bracers of armor.</p>"
