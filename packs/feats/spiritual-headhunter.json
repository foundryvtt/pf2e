If you kill a creature with a slashing weapon, you can decapitate it and trap the spirit of its head in your spirit coffin. Once before your next daily preparations, you can cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Talking Corpse] as a primal innate spell, which targets the spiritual head trapped in your coffin, not its physical corpse. A ghostly version of the head manifests from the coffin to answer the questions, taking a â€“2 status penalty to its Will save to resist the spell. After the spell resolves, or 1 day later, the head is released and rejoins its spiritual body. You can trap only one spirit in this way at a time.</p>"
