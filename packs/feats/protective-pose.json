As you and your eidolon pose in tandem, you each channel qi into a protective barrier in a 30-emanation until the start of your next turn. Creatures within range of either you or you eidolon gain resistance to your choice of acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage equal to half your level. In addition, any Medicine check targeting a creature with this resistance gets a +1 status bonus (or a +2 status bonus if you're a master in Medicine).</p>"
