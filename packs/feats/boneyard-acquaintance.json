You can temporarily summon it to come to your aid, and it appears as a swirling mass of ectoplasm with indiscernible features and a translucent @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Dagger], the favored weapon of Pharasma. This functions as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Spiritual Guardian], which you can cast once per day as a divine innate spell, but you don't need to worship a deity to do so.</p>"
