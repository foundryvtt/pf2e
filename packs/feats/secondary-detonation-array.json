At the beginning of your next turn, the circle detonates, dealing @Damage[1d6[force]] damage per rank of the spell to all creatures within the circle, with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. If the spell dealt a different type of damage, the circle deals this type of damage instead (or one type of your choice if the spell could deal multiple types of damage).</p>"
