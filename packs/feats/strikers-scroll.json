Attaching a scroll requires using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Affix a Talisman] action. You can have only one scroll affixed to a weapon at a time, and you can't have both a talisman and scroll attached.</p>\n<p>You can Cast the Spell from the scroll as part of a Spellstrike, assuming the spell is one you could normally use with Spellstrike. You can't Cast the Spell in any other way while it's affixed, though you can use Affix a Talisman again to remove the scroll and use it as a normalâ€”if a bit crumpled-scroll.</p>"
