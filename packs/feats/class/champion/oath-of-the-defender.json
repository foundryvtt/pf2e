You gain an edict to defend against creatures of that kind.</p>\n<p>Allies in your champion's aura, not including you, get resistance 2 to damage dealt by creatures with the chosen trait. If such a creature deals more than one damage type at once, apply this resistance only to the highest amount of damage.
