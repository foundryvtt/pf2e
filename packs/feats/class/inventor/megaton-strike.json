The type of Strike you can make depends on your innovation.</p><ul><li><strong>Armor</strong> You Strike with a melee unarmed attack or a melee weapon. To use a melee weapon for this, you must have prepared it in advance with special contraptions when you make your daily preparations.</li><li><strong>Construct</strong> Your minion innovation Strikes.</li><li><strong>Weapon</strong> You Strike with your weapon innovation.</li></ul><p><strong>Unstable Function</strong> You put even more force into the Strike, though you risk stress fractures to your innovation.
