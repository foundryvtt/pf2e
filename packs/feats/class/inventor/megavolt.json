Creatures in a @Template[line|distance:20] from your innovation take @Damage[(max(3,floor(@actor.level/2)))d4[electricity]|options:area-damage] damage, with a @Check[reflex|against:inventor|basic|options:area-effect] against your class DC. The electricity damage increases by 1d4 at 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter.</p>\n<p><strong>Unstable Function</strong> You overload and supercharge the voltage even higher. Add the unstable trait to Megavolt. The area increases to a @Template[line|distance:60] and the damage increases from d4s to d12s. If you have the breakthrough innovation class feature, you can choose a 60-foot or @Template[line|distance:90] for the area when you use an unstable Megavolt; if you also have the revolutionary innovation class feature, you can choose a 60-foot, 90-foot, or @Template[line|distance:120].</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you.</p>"
