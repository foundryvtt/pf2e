The weapon also gains the deadly d8 trait; if the weapon already had the deadly trait, the damage die increases by one step or to d8, whichever is higher. The first time you use this weapon to Spellstrike or get a critical success on an attack with it, the weapon is completely destroyed.</p>\n<p>If the weapon has a Hardness greater than your level, or if it's an artifact, cursed item, or other item that's difficult to break or destroy, it is not destroyed, and this ability only lasts until the end of your turn.</p>"
