You gain a familiar, which has your choice of either the plant or fungus familiar ability; this doesn't count against your usual limit of familiar abilities (typically 2). The spirit you call has a more tenuous connection to its plant body than fully independent leshies, so it is Tiny in size like other familiars.</p>"
