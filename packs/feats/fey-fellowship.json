You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to both Perception checks and saving throws against fey.</p>\n<p>In addition, whenever you meet a fey creature in a social situation, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Make an Impression] on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a â€“5 penalty to the check. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.</p>"
