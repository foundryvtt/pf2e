            "value": "<p>Ranik Helt knows a special technique to hide his spells as part of a performance, and you've learned this technique. Ostentatiously performing, you move across the battlefield, taking foes aback and creating an opening for your spell. Attempt a @Check[type:performance] check against all observers' Perception DCs. Then, Stride once or twice. During this movement, you don't trigger reactions that are triggered by your movement from the creatures against which you succeeded on your Performance check. After your movement, you can Cast a Spell. If you used one Stride, you can cast either a 1-action or a 2-action spell; if you used two Strides, you can only cast a 1-action spell. If you critically succeed on your check against any creature, they take a â€“1 circumstance penalty to their saving throws against any spell you cast as part of your Helt's Spelldance due to your distracting performance. All creatures that observed you become temporarily immune to your Helt's Spelldance for 10 minutes.</p>"
