Attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Demoralize] the creature whose precious item you threaten. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the Intimidation check to Demoralize, and on a success, the creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Flat-Footed] for 1 round out of distraction for the object's safety and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 minute (or stupefied 2 on a critical success). These conditions are both in addition to the normal effects of Demoralize. The creature is then temporarily immune to any Idol Threat using that specific object for 1 day.</p>"
