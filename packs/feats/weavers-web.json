When your swarm ends its turn, it fills all surfaces in its space with sticky webs that last for 1 minute. The webs are difficult terrain. A creature that ends its turn in the webs must succeed at a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] save or be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] until it @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape]{Escapes}. The webs' save DC and Escape DC are equal to the higher of your class DC or spell DC. The swarm is immune to its webs.</p>"
