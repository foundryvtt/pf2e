When your swarm ends its turn, it fills all surfaces in its space with sticky webs that last for 1 minute. The webs are difficult terrain. A creature that ends its turn in the webs must succeed at a Reflex save or be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] until it Escapes. The webs' save DC and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] DC are equal to the higher of your class DC or spell DC. The swarm is immune to its webs.</p>"
