The powerful filtration properties of this coral protect you from impurities. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against poisons, and your flat check to remove persistent poison damage is DC 10 instead of DC 15, which is reduced to DC 5 if another creature uses a particularly appropriate action to help. You must submerge yourself in water once every 24 hours to hydrate your coral or you lose the bonuses granted by the symbiotes.</p>"
