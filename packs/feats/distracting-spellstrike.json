Make a Spellstrike and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Feint] against the target of your Strike. Do this immediately before making the Strike, but after choosing your target.</p>\n<p>The Feint gains the arcane, illusion, and visual traits, and it always has the basic effects of a Feint, rather than applying any adjustments or alternate effects from other feats or abilities.</p>"
