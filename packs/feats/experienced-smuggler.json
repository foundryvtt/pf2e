When the GM rolls your Stealth check to see if a passive observer notices a small item you've @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed], the GM uses the number rolled or 10—whichever is higher—as the result of your die roll, adding it to your Stealth modifier to determine your Stealth check result. If you're a master in Stealth, the GM uses the number rolled or 15, and if you're legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item from passive observers. This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception check while actively searching you for @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] items.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>PFS Note</strong> This feat allows you to Earn Income with Underworld Lore with tasks of your level -1 (instead of the normal level -2).</p>"
