Spend a Mythic Point, and choose one opponent within 30 feet; you declare a Fated Duel against that opponent.</p>\n<p>If the opponent accepts your challenge, you're locked in mystical combat together. Neither you nor your opponent can move more than 30 feet from each other; you both can't be harmed by any creature other than each other; and you both can't harm any creature other than each other. This mystical bond is incredibly draining on both parties, pulling at their life and spirit; if neither you nor your opponent has defeated the other by the time 1 minute has passed, you both become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed]{Doomed 1}. Your doomed conditions increase by 1 for each additional minute that passes until one or both of you die.</p>"
