During an encounter, even if you don't use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Command an Animal] action, your mount can still use 1 action that round on your turn to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Stride] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Strike]. It can do this at any point during your turn, as long as you aren't currently taking an action. If it does, that's all the actions it gets that roundâ€”you can't Command it later.</p>"
