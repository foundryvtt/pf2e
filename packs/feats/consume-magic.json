Attempt a counteract check against the triggering effect; your counteract rank equals half your level (rounded up), and for the roll, use either your class DC â€“ 10 or your spellcasting attribute modifier plus your spellcasting proficiency bonus. If you counteract the triggering effect, you end the effect for all other creatures in the area, but you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1} as your body struggles to absorb the influx of magic.</p>"
