If it hits and deals damage, you can attempt an Athletics check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Trip] the creature you hit. If you're wielding a two-handed melee weapon, you can ignore Trip's requirement that you have a hand free. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both of them.</p>"
