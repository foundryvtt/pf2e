Surfaces in your kinetic aura are coated in slippery ice. A creature that moves on the ice immediately falls unless it succeeds at an Acrobatics check or Reflex save against your impulse DC – 2. A creature that Steps or Crawls doesn't have to attempt a check or save. You're immune to this effect.</p>\n<p>If a creature on the ice is critically hit by one of your water impulses or critically fails at a save against one, that creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 1} until the end of its next turn.</p>"
