You don't immediately fall at the end of a jump, provided you Leap again with your next action. If you Leap over a creature and come within 10 feet, that creature takes @Damage[(floor((@actor.level -6)/5)+2)d6[fire]] damage with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.system.proficiencies.classDCs.kineticist.dc)|basic:true] save against your class DC.</li>\n<li>At the start of each of your turns, you can emit steam as a free action. It deals @Damage[(floor((@actor.level -6)/5)+2)d6[fire]] damage to each creature in your kinetic aura with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classDC.value)|basic:true] save against your class DC.
