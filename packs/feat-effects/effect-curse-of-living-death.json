            "value": "<p>Granted by @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bones]</p>\n<h3>Curse of Living Death</h3>\n<p>Your body is slowly decaying even though you are alive, and using your powers furthers this unnatural living death. You carry a touch of the grave about you, manifesting as bloodless pallor, a faint smell of earth, or deathly cold skin.</p>\n<h4>Minor Curse</h4>\n<p>Bones protrude through your skin and your flesh rots, combining with a stench of decay and an unearthly chill. Non-magical effects that would restore your Hit Points only grant you half as many HP as normal.</p>\n<h4>Moderate Curse</h4>\n<p>Your dead flesh continues to rot, affecting your health. You become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 1}, and this drained condition is cumulative with any other drained conditions you gain. This drained condition is removed only when you Refocus; effects that normally remove the drained condition reduce your drained condition to drained 1 instead.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain resistance to poison equal to half your level. You gain a +4 status bonus to saves against diseases, poisons, and death effects, and if you roll a success on such a save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h4>Major Curse (11th)</h4>\n<p>You stand just steps from the grave. You become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Wounded]{Wounded 1}. This wounded condition is removed only when you Refocus; effects that normally remove the wounded condition reduce your wounded condition to wounded 1 instead.</p>\n<p>When you would attempt a recovery check, you can choose to get an automatic success instead of rolling, and if you roll a critical failure on a save against a disease, poison, or death effect, you get a failure instead.</p>"
