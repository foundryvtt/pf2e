After taking the damage, you gain weakness to the energy type of your backlash until your next daily preparations. The weakness is equal to one-third of your level.

You deal [[/r (@actor.level)d6]]{1d6 damage per level} to all creatures in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30] with a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)|basic:true] save.
