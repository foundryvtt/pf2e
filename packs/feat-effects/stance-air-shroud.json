This doesn't displace other matter but provides air for creatures in your kinetic aura that need air to breathe. Attacks with ranged weapons take a -1 circumstance penalty to their attack rolls if their paths pass through your kinetic aura. Air in your kinetic aura is difficult terrain for flying creatures other than yourself.</p>"
