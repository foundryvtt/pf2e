Fast-moving gray clouds surround you, as well as your allies while they're in your kinetic aura. Anyone surrounded by these clouds gains a +2 status bonus to Reflex saves and Acrobatics checks. When an affected creature uses a move action, clouds dance around it. Until the start of its next turn, it's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed], and its Strikes gain the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Shock]</em> rune.</p>"
