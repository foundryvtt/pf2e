Their forms vary and might include eels formed of undulating water or ice crystals whirling in the shape of a jellyfish. The guardians flow around combatants and don't occupy a space. They attempt to intercept all dangers, granting you and your allies within your kinetic aura a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws.</p>\n<p>If any creature affected is critically hit or critically fails at a saving throw against an attack, effect from an enemy, or hazard and remains above 0 HP, the guardians reach out to heal that creature. The creature regains 4d8+8 HP, and the impulse ends. If the creature is in water, the healing dice are d10s instead of d8s.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Level (+3)</strong> The healing increases by 1d8+4.</p>\n<p>[[/r ((floor((max(12,@actor.level)-12)/3)+4)d8+(floor((max(12,@actor.level)-12)/3)*4+8))[healing]]]{Leveled HP}</p>"
