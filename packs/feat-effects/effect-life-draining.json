If you spend this time basking in sunshine, it instead takes 10 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Severe Backlash</strong> You become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 3} until you spend 2 hours napping. While napping, you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious] and can't take actions or engage in exploration activities, but a creature can wake you with a single action with the manipulate trait.
