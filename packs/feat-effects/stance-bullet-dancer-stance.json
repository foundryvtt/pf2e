You can use Flurry of Blows with these weapons. You can use other monk feats or monk abilities you have that normally require unarmed attacks with bayonets, reinforced stocks, and the melee component of simple combination weapons, so long as the feat or ability doesn't require a single, specific Strike. You can also use them with simple firearms when attacking within half the first range increment.</p>"
