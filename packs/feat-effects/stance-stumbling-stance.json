While in this stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Feint].</p>\n<p>The only Strikes you can make are stumbling swing unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. If an enemy hits you with a melee Strike while in this stance, it becomes off-guard against the next stumbling swing Strike you make against it before the end of your next turn.</p>"
