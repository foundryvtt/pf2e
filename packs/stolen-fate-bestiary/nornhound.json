These wolves gain a portion of the same power over fate that norns do and serve their norn masters with unflinching loyalty.</p>\n<h2>Nornhound Packs</h2>\n<p>Long-lived or powerful norns sometimes spin multiple nornhounds and keep entire packs as guardians. These packs make quick work of intruders and also gain additional powers when working together. Much like a norn triumvirate, a norn pack can their powers to affect the flow of time in a localized area or even stop time outright.</p>",
