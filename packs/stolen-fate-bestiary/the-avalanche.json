The amount and type of damage dealt are based on the nature of the natural disaster the Avalanche unleashes, and certain types of disasters impose additional effects. The Avalanche can't unleash the same type of disaster twice in a row. The sturzstromer is immune to these effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Earthquake</strong> The ground in a @Template[type:burst|distance:20] violently shakes and launches rubble in the area, dealing @Damage[(3d12+20)[bludgeoning]] damage. On a failure, the creature also stumbles back 5 feet, away from the Avalanche. On a critical failure, the creature stumbles back 10 feet and is knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone].</p>\n<p><strong>Fire Rain</strong> A hail of burning rock rains down in a @Template[type:burst|distance:20], dealing @Damage[(3d12+20)[fire]] damage. Creatures that fail their save catch on fire and take @Damage[2d6[persistent,fire]] damage (double on a critical failure).</p>\n<p><strong>Landslide</strong> A mass of rubble falls in a @Template[type:burst|distance:20], dealing @Damage[9d8[bludgeoning]] damage. Creatures that critically fail their save become trapped under this rubble as if it were an avalanche, except a creature can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] from beneath the rubble (DC 40).</p>\n<p><strong>Lava Channel</strong> A burst of molten rock violently spews forth in a @Template[type:line|distance:30|width:10]{30‑foot‑long and 10‑foot‑wide line}, dealing @Damage[9d8[fire]] damage. Creatures that fail their Reflex save are swept 15 feet away by the lava (30 feet on a critical failure). The lava cools almost instantly, allowing creatures to walk over its path immediately after resolving the effects of the disaster.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Winds</strong> A massive burst of wind travels in a @Template[type:line|distance:60], kicking up dust and dealing @Damage[(3d12+20)[slashing]] damage. Creatures that fail their Reflex save become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] for 1 round and also fall prone on a critical failure.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature takes no damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes full damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature takes double damage.</p>"
