The Avalanche can't unleash the same type of disaster twice in a row. The sturzstromer is immune to these effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Earthquake</strong> The ground in a @Template[type:burst|distance:20] violently shakes and launches rubble in the area, dealing [[/r (3d12+20)[bludgeoning]]] damage. On a failure, the creature also stumbles back 5 feet, away from the Avalanche. On a critical failure, the creature stumbles back 10 feet and is knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone].</p>\n<p><strong>Fire Rain</strong> A hail of burning rock rains down in a @Template[type:burst|distance:20], dealing [[/r (3d12+20)[fire]]] damage. Creatures that fail their save catch on fire and take [[/r 2d6[persistent,fire]]] damage (double on a critical failure).</p>\n<p><strong>Landslide</strong> A mass of rubble falls in a @Template[type:burst|distance:20], dealing [[/r 9d8[bludgeoning]]] damage. Creatures that critically fail their save become trapped under this rubble as if it were an avalanche, except a creature can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] from beneath the rubble (DC 40).</p>\n<p><strong>Lava Channel</strong> A burst of molten rock violently spews forth in a @Template[type:line|distance:30|width:10]{30‑foot‑long and 10‑foot‑wide line}, dealing [[/r 9d8[fire]]] damage. Creatures that fail their Reflex save are swept 15 feet away by the lava (30 feet on a critical failure). The lava cools almost instantly, allowing creatures to walk over its path immediately after resolving the effects of the disaster.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Winds</strong> A massive burst of wind travels in a @Template[type:line|distance:60], kicking up dust and dealing [[/r (3d12+20)[slashing]]] damage. Creatures that fail their Reflex save become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] for 1 round and also fall prone on a critical failure.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature takes no damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes full damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature takes double damage.</p>",
