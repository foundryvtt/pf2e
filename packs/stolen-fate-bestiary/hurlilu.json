The demon lord and his minions claim the air around the cliff, guarding it against enemies and usurpers alike. Hurlilus, resembling horned, humanoid hawks with blood-red taloned feet and wings in place of arms, patrol these skies at their lord's command. Yet, hurlilus are surly and rebellious by nature, preferring to lead rather than follow orders. They'd prefer to spend their time bullying smaller creatures in High M'Vania's vast cliffside cities, but they're unwelcome there and driven out when discovered by occupants with greater authority (or by those who want to earn greater authority).</p>\n<p>Hurlilus make good guardians, particularly when they have leave to travel over great distances on patrol routes and can engage in spontaneous cruelty if the opportunity arises. However, they chafe in Pazuzu's service. Some forsake High M'Vania entirely and migrate to other parts of the Abyss, where they lead gangs of lesser fiends they've bullied into submission. A few hurlilus have made their way to Golarion, where they roost in aeries with subservient harpies, manticores, or other foul flying creatures. A dozen or so hurlilus serve high positions in the Mivanians, the brutal enforcers of the Halana Theocracy.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The hurlilu is the weakest and smallest of the avian fiends collectively known as lilus. All lilus are chaotic evil fiends who can fly, are immune to disease, have mixed avian and humanoid appearances, possess darkvision and lifesense, and resist physical damage (except from cold iron). Most have a selection of primal innate spells (often including a primal version of <em>dimension door</em>).</p>",
