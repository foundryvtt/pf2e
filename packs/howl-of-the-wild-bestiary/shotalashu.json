Both elves and lashuntas have brought shotalashus to Golarion, though elves are somewhat more likely to sell or give them away.</p>\n<p>Mounted combatants covet these alien creatures, though taming one is not as simple as buying a horse or camel. A shotalashu must form a telepathic bond with their rider before any riding is permitted, and once the creature forms such a bond, they will not permit any other rider. While telepaths have the easiest time forming this bond, others have found ways to prove their worth.</p>\n<p>Any shotalashus encountered in the wilds of Golarion most likely escaped from captivity—a notable wild pack exists on the Isle of Kortos, descended from such runaways. Would-be riders are most likely to find available shotalashus in Absalom, Kyonin, and southern Garund. Shotalashus are extravagantly expensive to raise on Golarion, resulting in corresponding prices when they appear on the market. However, the friends of riders who've passed will often help the surviving shotalashus find a new rider once they're ready.</p>",
