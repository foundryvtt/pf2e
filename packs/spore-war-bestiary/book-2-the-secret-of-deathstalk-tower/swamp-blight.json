When building an encounter with a swamp blight, consider adjusting existing undead to match more thematically with the swampland environment, and avoid using undead that wouldn't make sense in such a region. Adjusting an undead creature's innate spells to be primal spells associated with swampy regions is a great way to achieve this customization.</p>",
