If the target creature speaks any of these languages, it hears the whispers in the tongue it is most comfortable speaking. If the target does not speak these languages, the trap's whispers have no effect. If the target understands the whispers, the trap casts suggestion on the target (@Check[type:will|dc:25] save), suggesting they \"stand guard before the door and fight any who attempt to pass by it to enter the chamber beyond until Mistress Liralarue's arrival.\" Once, the whispers also alerted Liralarue, but as she is long gone now, the PCs don't need to fear the arrival of a powerful runelord's apprentice.</p>"
