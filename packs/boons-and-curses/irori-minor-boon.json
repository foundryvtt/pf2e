Once, when you roll a failure at a check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Recall Knowledge], you get a critical success instead. Furthermore, the check loses the secret trait, so you know for sure that the result was a critical success. Irori typically grants this boon for an extremely consequential check to Recall Knowledge.</p>"
