Such a creature or object takes @Damage[10d6[void]] damage each round you continue touching it; the damage ignores all Hardness and is capable of destroying nonliving objects, creatures immune to void effects, and even undead or other creatures with void healing. This boon might even be able to destroy some artifacts that have survived past their time.</p>"
