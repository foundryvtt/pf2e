Such a creature or object takes [[/r 10d6[negative]]]{10d6 negative damage} each round you continue touching it; the damage ignores all Hardness and is capable of destroying nonliving objects, creatures immune to negative effects, and even undead or other creatures with negative healing. This boon might even be able to destroy some artifacts that have survived past their time.</p>"
