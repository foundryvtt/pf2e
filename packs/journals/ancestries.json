Though they act in many ways like natural-born shapeshifters, their twin forms actually stem from carefully developed magic.</em></p><hr /><p>As a communal and peaceful people, anadi ancestors endeavored to establish trade with the neighbors of ttheir homeland. However, these anadi soon learned that most others found their appearance to be extremely objectionable. Wishing to avoid conflict, ancient anadi retreated into isolation until they could find a solution. The answer came when their greatest scholars innovated a fusion of transmutation and illusion magic that allowed them to assume a humanoid form. The technique was developed, perfected, and eventually taught to the overwhelming majority of anadi.</p><p>Early efforts with their new approach to diplomacy have yielded much better results, though sporadic contact means that some outsiders whisper false legends about anadi, such as claims that they are humans who transform into monstrous spiders at moonrise. Even contemporary explorers have reported anadi as human-spider hybrids. The anadi people of the current day strive to slowly but surely create a world where they no longer need to hide their true nature.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Only reveal your true form to people who have earned your trust.</li><li>Openly express sympathy for misrepresented and unfairly stigmatized cultures.</li><li>Provide for those you hold dear and defend them from danger without hesitation.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Appreciate your willingness to seek nonviolent solutions to complicated problems.</li><li>Have a strong reaction to seeing your natural form.</li><li>Assume you have an affinity for druidic magic, given your ability to transform.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Anadi in their true form resemble human-sized spiders with a variety of colorations. Some tones look simple or muted while other remain striking and vibrant, with most patterns inherited from an anadi's parentage. A typical anadi measures five feet in length from their front legs to their rear legs when standing comfortably.</p><p>All anadi possesses the ability to transform into a human guise. This form can resemble any human ethnicity, but it's usually one that blends in with the region of an anadi's hatching. Anadi reach physical maturity after 13 years, going through multiple phases of molting along the way. A typical anadi lives to be about 80 years old.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Anadi live in a communal society, sharing peaceful lives farming mushrooms or weaving warm blankets. Their culture places great value on cooperation and mutual respect. Due to this cultural upbringing, anadi often have issues facing severe conflict and often come off to other ancestries as very shy. Their history of dealing with arachnophobia in other peoples-which anadi understand is often instinctual and very difficult to control-likewise means that anadi do their best to be accommodating and comforting, even in situations that aren't necessarily fair to them.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>The cooperative nature of anadi society and their dislike of violence means many anadi lean toward good alignments. They're more often neutral than chaotic or lawful, though the latter aren't unheard of.</p><p>Legends say Grandmother Spider rescued anadi people from servitude and brought them to Golarion, becoming their patron deity in the process. Her values of mutual care and playful trickery interweave into anadi culture, and even those who don't worship her tell tales of her adventures.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Anadi names are given by the members of the web marriage that raised them. Each parent contributes a single syllable, usually the first, from their own name. Older anadi who feel their identity has settled often take on or are given a phrase-title to honor them as well. Anadi who live among human populations rarely take a cover name, but some might adopt one if their given name strongly contrasts the norm in the local culture.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Altava, Anavachti, Strings-On-The-River Inkeelah, Kerialnamu, Maracha, Leaves-Shelter-Her-Feet Naiala, Orvasa, Reloana, Rivuken, Velachamon</p><h2>Anadi Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Wisdom, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Constitution</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Anadi, Mwangi</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

                "content": "<p><em>Technological wonders from another world, androids have synthetic bodies and living souls. Their dual nature makes them quick-thinking and calm under pressure, but comfortable in stillness and solitude.</em></p><hr /><p>Androids first arrived on Golarion during the Rain of Stars, when an interstellar vessel from the far-off planet of Androffa crash-landed, scattering debris across Numeria. While some android survivors of this crash still walk Golarion today, most were created from the technological pods, known as foundries, that operate sporadically amid the starship's wreckage. Androids birthed from these mechanical wombs possess mature bodies and newborn souls, both organic and synthetic; they emerge knowing only their creators' language and the motor skills necessary for survival. They have no understanding of their surroundings, origin, or purpose. Most learn how to behave through keen observation while wandering Numeria.</p><p>Androids tend to be logical introverts, rational and contemplative. Insatiably curious, with an urge to understand themselves and the world around them, androids place great value on intellectual pursuits. They have difficulty interpreting and expressing emotions, both in themselves and in others, which makes them seem distant and uncaring. While androids can forge emotional bonds, they find it more difficult to connect with non-androids.</p><p>If you want a character that's a synthetic foreigner in a fantastic world, forced to learn the nuances of reality and society through the powers of observation and logic alone, you should play an android.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Keep your identity a secret, assuming others want to exploit or harm you.</li><li>Plan ahead, preparing multiple contingencies for even simple tasks.</li><li>Calculate the repercussions of your actions, inventions, and thoughts before sharing them.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Assume you understand how to operate technology and that you can capably communicate with constructs and robots.</li><li>Believe you to be immortal and envy your eternal youth and vigor.</li><li>Think you have no feelings and that you can't form emotional connections with others.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Androids were created in humanity's image; thus, foundries produce androids that represent all humankind. Androids display great diversity in coloration and ethnicity, height and body shape, and gender identity. Androids breathe, eat, and sleep like a human, although they're incapable of biological procreation. Their bodies contain microscopic nanites, transported by fluid too watery to be blood, that manage their organic processes. These nanites are controlled through biological circuitry that resembles tattoos and is typically located along an android's hands, forearms, face, or neck. Many androids can harness their nanites to increase their bodies' efficiency, causing the circuitry to glow.</p><p>Androids don't grow old. Instead, their organic appearance becomes less convincing over time, causing them to look more artificial. After a century, most androids feel their time coming to an end and willingly release their souls to the Boneyard to face Pharasma's judgment. Their bodies then shut down, entering a lifeless hibernation as their nanites begin restoration protocol and reset their synthetic bodies to their original manufactured state. After a few weeks, a new soul enters the android's form, triggering reinitialization. This process, called Renewal, is an event to be celebrated, akin to bearing a child. Those that die by violence can't Renew, so androids go to great lengths to protect themselves and their brethren from harm.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Androids have a history of being exploited, enslaved, and destroyed by their Numerian neighbors, so they hide in order to survive. Most choose to keep their ancestry secret by integrating into human society or by adapting to a nomadic lifestyle. Some androids eschew humanity to live among their kind. Such groups often remain small by necessity; while a pair of androids can avoid danger through careful secrecy, large groups attract too much attention.</p><p>Android communities are efficient and highly organized. Each citizen understands their role and takes pride in filling it effectively. Debates and lectures frequently occur, as androids seek to understand themselves and their world through education and inquiry. These insular and secretive enclaves relocate when discovered.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Most androids are neutral. They care for their own safety and that of their companions and their kind. Androids interested in religion usually worship Casandalee or Brigh, goddesses that unite invention and life. Other popular deities include Desna, Irori, and Gozreh.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Androids adopt the naming conventions of their surrounding societies, while those raised among their own kind instead select a single name that utilizes Androffan phonology. Occasionally, such androids add a numerical designation to their names, denoting how many generations their body has hosted life as a kind of homage to their bloodline.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Anati, Daniv, Era-4, Feralia, Gelegor, Ilgos-5, Koresh, Oris, Prime, Urdun, Verity-3, Ymry</p><h2>Android Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Androffan</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

                "content": "<p>Athamarus are fish-like humanoids who form tight-knit undersea communities. In small settlements, they engage in the subsistence farming of seaweed, train eels to serve as mounts, and create elaborate works of coral art. Their interactions with other aquatic ancestries are strained, as athamarus have suffered mistreatment at their hands. However, they remain curious about potential connections and what new opportunities may offer.</p><p>Athamarus define themselves by their connections to the world around them. They live in communal settings among coral reefs and aquatic companion creatures that encourage large families and friend groups. Athamaru settlements established near river or sea trade routes usually maintain strong relationships with the sailors who regularly pass by, exchanging coral jewelry or information about nearby sea routes for surface goods, especially root foods like tubers, yams, and other vegetables, which they see as delicacies.</p><p>If you want to play a character who values community and survives the sea through effort alone, you should play an athamaru.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Value your community above most everything else.</li><li>Approach strangers with warm curiosity.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Assume you're well versed in underwater survival.</li><li>Believe you're to blame for foul smells.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Athamarus have a distinctive appearance that resembles fish. Their brightly colored skin often matches the reefs where they build their communities. Frills, barbels, and crested fins add to their flamboyant appearance. The sheer variety of crest shapes, scale patterns, and fin styles make individuals distinct, even as communities share features. These similarities are often environmentally advantageous, such as scales that allow them to blend into seaweed or longer toes in areas with stony seabeds.</p><p>Outsiders often note that athamarus have a distinctive smell, which comes from pheromones, used for both communication and defense. While the level of control varies, all athamarus can communicate basic emotions chemically, and individual settlements have unique variations to their pheromones that serve as a community fingerprint. Masters of pheromonal expression can communicate complex philosophical concepts purely chemically, occupying a role similar to master singers in other communities.</p><p>Athamarus value natural adornments that blur the lines between body modifications and jewelry. In areas where coral grows, tending reefs and their symbiotic species are highly valued tasks. Some fashion still-living specimens into earrings or cuffs, then gently guide the coral as it continues to grow. These pieces often stay in circulation for generations and are valued as living community history. Other uses of coral include integrating pieces in with the wearer's body in symbiosis, the coral providing nutrients and the athamaru ensuring access to sunlight and quality water.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The largest population of athamarus lives in the underwater nation of Xidao in Tian Xia. There, smaller city-states follow their own government and leaders, though they have vowed to protect one another from the terrors of the deep should the need arise. The largest city-state, Yashabaru, has no direct control over the other settlements, but its leader serves as a figurehead for the region. Outside of Xidao, communities are more isolated and independent, though population centers include the Shackles, a reclusive settlement near Sedeq, and the large gulfs of Arcadia.</p><p>The smallest individual athamaru settlements might have only a dozen members, while the largest house hundreds. Athamaru communities connect with other aquatic inhabitants to build strong bonds that improve the quality of life for everyone involved. Animals are integrated into their communities as partners, particularly the domesticated eels that athamarus use as steeds. The eels generally roam freely, and athamarus train mounts from newly hatched elvers they raise.</p><p>Each community consists of genetically related athamarus, typically all born from a single parent. In most settlements, the parent is known as the matriarch and serves as the leader. When this parent nears the end of their life or otherwise stops laying eggs, several athamarus in the community choose to undergo certain physical changes, including an increase in size, to announce their intention to become the next matriarch. The decision to be considered a matriarch isn't taken lightly, as the eventual leadership role is responsible for the community's survival and continuation. Each community selects their next matriarch from these \"hopefuls\" in their own way. Such traditions include democratic elections, trials of knowledge, and contests of physicality involving deep diving or riding untamed wildlife. In Xidao, citystate matriarch candidates must present themselves to the High Matriarch and their council to be judged worthy of completing the transformation.</p><p>Sometimes young adults split off to create new communities, especially if resources become scarce or internal conflict escalates. If a group struggles as they establish a community, their former settlement often agrees to take them back if they agree to respect the extant leadership.</p><p>Other groups have mistreated athamarus in the past, so their communities maintain strong internal bonds. Athamarus consider it less risky to deal with each other first. While the most common activities between them are trade, communities also share information. Warnings about danger flow quickly. Safe opportunities are also shared, such as trustworthy land-dwellers and open markets. Such trust with outsiders, however, is easily lost and hard to regain. Most athamarus would rather flee—sometimes even uprooting an entire community—than risk open hostilities.</p><p>Athamaru names typically consist of three syllables. The first syllable is shared by all members of a generation, and the last two syllables identify an individual. When traveling outside their communities, they introduce themselves by their community name first. Some communities, particularly those in Xidao, break this convention, but those names still maintain a flow and identify athamarus hatched in the same year.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Aussandor, Cayiel, Corlena, Mithae, Onteac, Paquotal</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Due to their community-minded nature, athamarus tend to favor beliefs and philosophies that focus on connection and aiding others. They are also aware that they sometimes require protection from the dangers of the sea, so some athamarus take on the roles of staunch guardians or religious figures who plead for intercession from sympathetic gods. Worship within a single community tends to favor one deity, with multiple temples being rare. In the Inner Sea, athamaru settlements typically revere the nature god Gozreh to strengthen their bonds with their surroundings or Erastil for guidance on forming healthy communities. In Tian Xia, the Duke of Thunder Hei Feng's favor is sought as athamarus navigate fickle seasons and politics, while those athamarus who guard the seas against horrors from the deep pray to the triad war gods Srikalis, Sritaming, and Sribaril for unwavering strength.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p><p>seek out new experiences away from your place of birth, lead your community to a better future</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p><p>betray your community or otherwise knowingly do it harm</p><h2>Athamaru Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet, Swim 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Strength Wisdom Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Intelligence</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Thalassic, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

                "content": "<p><em>These intelligent constructs house actual souls and represent what remains of a dying empire's last attempt at greatness. Automatons combine technological ingenuity with magical power, creating a blended being wholly unique to Golarion.</em></p><hr /><p>The Jistka Imperium was the first major human civilization to emerge after Earthfall, arising around the area that would later become Rahadoum and enduring for seven centuries thanks to great advancements in civics and the sciences. However, Jistka's leaders often favored aggressive uses of technology, and early advances paved the way for arrogance, petty infighting, and corruption. The Jistka Imperium's expansionist tendencies and lack of diplomacy earned the Imperium many enemies over the course of its existence. The most notable of these foes was the empire of Ancient Osirion. Osirion's enmity ultimately sealed the Imperium's fate, as they employed clever and depraved magic that proved more than a match for Jistka's legendary golem army, even when the Jistkans began to cut corners and bind fiends into their golems. In a desperate attempt to fight back against internal corruption and external pressures, a cabal of concerned Jistkans formed the Artificer Conclave to develop new technologies to stave off the Imperium's collapse and return Jistka to its former glory. The most successful of these developments were automatons, which the Conclave believed to be the pinnacle of Jistkan constructs-or at least, the last hope for Jistka's salvation. Conclave creators transplanted the mind, life force, and soul of Jistkan individuals into these constructs, creating magical and technological marvels powered by the life energy of the greatest warriors and scholars the organization could recruit. Unfortunately, despite the Conclave's best efforts, the automatons' arrival happened too late to save the already doomed Imperium. The empire collapsed, leaving automatons to fend for themselves.</p><p>The exceptional and forward-thinking construction of automatons means that a fair number remain today, millennia later, scattered to the winds. However, the passage of time has revealed one of automatons' greatest weaknesses: their mortal psyches. Only the strongest willed have managed to retain their memories, sense of self, and lucidity after all this time. As each automaton remains as unique as any living person on Golarion; a given automaton has their own personality, shaped by countless experiences. Most automatons behave reclusively, preferring to avoid others due to fear of attachment or misunderstanding. Even automatons who are more willing to live in the open understand that their unique nature makes them a prime target for hunters, scholars, or worse. Rare is the automaton that lives without the regular occurrence of distrust or worry.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Have lived for several centuries and through many significant events.</li><li>Be hesitant to trust others until they've earned it.</li><li>Remember little of your life before becoming an automaton.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Mistake you for a mindless construct when they first see you.</li><li>Assume you have secret knowledge about magic and technology.</li><li>Look upon you with awe.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Automatons share a common construction-a blend of magically treated metals and stone. This design allows automatons to withstand the rigors of direct combat and makes them particularly hardy. Their heavy bodies can move just as quickly as other combatants, making automatons intimidating foes. The design of an automaton varies depending on the needs of its role. Most automatons have a basic humanoid shape, though some instead have shapes that closely resemble animals. The majority of automatons have a single eye that glows with a dim, magical light. Each also contains a powerful artifact that both houses its individual soul and uses a combination of life and planar energy for power. These automaton cores are marvels of magical engineering whose method of creation has been lost to time.</p><p>As constructs, automatons typically don't need to breathe, eat, or sleep; however, the body of an automaton needs to vent an imperceivable magical exhaust at a constant rate. This venting process requires breathable air to prevent a buildup of exhaust that can clog the automaton's systems, sometimes to fatal effect. Thus, automatons can still suffocate much like living creatures. Though they don't sleep, automatons require a period of magical recalibration and restoration which stabilizes the energies within their core. Without this process, an automaton core is incapable of fully powering the automaton and they enter an inefficient state (similar to a humanoid who doesn't get 8 hours of sleep).</p><p>Automatons don't age and the design of their cores grants them a seemingly endless power source. Many automatons that exist today are thousands of years old, their bodies as efficient as the day of their creation, even if their minds might have deteriorated with the strain of the ages. Automatons lost over time typically met violent ends. An automaton's body is just as vulnerable to destruction as any other construct, though destroying an automaton core is more difficult. As such, an automaton's soul might remain trapped within its core for years after the destruction of its body. This was the intent of the original creators, who hoped to provide functional immortality. However, in reality, the destruction of the body more often leads to a malfunction, requiring magical intervention such as resurrection magic to restore the automaton completely. In the case of the core's destruction, or if it malfunctions catastrophically enough that it can no longer hold the soul, the core releases the spirit to the River of Souls.</p><p>In some cases, an automaton can learn how to consciously or subconsciously influence its core. These automatons eventually learn how to release their souls from their cores, allowing their souls to move on when they feel they have achieved a satisfying life. This act leaves the automaton as a mindless construct, typically still active but no longer capable of anything but aimless wandering and occasional acts of self-defense.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Due to the disparate fates of automatons, many of them lead solitary lives. There are a few cases of automatons originally designed to work together, such as groups of warriors, who remain as a team and dwell together in hideouts or travel together as wanderers. These groups are few and far between, however, and automaton settlements are even rarer. The only pockets of automatons that begin to resemble settlements typically hide among the ruins of Jistka. These groups can hold dozens of automatons, but any attempts to contact or visit them tend to be fruitless. Such gatherings are especially secretive, and the resident automatons will protect their homes at any cost.</p><p>Automatons are far more likely to encounter other ancestries. Depending on the automaton's personality, this encounter could go a number of ways, ranging from extreme secrecy to open visitation. An automaton's unique appearance makes them stand out regardless of where they're found, but most others look upon them with awe or curiosity rather than fear. Magical constructs aren't an alien concept across Golarion, but many of them are mindless. After making it past the initial shock of a thinking construct, it's often not difficult for most grasp how to engage with an automaton. However, automatons are more likely to find the semblance of an everyday life in large cities like Absalom, Azir, or Quantium. Regardless of where they go, an automaton must remain on the lookout for those who would attempt to take their body for study or to access their core.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>The people of the Jistka Imperium saw the aeons of Axis as ideal beings whose behavior was worthy of emulation, so many Jistkans were lawful neutral. Since many automatons contain Jistkan souls, most automatons are lawful neutral, or at least lawful in some capacity. Over the centuries, however, a fair number of automatons have drifted toward neutral alignments as their outlooks change without a primary society or set of ideals upon which to cling. Automatons tend to worship gods of technology or magic like Brigh and Nethys, or various monitor demigods. Worship of Irori and Pharasma are somewhat common among automatons as well. Pharasmin automatons likely learn how to release their souls from their cores, and often choose to do so. Though they are ancient beings from long before the time of Casandalee, a small number of automatons have recognized the new artificial goddess as a kindred spirit.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>An automaton typically keeps the name they had before their transformation into a construct, if they can remember it. Even when other memories fade, memory of their name often remains. As such, many automatons have names with Jistkan origins. Second most common are automatons who had to give themselves a new name, as they lost their memories of the old one at some point. Those automatons that particularly believed in the cause of the Artificer Conclave might instead take the name of one of the conclave's members in honor of the cause that they gave their body to support. Some automatons prefer to change their names over their lifetimes, either selecting a new name from a culture they encountered or adding a title to represent a significant moment in their lives. In some cases an automaton will use a particularly cherished title in place of any other name.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Alnhaman, Busmin, The Doleful, Enoh, Himar, Kantral, The Kindred, Numinar, Scholar, Tehkis, Wayfarer, Yulmian</p><h2>Automaton Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium or Small</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Strength, Free</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Utopian</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive). Choose from Chthonian, Diabolic, Dwarven, Elven, Empyreal, Petran, Pyric, Sussuran, Thalassic, and any other languages to which you have access (such as the languages prevalent in your region). At the GM's discretion, if you still have memories from your time in Jistka, you might speak Jistka instead of Common.</p><p><strong>Senses</strong> Low-Light Vision</p><p><strong>Automaton Core</strong> Your body contains an automaton core infused with planar quintessence that grants you power to perform various tasks and houses your soul and life energy. This life energy flows through you much like the blood of humanoids. As a result, you are a living creature. You don't have the typical construct immunities, can be affected by effects that target a living creature, and can recover Hit Points normally via vitality energy. Additionally, you are not destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. Instead, your life energy attempts to keep you active even in dire straits; you are knocked out and begin dying when reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p><p><strong>Constructed Body</strong> Your physiological needs are different than those of living creatures. You don't need to eat or drink. You don't need to sleep, but you still need a daily period of rest. During this period of rest, you must enter a recuperating standby state for 2 hours, which is similar to sleeping except you are aware of your surroundings and don't take penalties for being unconscious. Much like with sleeping, if you go too long without entering your standby state, you become fatigued and can't recover until you enter standby for 2 hours.</p><h2>Automaton Heritages</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Hunter Automaton]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Mage Automaton]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Sharpshooter Automaton]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Warrior Automaton]</p>",

                "content": "<p>You once enjoyed the simple and boundless pleasures of nature with an innocent, uncluttered mind. You lived from moment to moment, never questioning what comes next or pondering the ramifications of what happened before. You were at one with the wild. Then came the event that changed everything. You drank from a glowing lake, someone pulled a magical prank, a druid sought to elevate your mind. You were pulled out of the present moment of the wild and into a land of thought. For the first time, you realized you had a past.</p><p>For the first time, you started to think about your future. Now you experience the world in a whole new way. You become aware of dangers that never occurred to you before, but there are pleasures and wonders aplenty in this new world, too. That's a good thing, because there's no going back to how things were.</p><p>Awakened animals were normal animals that underwent an experience that awakened their minds, giving them full intelligence and the ability to perceive the world through a lens of thought. There are many mysterious ways for animals to awaken, but the most well-known path is through the ritual <em>awaken animal</em>.</p><p>Every animal takes the process of awakening differently. For some, the opening of their mind is electric, allowing them to perceive and ponder the world like never before. Others are overwhelmed by emotions and thoughts that they didn't ask for and weren't ready to hold. Most people who would awaken an animal assume that the animal they awaken will be full of wonder and gratitude and aren't prepared for the wide variety of responses they receive: shock, sadness, euphoria, curiosity, and anger are common (but not the only ones).</p><p>No matter how an awakened animal reacts, they still must find their way in the world. Some awakened animals try to go back to their lives but almost always find themselves disconnected from their unawakened peers. Others embrace the civilized world entirely, doing their best to navigate a world built for humanoids. Over time, awakened animals find themselves moving between both the civilized world and the wild, for each holds only a part of what they need from life.</p><p>If you want to play a character who is extremely outside the norm and crosses between the civilized and natural worlds, you should play an awakened animal.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><p>Negotiate between humanoid societies and creatures of the wilderness.</p><ul><li>Oscillate between rumination and acting with wild aggression.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Think you are a beast who is easily provoked.</li><li>Want to study you as an oddity without respect for your agency or comfort.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Awakened animals are very similar in appearance to the animals they once were. From a glance, it is difficult for humanoids to tell an awakened animal apart from others of its species. On closer inspection, most humanoids notice something different about the eyes and movements of an awakened animal. The awakened animal carries themself in a way that is self-aware, and even those who don't know that the animal is awakened feel that difference. Often awakened animals take on the practice of wearing clothing and other adornments, and using tools, which truly make their awakened nature obvious.</p><p>Animals recognize awakened animals instantly and react with trepidation at first. If welcomed, eventually the animal will settle and approach the awakened animal. It takes a long time for an animal to be truly comfortable around its awakened brethren, but over time it can happen.</p><p>Traumatic awakenings sometimes create stunning visual differences in an awakened animal. There are tales of awakened bears with flame-red fur and birds with ghostly feathers.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Awakened animals are rare enough and separate enough that few find themselves traveling together, let alone making their own societies. Awakened animals often settle into the societies that are close by, integrating in disguise as a \"typical\" animal or overtly as craftspeople and laborers. While an awakened animal may decide that humanoid society is not for them, those that stay do not find much trouble in adapting. Most places in Golarion have seen enough that people get over their initial shock at seeing a talking house cat or songbird quickly.</p><p>Awakened animals who have turned their back on \"civilized\" life tend to create animal societies that they are the natural rulers and leaders of. They use their intelligence to create order and structure that animals of their type wouldn't otherwise be able to do. There are tales in Ustalav of large wolf packs made of several combined packs led by an awakened wolf. The pack roams the countryside, protecting villages from incursions of undead. In Isger, merchants tell tales of bears who attack caravans, but do only enough damage to steal the goods before leaving.</p><p>There are also rumors of a city full of awakened animals in Iobaria named Roam. Most awakened animals hear about it at some point in their lives. Some think of it as a fanciful dream, but many do attempt to find it. Roam is said to be the true home of all awakened animals, a place where their intellect and wild spirits are equally welcome.</p><p>Animals use their senses to identify others instead of names, so their relationship with naming tends to reflect that. They might give friends nicknames that correspond to vivid feelings and sensory information. They often do this for themselves as well, only straying from these conventions if they are using a name they were given as a pet or companion or if they are trying to follow the conventions of the society around them. Sometimes they blend their instinctual approach with a more conventional name to create something bombastic and proud.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Redfur, Snarling Eye, King Halfhorn, Blacknose, Jewelmouth, Queen Scale, Yellowbeak, Bigclaw, Grinning Maw, Scowl</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Awakened animals tend to see the world through a lens of natural order. Those who are unsettled by humans or have been traumatized by them typically live within nature, while those driven by curiosity or structure seek to find a place in the more ordered and rule-bound nature of humanoid society.</p><p>There is no uniform religion among awakened animals, but it is unsurprising that gods with domains in the natural world, like Gozreh, are popular. There are small groups of awakened animals who worship destructive gods such as Lamashtu and Rovagug. Those who were awakened by a companion might adopt that companion's outlook, and possibly adopt that companion's religion as well.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> explore your newfound sentience, enjoy the creature comforts of humanoid civilization; often other edicts related to your animal side, such as \"keep the pack together\" for a canine or \"always wash your food\" for a raccoon</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> revert to purely animalistic behaviors</p><h2>Awakened Animal Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> Your ancestry Hit Points depend on the size you choose (see below): 6 HP if you're Tiny or Small, 8 HP if you're Medium, or 10 HP if you're Large.</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Choose the size appropriate to your animal: Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large SPEED Determined by your heritage</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Wisdom, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Intelligence</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

You can wear, hold, wield, and use items. Which limbs you use to manipulate items and how many are determined by you and your GM, but for the rules you function like a humanoid with two hands.</p><p><strong>Awakened Mind</strong> Awakening altered your mind. You are no longer an animal, but you can still ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with animals of your kind. By remembering your instincts, you can allow yourself to be affected by spells and other effects as though you were an animal.</p><h2>Awakened Animal Heritages</h2><p>Animals come in a wide variety of body shapes with their own capabilities. Choose one of the following awakened animal heritages at 1st level. If you are an awakened animal with a versatile heritage, you still select one awakened animal heritage to inform your character's story and cosmetic form, but you do not gain any of its mechanical effects, though you have a land Speed of 20 feet unless you choose to be aquatic, in which case you have a swim Speed of 20 feet.

                "content": "<p>Azarketis, inheritors of a shattered empire's legacy, hold their proud traditions close but still surface to interact with the rest of the world.</p><p>The aquatic humanoids of the Inner Sea share a somber and burdened history. Most refer to these aquatic peoples as gillmen or sometimes Low Azlanti, though they typically refer to themselves as azarketi, an Azlanti word that translates roughly to “people of the seas.” After Earthfall, these proud humans were mutated into aquatic servants by their alghollthu foes. Feeling like they don't fully belong with their human brethren nor with the sea that binds them, many azarketis struggle for a sense of identity and purpose. Though they remain distrusted by the surface dwellers, azarketis celebrate their unique lineage and their descent from the venerated Azlanti culture.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Ambitiously seek to defy negative perceptions and prejudice laid against you.</li><li>Be reclusive and skeptical of strangers.</li><li>Regard the water as your home, but be intrigued by societies along the shore.</li></ul><h2>Others probably...</h2><ul><li>Assume you are an ambassador to the sea and ask for your advice on nautical matters.</li><li>Misunderstand your gentle gestures and mild expressions.</li><li>Treat you with distrust or suspicion and anticipate betrayal from you.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Azarketis appear as regal, athletic humans. Their soft, hydrophilic skin ranges in tones from pearlescent white to pinkish, greenish, or brown tones reminiscent of coral. Azarketis with hair are somewhat rare; many sport fins or scaled ridges on their heads instead. Like the Azlanti people from which they descend, they often have violet eyes. Their aquatic lineage is obvious thanks to the sets of three gills on either side of their necks, as well as their webbed hands and feet. Azarketis have been known to live longer than humans, although they mature at about the same rate.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Azarketis lack the center for combined culture that helps other groups maintain a cohesive identity. The vastness of the oceans and waterways spread these swift-swimming people across the Inner Sea and beyond. Many azarketis rely only on the small familial groups in their immediate community and prefer smaller populations with comrades they trust and know intimately.</p><p>Some azarketis prefer to foster connections with their surface-dwelling brethren. Living in ports, river towns and along the shore allows azarketis a greater scope of opportunities not afforded to exclusively land or sea peoples. Although integrating with land society can be difficult, azarketis manage by forming bonded communities. Members will often have fond familial names for one another, regardless of actual relation.</p><p>If they have the means, some azarketis dress in attire reflecting their Azlanti heritage. More commonly, azarketis do their best to remain inconspicuous when they emerge from the water. Many will wear shemaghs or other head wrappings, which both hide their gills and provide a few extra comfortable hours out of water if soaked before donning.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>As they are typically outsiders to the domains of surface life, azarketis tend toward deities with an affinity for the ocean or other forms of water, the most popular being Gozreh. They are also likely to give reverence to other deities of nature or navigation, such as Desna.</p><p>Some azarketis are tempted toward the call of the deep and serve their old alghollthu masters as gods. These individuals are enticed by eldritch entities such as the mysterious veiled masters—powerful beings of the deep ocean responsible for both uplifting and destroying the Azlanti people.</p><p>Azarketis vary wildly in beliefs and values, as evidenced by their broad divergence in allegiance; thus, azarketis can be of any alignment.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Azarketis often take the names of nautical, weather, or geographical features important to the azarketi's family. Other azarketi groups will choose human names in order to encourage conformity with surface cultures. Some azarketi names have been passed down through so many generations that they still use ancient Azlanti roots or refer to bodies of water that no longer exist.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Aft, Aliz, Cascade, Delta, Harbor, Ilani, Inkua, Jib, Lagoon, Lobay, Marine, Tidal, Windward, Zarket</p><h2>Azarketi Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet, Swim 30 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Charisma, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Wisdom</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Alghollthu</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

After the first 24 hours outside of water, you take a -1 status penalty to Fortitude saves. After 48 hours, you struggle to breathe air and begin to suffocate until returned to water.</p><h2>Azarketi Heritages</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Ancient Scale Azarketi]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Benthic Azarketi]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Inured Azarketi]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Mistbreath Azarketi]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Murkeyed Azarketi]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.River Azarketi]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Spined Azarketi]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Tactile Azarketi]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Thalassic Azarketi]</p>",

                "content": "<p>Centaurs are proud nomads who range far and wide across their ancestral territories, protecting their lands from exploitation and intrusion. They are survivalists who forge tight bonds with family and community and stand firm in the face of danger. Many are skilled hunters, trackers, and warriors who do battle with bow, steel, and hooves. Brave and stubborn, they're willing to challenge even the fiercest foes and largest forces to protect their homes, kin, and the land within their domain.</p><p>As hunter-gatherers, centaurs rely upon the bounty of the natural world for sustenance. As youths, they're taught to nurture and respect their surrounding ecosystems so the land remains healthy and bountiful throughout their lives and is preserved for future generations. Centaurs understand that a land exploited or despoiled is a land unfit for survival, just as a herd overhunted dies off. In the ancient past, such carelessness and greed resulted in malnutrition, famine, and loss of territory, and most centaurs are careful not to repeat the mistakes of their distant forbears. Thus, centaurs prefer to adapt to their surroundings, rather than abuse their environments for their own comfort. They're guardians of nature, and their beliefs lead them to clash with careless urbanites and expansionists over exploitative and dangerous practices, including overhunting, overlogging, pollution, and city development.</p><p>Centaurs are happiest when mobile, and many feel restless or fall ill if cooped up or sedentary for too long. They're fond of racing and athletics, and are aggressively competitive, always striving to best their previous achievements and to outdo their fellows. This often results in centaurs being judged as contentious and boorish by outsiders. Most centaurs enjoy physical contests, particularly team sports, and award small but valued tokens to victors—though for many centaurs, bragging rights are the greatest prize of all. Not all centaurs compete as athletes, but most centaurs enjoy exertion and take naturally to activities that get their blood pumping and their heart racing.</p><p>If you want to play a character who runs free and proud, always looking out for their companions, you should play a centaur.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Go to great lengths to protect your home and the people you love.</li><li>Enjoy competition, particularly organized sports and tests of strength or endurance.</li><li>Respect and value the natural world.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Assume you're an expert archer or fierce warrior.</li><li>Think you understand horses.</li><li>Consider you aggressive and overly competitive.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Centaurs have the form of muscular humans with the bodies of horses from the waist down. They're hardy and stable, capable of carrying heavy burdens and cumbersome loads for long periods. Centaurs display great variation in their size, hair, and coloration, with most averaging 7 feet tall and weighing over 2,000 pounds. While coloration is often inherited, a centaur's coat markings are unpredictable, and many take pride in the distinct patterns, placements, and chromatic shifts of their coats. These markings are present at birth and don't change over the course of a centaur's life. In ages past, a centaur's markings were used to divine their future. Though this tradition has fallen out of favor since the death of prophecy, some particularly rare markings are still considered lucky or an ill omen today.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Centaurs are originally from the continent of Casmaron, and most still reside there today, particularly in Iblydos and Iobaria. In Iblydos, many centaurs are agrarian, carefully and sustainably tending farmland and gardens, particularly for wildflowers, olives, figs, and grapes, from which they vinify a beloved (and potent) local wine. Thanks to popular folktales regarding the near-mythical centaurs Elthavus and Ventriadi, famed mentors to numerous ancient Iblydan hero-gods of old, it is traditionally believed that centaurs excel at training heroes. Centaurs have done nothing to dissuade this notion. Most centaurs enjoy the act of mentorship, and aging military leaders, healers, astronomers, engineers, and other experts are often thrilled to pass their knowledge down to younger generations. Thanks to their competitive nature, some centaur teachers compete with one another over who can train the most promising students, soldiers, and intellectuals.</p><p>Over the ages, centaurs spread throughout much of the Inner Sea via Iobaria, most notably the Isle of Kortos, where grudges against the citizens of Absalom are long-enduring. There, centaurs wage guerrilla warfare against the constant intruders into their territory and clash with nearby harpies and minotaurs. They range across the lowlands and forests, in alpine meadows, and throughout the Immenwood.</p><p>Centaurs maintain large territories that they range through in a nomadic lifestyle, living as mobile communities of hunter-gatherers. These areas are well defined and have been maintained through generations. At the heart of each territory is a centralized location of import. Often a religious site, meeting place, or camp is maintained for sick and the elderly centaurs who can no longer travel with the rest of their band. Occasionally, this camp is a permanent settlement, constructed of wood, limestone, clay bricks, or marble, depending on the region and environment, and surrounded by fields of carefully tended crops or flocks of chickens, goats, or sheep. Centaurs have a passing fondness for animals, but rarely keep domesticated pets and find horses off-putting.</p><p>A centaur band is a tight-knit community, led by a respected member of the group who's proven capable, wise, and calm under pressure. Usually, these leaders are middle-aged and older, as centaurs consider life experience a necessary quality in a leader. Rarely, a centaur or band chooses to become sedentary or integrate with a larger nation. These are often small bands whose territories have been destroyed or stolen, emissaries representing their bands, adventurers, loners, outcasts, or even bands who simply can't survive against a superior military enemy. Regardless, this choice is not made lightly, as most centaurs feel constrained in urban environments, particularly in settlements built for people smaller than them.</p><p>When built, centaur constructions are large and airy to allow for range of movement. Their buildings are communal, always aboveground, and open to the elements in places—wide doors held open, or roof and wall hatches to allow in light. Most are built of wood, thatch, and mudbrick while in Iblydos, harder materials like marble and stone are more likely. In Iobaria, they often repurpose old cyclopean ruins, which offer plentiful space.</p><p>In Iobaria, herbalism, medicine, and magical purification are more commonly valued skills, thanks to the incessant plagues and illnesses that are prevalent in the region. A centaur band dare not travel without a few skilled healers, and even hunting parties and scouts rarely split off for long. Centaur healers and herbalists frequently put aside their differences and affiliations to exchange knowledge at annual meetings known as Soothings. There, band representatives from across the nation exchange medical breakthroughs and other knowledge. The largest of these Soothings occurs biannually in Vurnirn, the largest centaur settlement in Iobaria.</p><p>In Kaer Maga, Cheliax, Molthune, and Oprak, centaurs have assimilated with the larger nations, sometimes living as citizens and merchants, but more often serving as soldiers and mercenaries. In Garund, centaurs range across plains and savannas. They get along well with other nature-conscious cultures, teaming up with catfolk, tripkees, elves, and orcs to battle demons near Lake Ocota, undead near the borders of Geb and Mzali, and other dangerous threats. Centaurs remain open foes with Taldor and Andoran, remembering well the old wars with the expansionist Taldan empire that drove them into the Verduran Forest. Many in these regions dream of retaking their ancestral territories back from Taldan and Andoran control—a dangerous pipe dream certain to result in the deaths of countless centaurs.</p><p>Centaurs believe in reform and often rely on community pressure to discourage harmful behaviors. The unrepentant and the greatest transgressors face exile beyond the band's borders; centaurs avoid ending the lives of their own, except during times of war and mid-battle. While some centaur bands, serving demons and other foul gods, may attack other centaurs, even they prefer to harry other foes.</p><p>Centaurs consider saddles and bridles both restricting and shamefully insulting, akin to being shackled and caged. They despise being ridden and refuse to serve as a mount except in the direst of circumstances or emergencies, or only by their most trusted companions.</p><p>Centaurs have a single name and sometimes earn an appellation through their deeds, appearance, or personality traits, such as Thunderhoof or Windrunner. When beyond their territorial borders, centaurs use their band's name as an additional identifier. Centaurs who settle in other nations either adopt their band name as a last name or create a unique last name of their own, founding a lineage that's passed down to future generations.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Aecora, Demeleon, Ertris, Hycanthe, Irdan, Jalvayne, Karala, Malion, Oridius, Tolron, Vorag</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>The beliefs of a centaur often depend on where and how they were raised. Many centaurs follow the Green Faith or worship deities who share their respect for nature, such as Cernunnos, Erastil, or Gozreh. Others feel kinship with Desna, goddess of travel. Healers and herbalists favor Immonhiel or Pharasma. In urban areas, Kurgess and Gorum are favorites, depending on the centaur's temperament and profession.</p><p>Centaurs have two primary religious figures: Greenspeakers and Faithspeakers. Greenspeakers are one with nature, followers of the Green Faith, exceptional herbalists, and otherwise learned in the ways of the natural world. Faithspeakers are pious devotees of gods, demons, celestials, and other beings. Both are given equal respect, considered two sides of the same coin. Through their Speakers, centaurs interact with the world beyond what they can see and feel, and lead ceremonies, celebrations, and prayers. Celebrations are usually divided into two categories: beginnings and endings, with beginnings such as weddings, births, and spring celebrated at dawn, and endings such as harvests, funerals, and partings celebrated at dusk. Death rites vary by region and culture, but sedentary bands and those who cultivate fields, gardens, or crops, often burn their dead on pyres, releasing their spirits from their material bodies, then using the resulting ashes to fertilize fields or gardens so the dead can continue to serve their community. In regions with rocky ground or frigid climate, centaurs instead bury their dead under cairns and stone mounds.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p><p>ensure knowledge is passed on, live in harmony with the natural world, play fair in an honest competition</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p><p>fail to roam, aid in the wanton destruction of a natural landscape</p><h2>Centaur Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Large</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 30 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Strength, Wisdom, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Fey, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Both an integral part of the underlying processes of the universe and strangely set apart, conrasus look to aeons to understand their existence.</em></p><hr /><p>Conrasus aren't entirely clear on their own origins. Some historians think them a failed experiment of a wizardly cabal—possibly a splinter of artificers from the ancient Jitska Imperium—who desperately hoped to bind a pleroma to bolster their army but who accidentally conjured shattered scraps of the aeon instead. Others believe conrasus were built by their ancestors using an accelerated, iterative evolution process as natural as one designed by those who build portions of their own bodies could ever hope to achieve. Most likely, it is a mix of the two.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Do your best to determine and act upon the will of your guiding aeon.</li><li>Use rituals and repetitive actions as a means to meditate and reflect on your purpose.</li><li>Have difficulty applying your cosmic instincts and senses to a physical existence.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>View you as part of a hivemind at best or lacking in free will at worst.</li><li>Have trouble understanding your perspective or attempts at communication.</li><li>Look to you as the expert on any matters involving aeons or related beings.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>The true form of a conrasu is an abstract chunk of spiritual essence. While their being exists beyond the truth of humanoid senses, to the mortal eye, their body usually resembles a globe of light, darkness, or space. Floating, internal pinpricks of illumination sit inside the ball, slightly obscured as if peeking through a gelatinous substance. These “cores” surround themselves with bodies made out of still-living wood, creating the form that most people recognize as a conrasu.</p><p>Conrasus themselves are called to a path and, once they find it, shape frames to create a suitable form, leading to a wide variety of appearances. As a conrasu ages, the supple green wood of ttheir body hardens, causing their limbs to lose mobility. Conrasus must constantly grow new arms and roots for their living exoskeleton, leaving their frozen limbs as immobile effigies along their shell.</p><p>Conrasus can't maintain their integrity without their wooden exoskeletons. A conrasu that loses its exoskeleton dissipates and dies, though they can be returned to life with magic like other beings.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>There are three distinct types of conrasus. Maintainers tend and care for others, believing they must cultivate a proper balance between various forces. Shapers build and direct those around them, and feel that balance is maintained by those who strive to preserve the world's equilibrium. Lastly, correctors fix problems of all sorts, often acting as stalwart bastions of law who perceive the world in absolutes, with few to no shades of gray. True balance can be achieved only in cases where pressure and force have been applied to make necessary changes.</p><p>On rare occasions, a conrasu may hear and heed the call of another form of extraplanar being. One might serve a psychopomp, another an archon, and yet another might become a witch and adopt an unknown figure as a patron.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Many conrasus consider themselves bound to a specific aeon, following them like a deity and doing what they believe to be the aeon's bidding. As a result, almost all conrasus are lawful neutral in alignment.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Conrasus have little in the way of consciousness as others understand it before they self-actualize and leave the nursery-towns where they sprouted. That includes a name, a concept of gender, and even the passage of time beyond their little bubbles-these are picked up in the wider world. As a result, a conrasu might have nearly any appellation.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Automa, Azubu, Dumi, Emeka, Ganizadi, Locu, Incanes, Radi, Shell, Weave</p><h2>Conrasu Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Wisdom, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Mwangi, Rasu</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this healing increases by 1d8. Once a conrasu has recovered Hit Points in this way, they are temporarily immune to further uses of Sunlight Healing for 1 day.</p><h2>Conrasu Heritages</h2><p>As a conrasu grows, they take part in a rite that changes and enhances their form. Each rite has different benefits, which manifest as specific heritages.

They have wide, compact bodies and burly frames.

A long beard is a sign of maturity and honor among many dwarf clans.</p><p>Dwarves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 25, though their traditionalist culture places more value on completing coming-of-age ceremonies unique to each clan than reaching a certain age.

After leaving Golarion in ancient times, they returned to a changed land, and they still struggle to reclaim their ancestral homes. Elves value kindness, intellect, and beauty, with many elves striving to improve their manners, appearance, and culture. Their studies delve into a level of detail that most shorter-lived peoples find excessive or inefficient. Elves are often rather private people, steeped in the secrets of their groves and kinship groups. They're slow to build friendships outside their kinsfolk, as elves who spend their lives among shorterlived peoples often become morose after watching generations of companions age and die. These elves are known as Forlorn among their fellow elves.</p><p>If you want a character who is magical, mystical, and mysterious, you should play an elf.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Carefully curate your relationships with people with shorter lifespans.</li><li>Adopt specialized or obscure interests simply for the sake of mastering them.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Focus on your appearance, either admiring your grace or treating you as if you're physically fragile.</li><li>Worry that you privately look down on them, or feel like you're condescending and aloof.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>While generally taller than humans, elves possess a fragile grace, accentuated by long features and sharply pointed ears. Their eyes are wide and rounded, featuring large and often vibrantly colored pupils that make up the entire visible portion of the eye. These pupils give them an alien look and allow them to see sharply even in very little light.</p><p>Elves gradually adapt to their environment and their companions, and they often take on physical traits reflecting their surroundings. An elf who has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries, for example, might exhibit verdant hair and gnarled fingers, while one who's lived in a desert might have golden pupils and skin. Elves reach physical adulthood around the age of 20, though they aren't considered to be fully emotionally mature by other elves until closer to the passing of their first century. A typical elf can live to around 600 years old.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The inborn patience and intellectual curiosity of elves make them excellent sages, philosophers, and wizards, and their societies are built upon their inherent sense of wonder and knowledge.</p><p>Elves hold deeply seated ideals of individualism, allowing each elf to explore multiple occupations before alighting on a particular pursuit or passion that suits her best. Elves bear notorious grudges against rivals, which elves call ‘ilduliel,' but these antagonistic relationships can sometimes blossom into friendships over time. An elf keeps their personal name secret among their family, while giving a nickname when meeting other people. This nickname can change over time, due to events in the elf's life or even on a whim. A single elf might be known by many names by associates of different ages and regions. Elven names consist of multiple syllables and are meant to flow lyrically—at least in the Elven tongue.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Aerel, Amrunelara, Caladrel, Dardlara, Faunra, Heldalel, Jathal, Lanliss, Oparal, Seldlon, Soumral, Talathel, Tessara, Variel, Yalandlara, Zordlon</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Elves are often emotional and capricious, yet they hold high ideals close to their hearts. They prefer deities who share their love of all things mystic and artistic. Desna and Shelyn are particular favorites, the former for her sense of wonder and the latter for her appreciation of artistry. Calistria is the most notorious of elven deities, as she represents many of the elven ideals taken to the extreme.</p><h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4><p>find beauty in nature and art, explore things others would keep hidden, demonstrate superiority to your rival</p><h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4><p>abandon your own path, force another creature to do something</p><h2>Elf Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 30 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Constitution</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Elven</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

                "content": "<p><em>Once human and now something apart, fetchlings display the Shadow Plane's ancient influence through monochrome complexions, glowing eyes, and the casting of supernatural shadows.</em></p><hr /><p>Fetchlings are a striking people whose skin appears entirely drained of color. These lithe and shadowy beings seem to sink and vanish into the gloom. They see in darkness, exercise control over shadows, and have strange occult powers. Some fetchlings develop their powers enough to pass between the Shadow and Material Planes, leaving other ancestries to whisper about figures that emerge from shaded corners and then vanish without a trace. Through magic and other means, they've spread across Golarion and the planes beyond, as adaptable as the humans they once were.</p><p>The first fetchlings were refugees. Ages ago, when Earthfall destroyed ancient Azlant and cast the world into darkness, one small group of Azlanti pleaded for rescue. A mysterious hooded figure known as the Widow answered their call, slicing open a passage into the Shadow Plane. The Azlanti stepped through, trading the darkness of Earthfall for a deep shadow. As they navigated the plane's strange environs and dangerous inhabitants, its nature slowly worked monumental changes on the survivors.</p><p>If you want a character more at home in a mirror world of shadow, infused with umbral gloom, and who embodies the dualities of light and darkness, you should play a fetchling.</p><h2>You Might…</h2><ul><li>Live and work in gloomy areas of dim light with plenty of shadows, only providing bright light when expecting visitors.</li><li>Look to people's shadows as a way of identifying them, alongside features like stature or facial structure.</li><li>Maintain composure when faced with strange creatures and circumstances.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably…</h2><ul><li>Believe you have shadowy powers, such as the ability to consume light as food, melt into darkness, or travel between planes.</li><li>Expect you to be cautious, reserved, and a loner.</li><li>Express interest in your ancestral physiological connection to the Shadow Plane.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Most of the Shadow Plane appears as an altered version of the Material Plane but leeched of color. These same forces in the Shadow Plane have touched fetchlings, whose skin tones fall on a monochromatic scale from stark white to deep black, and all the shades of gray between. Their bodies are just as diverse in shape and size as humans, though most display a certain fluidity of motion reminiscent of shifting shadows. Fetchlings' reflective, pupilless eyes can pierce darkness. A fetchling's most notable feature is their shadow, which almost never faithfully reflects their body. Instead, fetchling shadows might have incongruous shapes or sizes, while others flicker, move of their own accord, or imitate the shadow of another nearby creature.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Most fetchlings remain close to Golarion on either the Material or Shadow Planes, either forming majority-fetchling communities or forging solitary paths. Both planar groups tend to be insular; many fetchling cultures preserve memories of their early, perilous days confronting the Shadow Plane's hostile or beguiling denizens. Their predilection for forming tight communal bonds and adapting to local customs has spread to become part of broader fetchling culture, reinforced by two major fetchling groups—the Estlaris and Sharedars—who live in the shadow of more powerful entities.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>A culture of survival passed down through generations means many fetchlings prefer to maintain a cautious worldview and adapt to prevailing circumstances. As a result, many trend toward a neutral outlook on life. Some choose to join with local powers for personal or communal advancement, or to tear systems down from the inside. Others attempt to shatter what they see as fetters that bind them and their communities.</p><p>No small number of fetchlings are nonreligious, recognizing all gods' powers but revering none. Faithful fetchlings prefer gods that offer protection and stability, be it the pastoral embrace of Erastil or the binding chains of Zon-Kuthon. Those who travel alone or pass between planes seek the comfort of Alseta, Desna, and Gozreh. Calistria appeals to ambitious fetchlings, while Grandmother Spider and Sivanah help those who wish to move through the world unnoticed or unfettered. Some worship these three as a pantheon called the Laughing Veil; a few even include Norgorber as a fourth member.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Fetchlings adapted to a new world, and their names do the same. These names commonly include phonetic qualities from multiple languages or are simply local cultural names that fetchling families find compelling. Other dominant naming conventions include flowing sounds, harsh or hissing consonants, and surnames that refer to important relatives or community traits.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Amelisce, Ashka, Drosil, Eitsanara, Eomva, Ikyamek, Inva, Jegan, Lirtae, Meotrai, Sorsul, Zokaratz</p><h2>Fetchling Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Free</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Shadowtongue</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

                "content": "<p><em>Fleshwarps are people whose forms were created or radically transformed by magic, alchemy, or unnatural energies. Their unorthodox appearance can make it difficult for them to find a place for themselves in the world.</em></p><hr /><p>Magic and science that can warp bone and twist sinew are all too common on Golarion. Fleshwarps are those who have been permanently altered by such methods—sometimes a sapient being created whole cloth from inanimate flesh, but often a victim unwillingly transformed by strange energies or sadistic creators.</p><p>The ancestry name \"fleshwarp\" is an umbrella term, since on Golarion the actual fleshwarping process is more infamously well-known than are alterations caused by uncontrolled magic, technology, or fringe science. Whether practiced by Thassilonian wizards, Nexian fleshcrafters, or the drow of the Darklands, fleshwarping is the craft of reshaping flesh and mind in vats of foul magical reagents. This has led some scholars of monsters to argue that only those beings created by traditional fleshwarping should be considered fleshwarps. Regardless of the source of their altered forms, fleshwarps bear their new shape forever, transformed beings living a wild and strange existence beyond what was possible for their original ancestry.</p><p>Although fleshwarps are humanoid, no two look the same. One might possess limbs in unusual places and skin as smooth as glass, while another might have a thick matting of spiny fur. Some might have animalistic features, like a boar snout, scales, or cloven hooves. Others have entirely alien appearances, such as bulging eyes on the backs of their hands. Some may have only subtly uncanny features that differentiate them, such as glowing teeth, smoking eyes, or fingernails made of bone. The only commonality among fleshwarps is their mismatched nature. Let your imagination run wild when creating a fleshwarp character!</p><p>If you want a character who is tough and hardy, can change their form as they grow, and can use their wholly unique appearance to inspire awe or fear in others, you should play a fleshwarp.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Embrace your unusual appearance to inspire respect or fear.</li><li>Be used to relying on yourself.</li><li>Distrust large groups of people, particularly mobs, based on past experiences.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Find your physiology fascinating or terrifying.</li><li>Assume you are an expert on strange creatures or occult phenomena.</li><li>Consider you an enigmatic and unpredictable—and perhaps even dangerous—outsider.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Fleshwarps are humanoids, ranging from 5 to 7 feet tall and from just under 100 pounds to more than 300 pounds. The proportion and appearance of their limbs and features differ widely, but fleshwarps functionally have two legs, two arms, and a single head; a fleshwarp with more limbs than this should consider an appropriate ancestry feat to reflect this variance, or one of their limbs might be vestigial and mostly nonfunctional. Fleshwarps differ widely in their appearance due to the unique circumstances of their creation. Even fleshwarp siblings or two people transformed through the same procedure might look wildly different.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Fleshwarps are so few in number that congregations of them are rare. They most often live on their own, with a small family group, or at the outskirts of a community. Some thrive in cities, however, where they can remain anonymous among the crowds while pursuing careers that allow them to avoid contact with people who might fear or persecute them.</p><p>Fleshwarps value endurance and are quick to learn from others, so those who come into contact with others of their kind usually share stories that help each other survive, hide, or thrive more effectively. How a fleshwarp formed can be a painful or horrifying subject, one they consider rude to discuss with anyone besides close friends or loved ones.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Fleshwarps have little to gain from the broader society, and therefore rarely work to support society in turn, beyond perhaps helping other fleshwarps. They need to be able to adapt quickly to survive on their own. As a consequence, few fleshwarps are lawful. Although bigoted or short-sighted people view fleshwarps as monsters, fleshwarps are no more or less prone to evil than any other people, and most seek only to live their lives without trouble. Most are neutral in alignment, for while alienation doesn't force a fleshwarp to feel contempt for others, neither does it encourage a fleshwarp to avoid it. This is especially true for fleshwarps living in the societies that gave birth to their traumatic transformation. Fleshwarps aren't often casually religious; most either have little to do with faith at all (viewing themselves as scorned by the gods or simply seeing faith as impractical for survival) or are exceptionally devout. Religious fleshwarps often revere Arazni, Calistria, Desna, or Gozreh; evil fleshwarps typically turn to Lamashtu, finding consolation in the Mother of Monsters.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Fleshwarps can come from-and thus have names from-any culture or ancestry, but some give themselves new names after being transformed, whether to celebrate the change, recognize a new phase of their lives, or conceal their past identity. Many fleshwarps also carry a descriptive nickname granted to them by others, such as \"Triple Handed,\" \"Barkfoot,\" or \"Many-Mouth.\"</p><p>Fleshwarps don't keep nicknames they find personally offensive, but they tend to keep ones that describe their distinctive appearances or that are given by people they care about.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Borble, Dag, Feff, Hurn, Kemp, Omber, Ostro, Shurni, Surm, Wumpin</p><h2>Fleshwarp Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium or Small</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Free</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

                "content": "<p>These intelligent plant people, created by a long-dead druid, possess a sort of immortality through their seeds—unless these are destroyed by external events other than merely the ravages of time.</p><p>During the height of the wars between Geb and Nex long ago, the archmage Nex asked the renegade druid Ghorus to create a plant that would feed his people even in the most inhospitable land. Ghorus did so, developing a flower that would adapt to every environment and withstand every sort of magecraft and spellworking. He succeeded too well. In the strange soil of the Impossible Lands, the flower grew and soon began to think—and then to walk and speak. These were the first ghorans. Despite their new awareness, ghorans found that many other peoples were adept at ignoring inconvenient truths, especially those involving where their next meal might come from. Bit by bit, seed by seed, ghorans grew themselves into humanoid forms, hoping to engender sympathy by mirroring the appearance of humanoids. It eventually worked, and the ghorans won citizenship and protected status in the nation of Nex. Even so, time and predation has taken its toll; the population of ghorans is small and ever dwindling.</p><p>Each ghoran is essentially an ancient spark of life that inhabits, successively, a series of plantlike bodies. Every twenty years or so, a ghoran produces a seed. Their old body withers away as their soul enters the seed, which then swiftly produces a new body. The process brings with it minor changes in personality and some loss of more distant memories, such that each new ghoran is related to their predecessor while still being a different individual. The art of creating more ghorans died with the druid Ghorus, so they're a tiny but stable minority in the Impossible Lands, dwindling bit by bit over the centuries as a few of them fall to violence and mischance.</p><p>If you want a character who's an ancient and alien soul, trying to survive and thrive in a strange and hostile world, you should play a ghoran.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Offhandedly mention events from thousands of years ago.</li><li>Find \"animal\" behaviors strange.</li><li>Constantly make small changes to your body.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Have a hard time recognizing you after not seeing you for a while.</li><li>Are either intimidated or fascinated by how long you've lived and how much you know.</li><li>Have heard you're delicious.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Roughly humanoid in size and shape, a ghoran's body is mostly made up of a fibrous plant material resembling a woody vine, with a face like an enormous, colorful flower. Ghorans have a great deal of control over the shape and structure of their bodies: with a few hours of effort, a ghoran might make themselves taller or shorter, long-limbed or barrel-chested. They have a reputation for tasting deliciously sweet and herbaceous. Most people merely find this quality a curiosity and don't attempt to take a bite, but animals in the wild will sometimes seek them out and attack them. Though they can learn to smile or laugh to fit in with other ancestries, they tend to use a different set of emotional signifiers, fluttering their face-petals to show happiness and making a rustling sound when agitated or upset. Every ghoran has a large cavity within their torso that contains a large seed. When a ghoran's body becomes too decrepit to function, they impart their memories into the seed and plant it into the ground. Within 1 to 2 months, a new ghoran body finishes growing from the seed, and the original ghoran collapses into a pile of inert organic matter. This curious method of propagation leaves a ghoran vulnerable, and many ghorans are defensive about the process among non-ghoran peoples.Being plants, ghorans have no innate understanding of gender in the human sense. Ghorans who find themselves in the company of other ancestries sometimes adopt a more masculine or feminine form, though just as many don't bother.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Ghorans originated in Nex, and most reside as a tiny minority population in that land. In its major cities, they have built little enclaves of their own in neighborhoods featuring sweeping parks and massive trees, with the largest of these enclaves being in Quantium. While they don't possess the magical ability to enter an extradimensional home within a tree like dryads, ghorans live among the trees, typically making their homes within the neighborhoods' big parks. They are extremely skilled at building their abodes so that they don't disrupt the lives of the local flora. Visitors to a ghoran enclave might not realize initially that they've entered a home, assuming instead that they're in a recreational public space. Ghorans don't typically mind the unexpected company so long as the visitors are respectful of the park, of their homes, and of any ghorans they meet. The ghorans who live in major cities are relatively social and accepting of other ancestries, and they tend to be eager to interact, learn about others, and engage in trade. Outside of these cities, ghorans inhabit small, remote communities in the foothills of the Shattered Range and dwell in secluded forests, and they tend to be much more isolationist. Remembering well that Ghorus originally created their ancestry as food for the \"animals,\" they generally have no great desire to get to know other ancestries. However, as each new incarnation slightly shifts a ghoran's personality, they sometimes develop a wanderlust that spurs them to leave an isolated home and travel into the wider world. Often, such ghorans hold bits—or even troves—of ancient lore lost to the outside world for many years, so their journeys can sometimes lead to important new discoveries for others in the Impossible Lands and beyond.</p><p>Among themselves, ghorans cooperate easily and instinctively, with no need for a formal government. Work is apportioned by a silent consensus derived from thousands of years of experience, as everyone does what they're best at to cover necessary tasks. This silent consensus is already practiced at determining how to adjust and adapt when one ghoran falls ill or changes in a new incarnation. The addition of new ghorans traveling from afar or of members of other ancestries can sometimes throw off this natural rhythm. The new addition is an unknown quantity, so the entire community keeps tabs on the newcomers, to a potentially unsettling extent, for a short period of analysis. This practice isn't out of any distrust or desire for harm, but rather out of curiosity and a need to understand what the newcomers do well and where they need assistance. Once the ghoran community has drawn a conclusion, they adjust their actions accordingly—everyone simply begins to perform tasks differently to allow newcomers to fit in and contribute, with no official meeting or declaration. In most cases, one of the members of the community realizes they should tell non-ghoran newcomers what the community expects of them, but sometimes no one realizes there's a need to communicate. When this happens, it can leave the ghoran community and the newcomers perplexed at the others' actions and choices, as the community expects the newcomers to simply pitch in and fill the need while the newcomers wait to be told what the community expects of them.</p><p>Ghoran communities, operating on this ancient consensus, generally don't have anything resembling leaders. Nonetheless, a community will sometimes appoint a single ghoran as an envoy to outsiders and even give them a title to make the \"animals\" more comfortable when receiving a message from the whole community.</p><h2>Alignment and religion</h2><p>Ghorans typically lack driving forces toward good or evil, though their plant-derived values can sometimes make them come across as amoral to people who are not likewise plant based. They have a slight tendency toward law, especially in their own communities. While most ghorans aren't particularly religious, spiritually oriented ones tend to worship nature by means of the Green Faith or, less commonly, Gozreh or one of the Eldest (such as the plantlike Green Mother). They rarely find interest in human-centric deities, as ghorans have distinctly different thought processes and priorities. Faith is a matter that usually doesn't change much from seed to seed and incarnation to incarnation, and that means that the newer deities, especially those ascended in the last few millennia (\"recently,\" from the ghoran perspective) have almost no foothold in ghoran communities.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Most ghorans pick a new name with each incarnation, usually selecting a name or concept that they found pleasing in a past life. Occasionally, a ghoran might reuse a name for several incarnations in a row, especially if remaining in a community of other peoples, though each incarnation is still a distinct person.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Amsalu, Ash, Emnet, Sieri, Ooniel, Arshmarish, Velt, Delphinium, Hach, Emerald, Sable</p><h2>Ghoran Heritages</h2><p>Created with the express purpose of adapting to their environment, ghorans display several distinct physical morphs.

                "content": "<p>Long ago, early gnome ancestors emigrated from the First World, realm of the fey. While it's unclear why the first gnomes wandered to Golarion, this lineage manifests in modern gnomes as bizarre reasoning, eccentricity, obsessive tendencies, and what some see as naivete. Always hungry for new experiences, gnomes constantly wander both mentally and physically, attempting to stave off a terrible ailment that threatens all of their people. This affliction, known as the Bleaching, strikes gnomes who fail to dream, innovate, and take in new experiences. The Bleaching slowly drains the color—literally—from gnomes, and it plunges those affected into states of deep depression that eventually claim their lives. Very few gnomes survive this scourge, becoming deeply morose and wise survivors known as bleachlings.</p><p>If you want a character with boundless enthusiasm and an alien, fey outlook on morality and life, you should play a gnome.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Embrace learning and hop from one area of study to another without warning.</li><li>Speak, think, and move quickly, and lose patience with those who can't keep up.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Appreciate your enthusiasm and the energy with which you approach new situations.</li><li>Struggle to understand your motivations or adapt to your rapid changes of direction.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Most gnomes stand just over 3 feet in height and weigh little more than a human child. They exhibit a wide range of natural skin, hair, and eye colors. For gnomes that haven't begun the Bleaching, nearly any hair and eye color other than white is possible, with vibrant colors most frequent, while skin tones span a slightly narrower spectrum and tend toward earthy tones and pinkish hues, though occasionally green, black, or pale blue.</p><p>Gnomes typically reach physical maturity at the age of 18, though many gnomes maintain a childlike curiosity about the world even into adulthood. A gnome can theoretically live to any age if they can stave off the Bleaching indefinitely, but in practice gnomes rarely live longer than around 400 years.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>While most gnomes adopt some of the cultural practices of the region in which they live, they tend to pick and choose, adjusting their communities to fit their own fey logic. This often leads to majority gnome communities eventually consisting almost entirely of gnomes, as other people, bewildered by gnomish political decisions, choose to move elsewhere. Gnomes have little culture that they would consider entirely their own. Exceptionally few gnome kingdoms or nations exist on the surface of Golarion, and most gnomes wouldn't know what to do with such a state if they had one.</p><p>By necessity, few gnomes marry for life, instead allowing relationships to run their course before amicably moving on, the better to stave off the Bleaching with new experiences. Though gnome families tend to be small, many gnome communities raise children communally, with fluid family boundaries. Gnome names can get quite complex and polysyllabic. Gnomes rarely concern themselves with how easy their names are to pronounce, and they often go by shorter nicknames. Among gnomes, the shorter the name, the more feminine it's considered to be.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Abroshtor, Bastargre, Besh, Fijit, Halungalom, Krolmnite, Neji, Majet, Pai, Poshment, Queck, Trig, Zarzuket, Zatqualmie</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Though gnomes are impulsive tricksters with inscrutable motives and confusing methods, many at least attempt to make the world a better place.

Their skin ranges from green to gray to blue, and they often bear scars, boils, and rashes. Goblins average 3 feet tall. Most are bald, with little or no body hair. Their jagged teeth fall out and regrow constantly, and their fast metabolism means they eat constantly and nap frequently. Mutations are also more common among goblins than other peoples, and goblins usually view particularly salient mutations as a sign of power or fortune.</p><p>Goblins reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood 4 or 5 years later. Goblins can live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Goblins tend to flock to strong leaders, forming small tribes. These tribes rarely number more than a hundred, though the larger a tribe is, the more diligent the leader must be to keep order—a notoriously difficult task. Play and creativity matter more to goblins than productivity or study, and their encampments erupt with songs and laughter.</p><p>Goblins bond closely with their allies, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them or offered a sympathetic ear. Goblins tend to assume for their own protection that members of taller ancestries, which goblins often refer to colloquially as \"longshanks,\" won't treat them kindly. Learning to trust longshanks is difficult for a goblin, and it's been only in recent years that such a partnership has even been an option. Goblins keep their names simple. A good name should be easy to pronounce, short enough to shout without getting winded, and taste good to say.

                "content": "<p><em>Golomas fear most other people and deliberately use their unusual biology to frighten off those they consider to be dangerous predators. Rarely seen and poorly understood, golomas' many-eyed and wooden faced visages instill terror in most they meet.</em></p><hr /><p>Though just as capable of being dangerous as any intelligent creature on Golarion, golomas have a deep-rooted psychological understanding that they are prey, and that all two-eyed people are predators. As a result, golomas rarely reveal themselves to others, and when they do, they often adopt threatening personas as a means to protect themselves. Even those few golomas who venture out into greater Mwangi society often have trouble relating to other ancestries, due to their strong differences in perception and mindset.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Instinctively process large amounts of disparate information quickly and efficiently.</li><li>Project an air of intimidation to conceal your nervous disposition.</li><li>Have difficulty distinguishing individual objects or people from others that are similar.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Are frightened by your strange physiology.</li><li>Mistake your difficulties with identifying distinct people from one another as indifference.</li><li>Are awed by your skill at noticing minute details at a glance and drawing rapid conclusions.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Golomas are humanoids with rough skin that ranges in color from warm brown to ebony, although sickly gray or white individuals with albinism are not uncommon. Their fingers and feet are coated with a thin layer of chitin. A goloma's face is an oblong wedge made of smooth chitin, almost resembling a wooden mask. Protruding from this face are eight gelatinous, shining eyes. A goloma's mouth and jaw are located beneath their face-plate, and a bony crest juts from the top of their chitinous visage. The back of a goloma's head and neck is coated in black hair that is filled with thousands of tiny, peering eyes. These eyes tend to glow and squirm as they look around-an unsettling sight for most.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>An ancient goloma story states that during a calamity unleashed long ago, gods and demons burst forth from the earth to steal the eyes from other creatures. Only the golomas and others who were in hiding were spared-yet golomas soon began to be hunted by the now two-eyed people, who were hungry to take goloma eyes to replace what they had lost. This accurately sums up most golomas' mentalities: to be exposed is to be vulnerable, and to trust a stranger is deadly. Golomas usually travel and live with groups of other golomas, as this is where they feel most comfortable.</p><p>Golomas learn at a young age to be vigilant at all times, observing the environment for any irregularities and then reacting with quick, calculated instinct rather than deliberative action. Other ancestries often perceive golomas to be paranoid and hypervigilant. Golomas are also better at wide-scale observation than observation of specific things-they can easily notice commonalities across large fields but have difficulty remembering what a specific object or creature looked like. This only increases their paranoia, as they have trouble visually distinguishing known friends from potentially hostile foes.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Golomas tend to focus on their own survival and thus are typically neutral, though those who find more comfort in conformity than others trend toward lawful alignments. Golomas often pay homage to Kalekot, a deity of protective fear, as the guardian of their people, though not one to be trusted. Kalekot is called upon to curse those who victimize golomas, as most feel that justice can only be attained using supernatural means. Other popular gods include Mazludeh and Grandmother Spider, who encourage the strength of community, though a typical goloma's idea of community is often very insular.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>A goloma's true name is kept among golomas, as there are hundreds of cautionary tales of what could happen if another creature learns a goloma's true name. Names tend to lack soft syllables, which golomas often struggle to pronounce, and typically consist of hard consonants and individually enunciated vowels instead. Among other people, golomas tend to use names that are intended to be intimidating, taking elements and sounds from Aklo, Necril, or words from local languages that seem to cause strong reactions.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Biqkuul, Ehbouja, Haamaah, Kouzo, Quaerjii, Tebaazu, Uruueda, Zekuukeu</p><h2>Goloma Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 30 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Wisdom, Free</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Goloma, Mwangi</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

                "content": "<p>Claiming no place as their own, halflings control few settlements larger than villages. Instead, they frequently live among humans within larger cities, carving out small communities alongside taller folk. Optimistic, cheerful, and driven by powerful wanderlust, halflings make up for their short stature with an abundance of bravado. At once excitable and easygoing, halflings are the best kind of opportunists, and their passions favor joy over violence. While their curiosity sometimes drives them toward adventure, halflings also carry strong ties to house and home.</p><p>If you want to play a character who must contend with these opposing drives toward adventure and comfort, you should play a halfling.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Get along well with a wide variety of people and enjoy meeting new friends.</li><li>Find it difficult to resist indulging your curiosity, even when you know it's going to lead to trouble.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Appreciate your ability to always find a silver lining or something to laugh about, no matter how dire the situation.</li><li>Think you bring good luck with you.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Halflings are short humanoids who look vaguely like smaller humans. They rarely grow to be more than 3 feet in height. Halfling proportions vary, with some looking like shorter adult humans with slightly larger heads and others having proportions closer to those of a human child.</p><p>Most halflings prefer to walk barefoot rather than wear shoes, and those who do so develop roughly calloused soles on their feet over time. Tufts of thick, often-curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet. Halfling skin tones tend toward rich, tawny shades like amber or oak, and their hair color ranges from a light golden blond to raven black.</p><p>Halflings reach physical adulthood around the age of 20. A typical halfling can live to be around 150 years old.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Despite their jovial and friendly nature, halflings don't usually tend to congregate. They have few cultural centers in the Inner Sea region, and they instead tend to weave themselves throughout the societies of the world. Halflings eke out whatever living they can manage, many performing menial labor or holding simple service jobs. Some halflings reject city life, instead turning to the open road and traveling from place to place in search of fortune and fame. These nomadic halflings often travel in small groups, sharing hardships and simple pleasures among close friends and family. Halfling names are usually two to three syllables, with a gentle sound that avoids hard consonants. Preferring their names to sound humble, halflings see overly long or complex names as a sign of arrogance for their people. However, they understand that elves and humans might have longer names to suit their own aesthetics.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Anafa, Antal, Bellis, Boram, Etune, Filiu, Jamir, Kaleb, Linna, Marra, Miro, Rillka, Sistra, Sumak, Yamyra</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Halflings are loyal to their friends and their family, but they aren't afraid to do what needs to be done in order to survive. Wherever halflings go, they seamlessly blend into the society they find themselves in, adapting to the culture and beliefs of the predominant ancestry around them and adding their uniquely halfling twists, creating a blend of cultural diffusion that enriches both cultures. Halflings favor gods that either grant luck, like Desna, or encourage guile, like Norgorber, and many appreciate Cayden Cailean's role as a liberator, as well as any religions common among other ancestries around them.</p><h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4><p>share good meals with friends and strangers alike, stand up to bullies and oppressors, stay beneath the taller folk's notice</p><h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4><p>take your luck for granted</p><h2>Halfling Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Wisdom, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Strength</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Halfling</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

The Avistani cycle of unthinking conflict with hobgoblins has recently been upended by Oprak, the newly established hobgoblin nation in the mountains between Nidal and Nirmathas. Now under strict orders to not start conflicts with other nations, these hobgoblins have begun to cautiously investigate in the spirit of cooperation rather than conquest. Many people, especially those who suffered terrible cruelties caused by hobgoblins, fear that this is simply a pause in aggression while Oprak gains enough strength to crush its rivals.

Even civilian groups such as farming collectives or trading houses organize into regiments, companies, and divisions. Hobgoblin veterans hold a high place in their society, usually becoming leaders or advisors. Magic is rarely practiced and often derided, as most hobgoblins don't trust it over the strength of their own sword arms. Their arts tend to have a military bent; many hobgoblins consider stirring marches and weaponsmithing the only artistic endeavors worth pursuing.</p><p>Like goblins, hobgoblin names tend to be simple, though hobgoblin names usually sound more guttural and forceful. On rare occasions, hobgoblins will alter their names, keeping the core but adding aspects, usually in response to extreme trauma or a life-altering event.

The most common kashrishi, xyloshis, have a large primary horn and between one and three smaller horns, typically arranged linearly from the tip of their nose and spanning along their nose and brow.</p><p>While most kashrishi have light sandy or gray skin tones, their coloration can also echo the tones of their crystalline horns; sapphire, ruby, or emerald patterns aren't so uncommon as to cause another kashrishi to take notice. Kashrishi with strong connections to specific creatures with whom they share their home environments might take on skin patterns or colorations that mirror those creatures. Some stories even talk about kashrishi with wings and butterfly patterns that cover their bodies, though no such kashrishi has been seen in the Impossible Lands for at least a century.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Despite their small stature, kashrishi tend to be terrible at hiding. Their crystalline horns are likely to flare with magical light when they exercise their innate magical powers, and they're raised in an environment where their parents or guardians can almost always find them by feeling for their emotions. As a result, kashrishi tend to be excessively honest and kind, avoiding harmful deceptions but also employing enough tact to ensure they don't evoke unpleasant emotional reactions from others.</p><p>Kashrishi lack a clear concept of charity, not because they're cruel or inconsiderate, but rather because their worldview is inherently inclusive of the people around them. Rare indeed is the kashrishi who exercises casual cruelty or who leaves another member of the community in need. Such actions lead to emotional reactions that cause turmoil for all kashrishi in the vicinity.</p><p>Kashrishi enjoy various team games, employing games of trivia as measures of both knowledge and psychic ability. They also appreciate games that involve bluffs and double-bluffs with blind cards, testing their abilities to keep their minds clear and their thoughts organized. Kashrishi don't generally condone the act of gambling with outsiders, as many find it challenging to deal with the implications of their psychic abilities, even if they strive to keep their powers secret.</p><p>Kashrishi generally engage in monogamous relationships with no real preference toward any particular gender pairing. The height of intimacy for a kashrishi is opening their mind fully to the psychic link of another kashrishi, an act much more personal than anything physical. This act doesn't let kashrishi know whether someone is perfectly compatible with them or that the two mesh entirely—simply that from moment to moment, their inner feelings are more accessible and open, so communication becomes not a guessing game but an entirely wholesome, true experience. Some kashrishi believe that psychic communication should be held exclusively for these intimate moments.</p><p>Kashrishi can be found in small groups on the island of Jalmeray and in larger communities occupying the many smaller islands surrounding it. Kashrishi in the Inner Sea region rarely venture beyond the Impossible Lands, though some of their oldest stories speak of a harrowing voyage across the Obari Ocean when their kind fled some long-past disaster.</p><p>Kashrishi have no natural enemies. They host pirates and merchants with equal hospitality, so long as that hospitality is respected by their guests. While kashrishi are exceptionally tolerant of the quirks and foibles of other species, they draw a hard line at anyone bringing outside conflicts into their communities. More than one canny pirate captain docks their ship at a kashrishi island after a particularly heated conflict, knowing the pirate hunters and military vessels seeking them won't encroach on kashrishi lands. Escaped criminals hoping to find a new lease on life might also hide in a kashrishi community, doing whatever they can to assist their hosts until whoever is hunting them gives up the chase.</p><h2>Alignment and religion</h2><p>Most kashrishi are good, and almost instinctively kind because of their empathic abilities and tight-knit communities. Kashrishi are rarely interested in religion, though a few deities are more likely to be worshipped by kashrishi than others. Desna is known to kashrishi as \"The Crystal Butterfly,\" and when a kashrishi child goes missing, their parents might pray the Crystal Butterfly uses the light of her wings to guide the child home. Besmara is also unusually likely to be worshipped by kashrishi, though her dogma among them is essentially a splinter faith that focuses on her primacy over sea monsters and storms with little regard to the piratical teachings for which most other ancestries know the goddess.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>The empathic sense of a kashrishi has its own \"mental fingerprint\" that's unique to each member of the species, and this mental fingerprint can be conveyed through psychic communications as a name. Kashrishi who adventure with non-kashrishi often adopt descriptive names that their companions can more easily speak and remember.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Climber, Firehorn, Guardian, Healer, Lantern, Mother, Scout, Softhand, Tempest, Warrior</p><h2>Kashrishi Heritages</h2><p>A kashrishi's heritage reflects the unique evolutionary qualities they've adapted for their chosen environments.

Kholo are eminently practical and pragmatic hunters and raiders. To them, honor is just another word for pointless risk. Any loss of a kholo affects not just the individual, but their packmates and kin as well. Wasting time on anything but victory, whether it's mercy or cruelty, is seen as little shy of immoral. Kholo are masters of ambushes, tactical feints, and psychological warfare. Equally misunderstood is the kholo practice of ancestor worship and endocannibalism. Kholo consume their dead as a sign of reverence, holding a grand feast and transforming the bones into art or weapons. Kholo extend this honor to respected foes, hoping to bring their enemy's cunning or strength into the clan.</p><h2>You might...</h2><ul><li>Be physically demonstrative—hugging, punching, or licking your friends.</li><li><p>Keep a bone from a favorite relative to ask for advice.</p></li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Are intimidated by your size, teeth, and eerie laugh.</li><li><p>Respect the brutal efficiency of your hunting style.</p></li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Kholo are hyena-like humanoids with short muzzles, sharp teeth, and large and expressive round ears. Their bodies are covered in shaggy fur, rougher on the back and softer and lighter on the stomach and throat, usually in an off-white, tan, or brown shade; spots and stripes are both common. Kholo typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall. Women are usually about a head taller than men and correspondingly stronger. Kholo are considered adults at 15 and live about 60 years on average.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Kholo generally live in semi-nomadic clans of 10 to 20 family groups, containing between 100 to 200 members. They are ruled by a council of female kholo who are typically selected from the elders of each family. Bonekeepers focus on tending to the wishes of kholo ancestors and gods—they take their name from the ancestral bones that festoon their clothing and homes. Storytellers serve as teachers and sages, and are expected to have an encyclopedic knowledge of clan history, regional lore, and anything else relevant to the clan.</p><p>Newborn kholo are given a root name, typically that of a bone, plant, or animal (though never Hyena, as this is considered narcissistic).

                "content": "<p><em>Kitsune are a charismatic and witty people with a connection to the spiritual that grants them many magical abilities, chiefly the power to shapechange into other forms. Whether they pass unseen among other peoples or hold their tails high, kitsune are clever observers of the societies around them.</em></p><hr /><p>Kitsune are shapechangers with two forms: one of a fox-headed humanoid and one largely depending on where they were raised. Those raised in populated areas typically have what's called a tailless form—a humanoid body without any fox features that resembles a more common ancestry, such as an elf or a human. In wooded or rural areas, their second form is more likely to be that of a fox.</p><p>Though all-kitsune settlements exist, most live among people of other ancestries, granting them a degree of external insight into social rules or dynamics that others process only subconsciously. Kitsune enjoy subverting expectations as much as they do going along with them. Their fondness for jokes, stories, and wordplay, especially when the twist of a riddle hinges on the listener's assumptions, reinforces their reputation as tricksters.</p><p>With dual forms and a connection to both the material and spiritual worlds, kitsune have diverse concepts of self and identity. Some even view their forms as separate individuals altogether, using them to explore different aspects of their personality.</p><p>If you want to play a character with innate magical talents and countless hidden facets, each revealed with a glint of the eye and a twisting grin, you should play a kitsune.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Studiously observe the habits of those around you, taking mental notes on how to imitate them better.</li><li>Delight in jokes, clever wordplay, pranks, or unnecessarily complex plots.</li><li>Present a different, but authentic, side of yourself in each new situation.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Are taken in by your magnetic personality and enigmatic nature.</li><li>Marvel at your many supernatural abilities.</li><li>Wonder what you aren't telling them.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Kitsune have alert vulpine ears, pointed snouts, and short, semi-retractable claws on their fingers and toes. Their fur is dense, countershaded, and most often red,tan, black, or white in color. Kitsune have bushy tails that grow in number as they hone their innate magical abilities, to as many as nine.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Kitsune are rarely the majority in whatever communities they inhabit, and many go their whole lives without meeting another kitsune beyond their family. Their society, as much as it exists, centers primarily around the commonalities that kitsune find as they pass among other peoples. The same social perspective that helps them imitate others also makes them quick to notice signs that someone may need help or a kind word. Due to this, kitsune often form strong interpersonal relationships and tend to anchor their social circles.</p><p>When two kitsune do meet, they may find themselves exchanging light verbal repartee, enjoying the sport of trying to outwit each other. While it's considered a grave offense to outright give away another kitsune's shapechanging nature, kitsune relish surreptitiously forcing another to \"break character,\" shocking the other into disrupting their transformation through a well-placed comment.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Kitsune often have neutrality in their alignment from balancing their dual natures, though their instinct for stirring up trouble leads many to lean slightly toward chaos. Some possess the ability to control or bend the will of others, but even among those that do, only the evilest use these arts flippantly or selfishly.</p><p>The patron kitsune deity is Daikitsu, the goddess of crafting and agriculture. Though not all kitsune necessarily worship Daikitsu, most respect her as the purported source of their powers. Kitsune in Tian Xia often revere both Shizuru and Tsukiyo, seeing the duality of the sun and moon in their own multifaceted nature. A small sect of Avistani kitsune worship Sivanah, the goddess of illusion, respecting her position between perception and reality and believing the goddess's true form to be that of a kitsune-hidden behind not seven veils, but nine.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>While kitsune have some traditional names, they're more likely to use names that are unremarkable in their local society, the better to pass unnoticed. Some have different names for each form: a kitsune name for their kitsune form, a regional name for a tailless form, and possibly no name at all for a fox form.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Hamako, Haohiko, Kitsukou, Kon, Kwan-la, Talaro</p><h2>Kitsune Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Charisma, Free</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

If your heritage doesn't list a form, your alternate form is a tailless form, which is a common Medium humanoid ancestry prevalent where you grew up (typically human). This form is the same age and body type as your true form and has roughly analogous physical traits, such as hair color. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception. You lose any unarmed Strikes you gained from a kitsune heritage or ancestry feat in this form. You can remain in your alternate form indefinitely, and you can shift back to your true kitsune form by using this action again.</p><h2>Kitsune Heritages</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Celestial Envoy Kitsune]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Dark Fields Kitsune]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Earthly Wilds Kitsune]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Empty Sky Kitsune]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Frozen Wind Kitsune]</p>",

Kobolds seek out these alliances out of a sense of pragmatism—after all, who would dare bully a kobold who serves an ancient dragon?—but also because kobold eggs incubated near such loci of power take on physical traits (and sometimes abilities) similar to those of the warren's benefactor. On their own, kobolds are ingenious crafters and devoted allies, but outsiders who trespass into their territory find them to be inspired skirmishers and clever ambushers. However, these reptilian opportunists prove happy to cooperate with other humanoids when it's to their benefit, combining caution and cunning to make their fortunes in the wider world.</p><p>If you want a character with deadly cunning and who bears the mark of a powerful benefactor, you should play a kobold.</p><h2>You might...</h2><ul><li>Analyze your surroundings, always looking for ambushes, advantageous terrain, and escape routes.</li><li><p>Naturally observe, adopt, and respect group dynamics, whether as leader, subordinate, or equal.</p></li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Assume that you are cowardly and won't stick around in the face of danger.</li><li><p>Appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness, especially when it comes to building defenses</p></li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Kobolds are short (about 3 feet tall), reptilian humanoids with slender bodies, long tails, and stout horns.

Some rare kobolds live even longer after harnessing the power of a magical benefactor.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Kobolds have an ingrained cautiousness that keeps them alive. They're secretive or subservient around powerful creatures to avoid becoming victims. This meekness fades once kobolds secure either a formidable benefactor (like a dragon) or a potent source of supernatural power (like an artifact or sorcerous leader). Kobold societies regularly adopt laws and cultural norms inspired by their benefactor's personality. However, kobolds are infamous for sensing a proverbial sinking ship, and once their source of power fails or seems doomed, their morale breaks swiftly.</p><p>A young kobold's given name is rarely more than a syllable or two.

As guardians and emissaries of the environment, leshies are \"born\" when a skilled druid or other master of primal magic conducts a ritual to create a suitable vessel, and then a spirit chooses that vessel to be their temporary home. Leshies are self-sufficient from the moment the ritual ends, though it isn't uncommon for leshies to maintain lifelong bonds with their creators. Many leshies relish the opportunity to interact with the physical world. While most leshy spirits are ancient, they rarely recall past lifetimes and see their new life as a chance to experience the wonders of the world once more. If you want to play a character who is curious and connected to nature, you should play a leshy.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Act as a traveling agent for natural guardians who are unable to leave their territories.</li><li>Encourage civilizations to cooperate with nature and build their cities in ecologically friendly ways.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Think you are a curiosity due to your spiritual origins.</li><li>Assume you know only about nature and are unfamiliar with civilization and society.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Leshies are as varied as the material used to create their vessels, usually appearing as a bizarre mishmash of various plants or fungi. Their bodies are vaguely humanoid in shape, with numerous characteristics of the plant or fungus from which they were made. A typical leshy is about 3 feet tall. Leshies begin their lives as adults and don't age.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>To most leshies, the concept of family is not a matter of birth, but rather determined by bonds of loyalty and friendship. Leshies are dedicated allies, but they have little tolerance for those who would despoil nature. As much as they are happy to accept someone who earns their trust into their family, they expect family members to look out for them and their natural wards in return. Leshies are grouped into categories akin to ethnicities, but these are not connected to physical features; rather, they represent broad categories of characteristics of their spirits. Certain spirits are more likely to gravitate toward particular physical bodies, though this predisposition is far from absolute. Leshies' genders are determined by the spirits that inhabit their bodies. Some leshies are exclusively male or female, while many consider themselves both. Others, particularly fungus leshies, tend toward far more complex expressions of gender, or eschew the concept entirely. Leshies choose and change their names multiple times throughout their lives.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Scarlet in Summer, Verdant Taleweaver, Lurking Hunter, Masterful Sun Drinker, Noon Sky Evening Song, Snowy Pine Branch, Cascading Rapids</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Leshies' beliefs generally focus on the natural world.

Though lizardfolk have adapted to many different environments, many of them still prefer to remain near bodies of water, using their ability to hold their breath to their advantage.

The average lizardfolk stands 6 to 7 feet tall, but grows throughout their lifetime, gaining strength and size with age.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Known among themselves as iruxis, lizardfolk are raised communally from the moment they break from their shells. They have an oral tradition stretching back thousands of years, brought to life through epic poems, evocative carvings, and ancestral rites performed among fields of fossilized bone.

If they seem slow to act, it's because their long history has taught them the value of patience.</p><p>True iruxi settlements are often overlooked, as they are partially or mostly submerged in water.

                "content": "<p>Merfolk live in every ocean of Golarion, infinite in their variety and awe-inspiring in their majesty. They consider themselves, not without some merit, the rulers of the sea. Among the tropical reefs of the Fever Sea, merfolk build temples and palaces of brightly colored corals. Beneath the ice floes of the Shining Sea, merfolk hunt seals and whales for food in small, standoffish clans. In the Embaral Ocean, merfolk populate the great trading city of Alohmab, built into the shell of a titanic snail that crawls across the ocean floor.</p><p>Though merfolk's everyday lives aren't all that different from those of the surface dwellers above, they have a much more intimate relationship with magic. In the aquatic environment of the open ocean, much that relies on fire and metal is impossible. Instead, merfolk shape sound and water with magic, using them as both tools and weapons. Such skills are widely distributed throughout all merfolk communities, even among those without formal magical training.</p><p>If you want to play a character who embodies the grace, wonder, and danger of the sea, you should play a merfolk.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Consider magic a normal tool, something common and useful, rather than a sublime mystery.</li><li>Have a sense of superiority when it comes to the water, whether that be arrogant disdain for anyone who swims or sails or parental concern that they might hurt themselves.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Are impressed by your musical and mystical talents.</li><li>Assume that life beneath the waves is vastly different than life on the surface.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Merfolk are among the most distinct ancestries on Golarion; one can't really mistake a merfolk for anything else. From the waist up, merfolk have the bodies of humanoids with powerful bodies and sharp, aquadynamic features. Their eyes are a little larger than those of a human, and many have slightly pointed ears, similar to those of aiuvarins. Below the waist, merfolk have the bodies of great fish, each with a long, scaled tail ending in a fin or pair of fins.</p><p>Merfolk come in every color of skin and scale imaginable. Most often, their human bodies have skin tones similar to those of humans or elves living in the same area—the merfolk of the Shackles, for instance, bear a certain similarity to the Lirgeni, while those who live in the Steaming Sea somewhat resemble their Ulfen neighbors. Merfolk who dwell farther from land take on colorations closer to fish tones of blue, gray, or even green. Deep-sea abyssal merfolk have dark gray, midnight blue, or even translucent skin.</p><p>Merfolk fish tails are colored similarly to local fish populations. In the temperate zones where most merfolk live, they have iridescent, silvery bodies with traces of gray or blue; tropical merfolk might display patterns of brilliant colors, while those born in the depths might have translucent scales or faintly bioluminescent stripes.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Merfolk can be found in the corners of every ocean, but the largest concentration lives in sprawling aquatic kingdoms on continental shelves, usually in temperate waters teeming with fish. Merfolk look at the deep water in roughly the same way that surface dwellers look at mountains or deserts: some people can live there, but it isn't exactly ideal terrain. Merfolk territories consist of several settled villages and cities, sometimes organized under aristocratic families with courtly politics to rival those found in any Inner Sea monarchy. These political entities pursue active diplomacy with one another, making alliances and trade treaties. Many tend to be more standoffish toward surface dwellers, but some are fascinated by the surface and actively seek to learn about it, whether by using specialized water-filled mobility devices to come onshore or through ancient transformation magics.</p><p>Merfolk value magic very highly, and any merfolk hoping to rise to a leadership role is expected to have a powerful grasp of the sorcery of wind, wave, and song. Merfolk kings and queens aren't necessarily the most powerful mages in their territories, but they're usually not far from it, as they have access to a wealth of teachings and artifacts passed down from one generation to the next.</p><p>Merfolk have as many naming patterns as there are merfolk cultures, but a few tendencies predominate. Dolphin-like clicks and whale-like groans punctuate mellifluous merfolk names, and variances in pitch and tone help distinguish similar names from one another. Merfolk who regularly deal with surface dwellers often adopt names borrowed from local surface cultures, especially since merfolk names tend to sound strange and awkward to their own ears when pronounced in air rather than water.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Aloori, Iri'kik, Ouliette, T'konaa, Uathanak</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>In general, merfolk follow the morals and customs of their parents and the communities in which they were raised. These vary greatly throughout the world. For instance, some merfolk are expected to live harmoniously with nature, while others follow a rigid set of laws ordained by their ancestors. Many merfolk believe that acts of altruism raise a community as a whole, even if they don't immediately produce beneficial results for the one who performed the deed in the first place.</p><p>Merfolk worship is, like their societies, diverse. Deities with control over water are placed in high regard, and most communities have a shrine to Gozreh or one of the Elemental Lords of Water: Kelizandri or Lysianassa. Abadar is a popular god in some larger merfolk settlements, and a version of Erastil—more associated with sharks than with stags—is worshipped in smaller villages.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p><p>aid one's neighbor whenever possible, bring the beauty of music to the world, protect the seas from threats within and without</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p><p>fight the current head-on, use magic to harm innocents or hoard wealth</p><h2>Merfolk Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 5 feet Swim 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Charisma, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Constitution</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Thalassic, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

                "content": "<p>Minotaurs stalk complex passageways, whether natural or artificial, and are masters of stone architecture. Inquisitive and steadfast, these bovine humanoids spend their lives perfecting the pursuit that calls to them, which can sometimes lead them far from the enclaves where they were raised. Minotaurs are originally from the Iblydos archipelago but have spread far and wide across Golarion, forming close-knit communities often near mountains or beneath the surface of the earth. Though sometimes mistaken for simple brutes, minotaurs have scholars and warriors alike. Those who can look past their appearance will find an affinity for building and navigation, as well as creative problem-solving.</p><p>The myth many minotaurs tell of their origins is one of craft, curses, and misunderstanding. Millennia ago, Iblydos was filled with living deities who walked among and ruled the mortal people. A stonemason named Tavdrinos, admired by mortals and hero-gods alike, received a vision from a hero-god to create a glorious temple, though the myth doesn't name which one. The mason found the images of the vision murky: scrambled glimpses of twisting columns, charging bulls, and a defiant stand made by an unknown figure. It was hardly a detailed commission, but one does not refuse a divine order. The mason labored for 17 years before his task was done. The three-story temple celebrated the glory of the hero-god and their sacred animal, the bull. Upon the herogod's arrival, Tavdrinos expected to be met with praise and congratulations, but the deity flew into a rage instead. Tavdrinos had misunderstood the vision, for the bull was a hated beast, not a celebrated ally. As punishment for this accidental insult, the hero-god cursed Tavdrinos with the hated shape of the bull. Angered by both the curse and his failure to please the deity, the mason retreated to a series of caves under the temple, where he continued his work as the first minotaur.</p><p>If you want to play a character with strength of body, who expresses themselves through craft more than words, you should play a minotaur.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Decorate your hooves and horns with designs or colors of personal significance.</li><li>Be adept at navigation and puzzles.</li></ul><h2>Others Might…</h2><ul><li>Be intimidated by your size or think you calculating.</li><li>Think you can see through stone.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Minotaurs are tall, bulky humanoids with the bovine features such as horns, hooves, and elongated faces. Their fur patterns are frequently monotone in deep browns or blacks, though white or gray aren't uncommon. Though the large size of a minotaur might cause one think they are clumsy, the truth is quite the opposite. Minotaur hooves rest on a delicate balance point, making their footfalls quiet and precise. However, when there is a need to be heard, the steps of a minotaur can fall like thunder.</p><p>A minotaur's horns are a source of pride and often accented by pieces of fashion. Those with longer horns add rings and chains around them, cast in whatever rare metals are affordable, or dye or engrave patterns along them. Those with not much horn to speak of instead shave their fur around the base of the horns, possibly adding stylish circular tattoos to the surrounding skin or fitting metal caps onto their tips. This draws attention to an otherwise overlooked feature.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Minotaurs typically reside within insular, subterranean communal enclaves. They take great pride in their architectural prowess, hewing buildings out of stone and natural caves alike. An enclave often has almost twice as many buildings as it needs, with the extra structures serving as functional art. Young minotaurs practice their hunting and stalking skills in the empty buildings, with each generation adding a small expansion or fresco on the walls. Expansions like twisting hallways, unexpected overhangs, shared gardens, and a variety of other such contrivances create numerous social spaces and quiet areas for calm reflection, so long as the traveler is able to keep from becoming lost by the unusual architectural flow.</p><p>Myths surrounding minotaurs lead most to believe they are fierce carnivores, or even cannibals in the darkest of legends. In reality, most minotaur societies are hunter-gatherers, feeding off lichen and other flora. Their reputation as fierce hunters stems from monthly rituals, when the most accomplished stalkers venture out and bring back dangerous prey. The return of these hunters is one of the few occasions minotaurs indulge in meat, feasting on the kills as a show of gratitude and reverence for the hunters' skills.</p><p>Minotaurs tend to be blunt and literal, rarely engaging in overly clever wordplay, sarcasm, or irony. Flaring nostrils and rolling eyes can be intimidating expressions when viewed by non-minotaurs, but to a minotaur, they can convey a complex story with emotional and even spiritual elements. Minotaurs wishing to emphasize a certain emotion occasionally use piercings and tattoos, though minotaurs who lean too heavily into these adornments to look fierce often come off as a bit foolish to their peers. The minotaur saying \"an angry bull stamps once and gores twice\" is both an admonition against overly aggressive displays and a reminder that the creature truly to be feared is one who speaks with their actions.</p><p>Iblydan minotaurs often have names similar to the names of humans from that archipelago. Minotaur surnames are ever-changing, typically reflecting the most memorable achievement an individual has accomplished. Until adulthood, an Iblydan minotaur bears the surname Tavdrinos (after the first minotaur). Once they reach maturity, their childhood friends and allies collectively bestow a fitting surname. Minotaurs in adventuring groups might be renamed multiple times by their allies.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Actilea, Iraiasos, Paxaidio, Rotherion, Zavmandris</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Long traditions of isolation have resulted in most minotaurs taking an evenhanded approach to events. Many tend toward an unbiased outlook that allows for adaptation. Those who have poor interactions with other humanoids, particularly those met with violence or intolerance, might choose to recede into a chosen lair, ruin, or fortification that they guard fiercely, which sadly perpetuates the tales of brutal minotaurs.</p><p>Minotaurs raised by their own people tend to avoid association with deities of any stripe—little surprise given their creation legend. Divine beings are thought of as petty and uncaring, if not by intent then by the sheer magnitude of their power. Many minotaurs adopt logical or spiritual philosophies as a way of reconciling their existence. Mysteries are puzzles yet unanswered, ones that can be explained with careful thought and study. When minotaurs decide to follow deities, they're primarily drawn to those concerned with self-improvement and self-control, like Irori and Nethys.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p><p>construct architecture of lasting beauty, seek out ever more perplexing puzzles, hone one's prowess</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p><p>leave fate to godly hands rather than mortal initiative, pass up the chance to investigate a mystery</p><h2>Minotaur Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Large</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Strength, Constitution, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Jotun, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

They hold a deep reverence for holy areas and spiritual truths, an aspect many others find as intimidating as a nagaji's appearance.</p><p>Nagaji are creations of the goddess Nalinivati, who was inspired by both humans and nagas. This inspiration, alongside nagaji's devotion to nagas, has led many to claim nagaji were created to be servants. However, Nalinivati created nagaji simply for the sake of creating. She envisioned a world where nagas and nagaji worked together to succeed, with nagas serving as sacred guardians, and nagaji living as mortals upon Golarion, respecting nagas for their strength and wisdom. Nagaji live up to this expectation, forming nations, temples, and villages with as many varied governments, societies, and traditions as there are scales on a serpent's back. If nagaji can be said to share any trait, it's devotion, be it to a community, a temple, a concept, or a lifestyle. Most nagaji are also drawn to the spiritual in all its expressions, even the darker aspects of philosophies and religions.</p><p>If you want a character who combines the crushing strength and the sinuous mystery of a serpent, you should play a nagaji.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Enjoy the intersection of spirituality and everyday life.</li><li>Have deep reserves of patience for tasks others might find boring.</li><li>Adhere to strong beliefs and traditions about your place in the universe.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Assume you have no goals or interests beyond serving nagas.</li><li>Find your unblinking eyes and serpentine features intimidating.</li><li>Are awed by your connection and dedication to holy natural places.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Nagaji are prone to sharp differences in appearance. Some have tails alongside legs, some have sharp claws on their hands and feet, and some are so unique from their kin that they're mistaken for lamias rather than nagaji. The most common nagaji features are a serpentine head and a humanoid body. They usually have the unblinking eyes of a snake, though other peoples often claim a nagaji's gaze is far more intense. Scales cover nagaji bodies, with patterns that resemble those of snakes or nagas. Depending on their heritage, a nagaji's neck might be as long as a swan's or as short as a human's, and many have a frill of skin or scales down their back. Nagaji tend to possess crushing strength, but how it manifests can vary; some have bulky figures, while others have the slender yet powerful musculature of a snake.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Nagaji communities widely vary, from ancient empires to tiny fishing villages. They tend to be isolated from other peoples, more as a matter of convenience than choice; nagaji have different physical needs than most ancestries, so even when integrated into mixed communities, they tend to live with other nagaji. Everything from marriage traditions, religion, social roles, valued arts, and methods of governance differs in specific nagaji communities. Within these communities, however, nagaji often have very strict and traditional views on these topics. Multiple instances of wars between nagaji have come about due to one group of nagaji finding another's practices unacceptable. This perspective applies to relations with other peoples as well. For instance, most nagaji consider themselves rivals and enemies of garudas due to their historical legends, even if the nagaji involved have never even seen a garuda.</p><p>Nagaji originated in the Tian Xia region of Nagajor. Though they have since spread across Golarion to regions such as Vudra and Jalmeray, many of them still carry traditions from their ancestral homeland. Tian and Vudrani concepts of elements, medicine, and spirituality are highly common among nagaji, especially given their tendency of seeing themselves as highly pious beings. Nagaji mostly eschew the human concept of castes, beyond the vague view of a \"natural order\" that sees nagas as holy guides to mortal nagaji, but they can see the appeal of the concept of karma and the righteousness of fulfilling their proper role in the universe. While they have little physical need for clothes, as they stick to hot and humid environments, nagaji wear them with pride and treat them as decorative elements in the same manner as jewelry.</p><p>As nagas are usually matriarchal, nagaji have a strong respect for women in leadership positions. Not all nagaji follow suit with matriarchal societies, but they tend to trace lineage through the mother, and almost no nagaji societies are strictly patriarchal.</p><h2>Alignment and religion</h2><p>Nagaji are most commonly neutral but otherwise don't have any strong pull toward specific alignments. The presence of a naga can sway nagaji toward that naga's ethos, but a nagaji's view on life tends to be determined by the culture to which they belong.</p><p>Nagaji overwhelmingly worship Nalinivati, their creator, to the point that any nagaji who pay homage to a different god over Nalinivati provoke strong negative reactions from their kin. While nagaji believe reverence for Ravithra, the supposed mother of nagas, to be proper and accept it more readily than other faiths, most believe Ravithra shouldn't be troubled with the requests of mortal adherents. A very small minority of nagaji in Jalmeray are drawn to the worship of the war god Diomazul; these adherents are tolerated by other nagaji, but seen as just as terrifying and dangerous as their patron god and usually avoided.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Nagaji names vary depending on what region of the world they occupy, but they tend to possess short vowels when they have any at all. Nagaji usually name themselves or allow groups of siblings to name each other as children, a tradition that often sees nagaji eagerly shedding these names for new ones when they reach adulthood.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Adesha, Garija, Kaya, Kuwana, Onok, Paravata, Sheni, Takasha, Tasi, Ulu, Vaski, Yulbin</p><h2>Nagaji Heritages</h2><p>Nagaji physiology commonly varies between individuals.

                "content": "<p>Orcs are forged in the fires of violence and conflict, often from the moment they are born. As they live lives that are frequently cut brutally short, orcs revel in testing their strength against worthy foes, often by challenging a higher-ranking member of their community for dominance. Orcs often struggle to gain acceptance among other communities, who frequently see them as brutes. Those who earn the loyalty of an orc friend, however, soon learn that an orc's fidelity and honesty are unparalleled. Orc culture teaches that they are shaped by the challenges they survive, and the most worthy survive the most hardships. Orcs who attain both a long life and great triumphs command immense respect.</p><p>If you want a character who is hardy, fearsome, and excels at feats of physical prowess, you should play an orc.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Eagerly meet any chance to prove your strength in a physical contest.</li><li>View dying in glorious combat as preferable to a mundane death from old age or illness.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>See you as violent or lacking in discipline.</li><li>Admire your forthrightness and blunt honesty.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Orcs are tall and powerfully built, with long arms and stocky legs. Many orcs top 7 feet in height, though they tend to adopt broad, almost bow-legged stances and slouch forward at the shoulders. Orcs have rough skin, thick bones, and rock-hard muscles, making them suited to war and other physically demanding tasks. Orc skin color is typically some shade of green, though some orcs have other skin colors that reflect adaptations to their environments.</p><p>Orcs consider powerful builds, heavily scarred skin, large tusks, and tattoos attractive, regardless of gender. Orcs reach physical adulthood around the age of 17, with many orcs living to be up to 60 years old.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Most orc communities—known as holds—define themselves through two things: pain and glory. Each earns respect in near equal measure, so long as the pain is borne with stoicism. An orc with many scars who walks uncomplaining with a broken leg draws as much admiration as one who wins a great victory on the battlefield. Additionally, power defines the dynamics among families and holds. Weaker orcs work at the behest of the strong, with power constantly shifting between orcs that prove their might. Orcs tend to share in familial duties, raising children as a community and sharing responsibilities among the entire hold.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Arkus, Durra, Grask, Grillgiss, Krugga, Mahja, Murdut, Ollak, Onyat, Thurk, Uirch, Unach</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>A common orc saying is \"you are the scars that shape you.\" Violent, chaotic lives in violent, chaotic lands mean that most orcs tend to expect and accept violence. Lamashtu, and Rovagug are commonly worshiped among more war-minded orc communities, while less violent holds worship gods like Sarenrae, whose tenets of fire, redemption, and glory all hold some appeal to orc sensibilities.</p><p>While there are orc deities, their worship is surprisingly uncommon among orcs. Orcs believe that if a creature has a face and a name, it can be killed, and so their own deities are often targets, rather than objects of reverence. Some orc holds teach that the greatest members of the hold can earn a chance to challenge the orc deities for a place amid the pantheon.</p><h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4><p> become even stronger, share knowledge you won through pain, destroy the undead</p><h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4><p> accept defeat without proof of strength, reshape or reanimate a creature into something lesser</p><h2>Orc Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Two free attribute boosts</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Orcish</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

                "content": "<p><em>Poppets are small, basic constructs that typically help their owners with simple tasks. Occasionally, poppets gain sapience, independence, and a spark of life. Elevated beyond mere helpers or playthings, these poppets are free to chart their own destinies.</em></p><hr /><p>Most commonly made of cloth, wicker, and wood, poppets are among the simplest of constructs. They serve as helpers to fetch tools, clean dishes, tidy rooms, or perform other light tasks. Their size and appearance vary, but nearly all poppets appear humanoid in shape and between 1 to 3 feet tall. They're usually roughly made with button eyes sewn onto blank faces, strings of yarn in place of hair, and a simple dress or tunic made from coarse, cheap cloth. Wealthy families sometimes purchase poppets as toys, with their squishy bodies and stitched smiles, to keep their children company. Most poppets can't speak and lack the intellect to understand speech beyond preprogrammed orders. Poppets can become familiars.</p><p>Very, very rarely, a common poppet spontaneously manifests a spark of life-a tiny bit of life essence- and becomes a thinking, independent creature. These events are exceedingly rare; fewer than one in a thousand gain this spark. A poppet might manifest this life essence through a magical fluke in its construction, a brush with ephemeral spirits, or even the fervent wish of a loving child. Whatever their origin, the poppets described here as an ancestry have their own life and free will. They might consider their creators or former owners to be friends, but they acknowledge no one as their master and often leave comfortable homes or workshops to seek their place in the world.</p><p>Sapient living poppets usually refer to themselves as \"awakened\" to indicate the moment they gained clear and true self-awareness. Poppets might talk about this event as the time they \"popped up,\" \"woke up,\" or \"sparked alive.\" Most poppets celebrate two special anniversaries each year: the day of their initial creation (which, for most poppets, they must learn secondhand or by studying their creator's records) and the day they awoke to true consciousness.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Like surprising others with your unexpected cleverness and eloquence.</li><li>Seek out other self-aware beings that most people might overlook.</li><li>Rely on your harmless appearance to trick others.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Mistake you for a toy.</li><li>Doubt your ability to handle tasks that require any dexterity or complex thought.</li><li>Wonder whether your mundane form conceals other magical marvels.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Living poppets are both humanoids and constructs, which gives them some of the benefits and drawbacks of each category. Their bodies are usually made of wood and wicker, but they can be made of cloth, leather, tin, stuffing, or delicate clockwork. Either way, poppets burn or melt quickly and must take care to avoid fire. They virtually never look alike, as each is created from unique and unusual circumstances.</p><p>Poppets are fully alert and self-aware when they awaken to sentience; although they might not know much at first, they instantly gain intelligence and consciousness. They must breathe and sleep, and they must consume food and water each day; through a sort of magical digestion they can restore rips, tears, or scuffs in their physical form. Poppets don't age the same way fleshy creatures do, but they slowly wear down in physical form as well as in mental acuity. A poppet that tends to their body and mind (and takes care to avoid fire) can live up to 30 years.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Free-willed poppets are so rare that almost no such poppet has met another. Poppets normally live with larger creatures, though not always their creators, and tend to get along well in societies sized for larger creatures. Most live in cities because that's where toy makers, clockwork crafters, and other specialists have their shops, but poppets created by lonely hermits or reclusive inventors might prefer a life in the wilderness. Poppets often stay on the lookout for other creatures who, like them, have stumbled into self-awareness. They might have regular conversations with animated objects, golems, houseplants, statues, or toys, in which they're deeply polite out of a desire to leave a good impression for the time when the object \"wakes up.\"</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Ordinary poppets are built as helpers and companions, and awakened poppets tend to retain this drive to aid others. They're therefore generally good, and more poppets are lawful than chaotic. Some spend their time trying to uncover secrets of their creation, find others like them, or keep out of trouble; these poppets are generally neutral in alignment. Poppets aren't typically religious unless a particular faith defined their creation, such as being made from scraps of Iomedaean altar cloth or woven from reeds around a sacred Gozren pool. These poppets tend to be vocally religious, even zealous, in their faith. Poppets who find religion later in their lives often revere Brigh, Casandalee, or Nethys.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Poppets generally choose their own names, usually descriptive nicknames based on their materials, patterns, size, or demeanor. They tend to pick up and shed nicknames throughout their lives, and they happily adopt nicknames given to them by people they like. A poppet fashioned to look like a particular person, such as a doll sewn to resemble a deceased child, might proudly take the name of that person.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Burlap, Buttoneyes, Checker, Clockwhirr, Fivestitch, Nettle, Scramble, Stuffing, Taffeta, Tattercap</p><h2>Poppets of the Inner Sea</h2><p>Awkward and endearing, poppets are well-regarded in all but the most insular and superstitious communities of Golarion. They're known to be able, helpful, and loyal little creatures who support a master's work or make an aristocrat's life easier, which is particularly true in large trade cities such as Absalom, Almas, the city of Katapesh, and Katheer. The key difference between ordinary poppets and living poppets, in most people's experiences, is responsive speech. Ordinary poppets usually can't talk; if they can, they reproduce only a few preprogrammed phrases by rote. They normally communicate with strangers via notes pinned to their bodies, like walking note boards. Awakened poppets not only talk but carry on lengthy, expressive conversations, which likely strikes even the most jaded urbanite as a marvelous wonder.</p><p>In regions where an entrenched nobility enjoys flaunting their wealth, poppets are even built specifically as toys. Taldor and Cheliax teem with aristocrats who pamper their children, grooming them for a life of leisure and devotion to family honor. These children have the best and most expensive toys, including poppets in fancy, frilly clothing. Such poppets are sometimes armed with subtle weaponry to fight against kidnappers or assassins who threaten their charges. Commoners in these nations treat poppets with deference and caution, as no one wants to risk the wrath of a spoiled scion. Awakened poppets from these lands sometimes believe themselves members of the aristocracy and can be snooty.</p><p>In nations such as Nex, Osirion, and Katapesh, where magic flows freely, construct servitors are common. As many people expect to see familiars and homunculi in their daily routines, a busy poppet rarely draws much attention. Such poppets are assumed to be on tasks for powerful masters, but they don't command too much respect-after all, if the task were truly important, the master wouldn't have sent a simple poppet. Poppets in these regions can expect to have to wait in lines, pester trade workers to get their attention, or barter like anyone else. They also tend to have simple and functional appearances with few ornamentations and a tendency to look shabby from years of work. Thus, poppets from these lands have a deeper understanding of common folk from spending so much time shoulder to shoulder (or, more likely, shoulder to thigh) among them.</p><p>Some poppets originate from crafted sophistication more so than magical skill. They might be cunning clockworks with interlocking piston-powered gears or simply wood and wicker with ingenious hinges and well-calibrated mechanisms inside. Others might look like toy soldiers or have visages of smooth, thin metal. Such poppets are most common in Alkenstar, Numeria, or around Absalom's Clockwork Cathedral. They often worry about rust, grit, or water spoiling their inner workings, to the point of being fussy.</p><p>There are few areas where poppets are outright feared, but Ustalav is one of them. Whispered stories of ghosts or curses tell tales of common objects, or even toys, given dread animation to inflict misery on a household, making citizens highly suspicious of poppets. This belief is unfortunate because Ustalav has more than its share of the creatures; eccentric inventors, professors desperate to prove abstruse theories, and possessing spirits from beyond the grave might give a poppet the spark of life. These poppets learn caution quickly, lest they be thrown into a bonfire or lake.</p><p>Because they're made from fragile materials, most poppets don't last very long before breaking down. A few rare exceptions survive from powerful ancient empires with well-known mastery of constructs, such as the Azlanti Empire or the Jistka Imperium. These poppets might be incredibly old-older than they'll ever know, as such poppets awakened recently within an ancient ruin usually have no solid recollections of their creators or their original purpose. These poppets pose perhaps the deepest mysteries, as they might hold the keys to unlock secrets of lost civilizations.</p><h2>Poppet Origins</h2><p>It's rare to find two poppets that look alike, but the most significant and defining characteristic of a poppet isn't what they're made of. Rather, it's how they were imbued with life and independent thought. Magic animates most poppets, and those awakened gain their spark of life and sentience when something goes slightly off-kilter with their enchantment. For unknown reasons-perhaps an accident or a creator's errant tinkering-a spark of life explodes into being, and a formerly lifeless series of nested commands and calculations synthesize together as true thought. The poppet suddenly gains life and self-awareness, the ability to speak and reason, and a desire for freedom.</p><p>In some cases, a poppet's life essence originally belonged to another being. An errant fragment of a departed soul, psychic impression, or similar ephemeral sliver lodges within the little construct, and the poppet's magic fashions an entirely unique personality around it. A poppet awakened this way might have occasional glimpses into the being who donated this essence, but their life, mind, and soul are thereafter their own.</p><p>The rarest, and perhaps most precious, poppets are brought to life with love. These are faithful assistants or beloved toys that someone earnestly, honestly wished would become \"real.\" There's more magic in the world than found in formulas and litanies, and this wish magic awakens poppets in the best of circumstances: knowing they're cherished and able to respond with love of their own.</p><h2>Poppet Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Charisma, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Dexterity</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

                "content": "<p>Ysoki are beings that most surface-dwelling humanoids refer to as \"ratfolk.\" They are a communal people who prefer cramped conditions, with up to 100 individuals living in a given home. If they can't find homes in town, ratfolk may instead live in caves and cavern complexes, as these provide great storage for the many and varied goods they bring back from trading expeditions.</p><p>Ratfolk love to travel, and they can often be found on the road in merchant caravans. They're good with their hands and have a keen eye for spotting anything out of the ordinary, from threats to treasures. They're also inveterate hoarders; ysoki warrens are crammed full of unusual odds and ends gathered by previous generations and stowed away in preparation for some future emergency.</p><p>If you want a character who is smart, fast, welltraveled, and adaptable, try playing a ratfolk!</p><h2>You might...</h2><ul><li>Have pride in your large extended family, and stay in contact with everyone in it.</li><li><p>Like to travel near and far in search of new experiences, likely collecting trinkets along the way</p></li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Are surprised by your careful grooming and other fastidious habits.</li><li><p>Think you're crowding them and invading their personal space.</p></li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Ratfolk have whiskered snouts, large ears, and hairless tails, and typically have red eyes and short brown or black fur. A common ratfolk is 4 feet tall and weighs around 80 pounds. Ratfolk vary considerably, however; even a single family group can exhibit substantial variation in hair color, eye color, or size.</p><p>Instinct drives ratfolk to maintain cleanliness, though this is also reinforced through their strong social structures. Because their appearance is often considered disturbing by other humanoids—and people may even mistake them for wererats—ratfolk often conceal their physical features with layers of clothing when moving through spaces dominated by other ancestries.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Ysoki culture values cooperation and community. Every ratfolk learns—through communal games, social occasions, and sports—to forge fast friendships and connections with ratfolk outside their family. With a long tradition of working as traders and tinkers, ratfolk travel frequently from one town to another. Their wagons are usually grouped into caravans of up to half a dozen vehicles. Ysoki wagons are pulled by exceptionally large giant rats, and many ratfolk can speak to such animals.</p><p>Every ysoki family has perhaps two dozen names that have been passed down from generation to generation, sometimes with minor alterations or alternative nicknames. Ratfolk are often assigned nicknames and sobriquets by humanoids they interact with, but most find these names distasteful and endure them only when outside their communities.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Barnan, Chikis, Chonan, Deto, Jass, Jix, Knagi, Kubi, Lolo, Ninnec, Nos, Rak, Renzi, Skigim, Tali, Zess</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Ratfolk care more about their family than abstract concepts of good and evil. Their warrens might be chaotic dens filled with hoarded knickknacks, but they also obey strict social codes.</p><p>Though ratfolk revere their ancestors and tend to acknowledge whatever deity is prevalent in their local area, Lao Shu Po has a special role in ysoki culture. Grandmother Rat embodies many things that are otherwise antithetical to ratfolk—she urges followers to put their own interests above others. To most ratfolk, Grandmother Rat accomplishes all those things they need done, but which they would not wish to do.</p><h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4><p>put your community's interests above your own, maintain a cleanly appearance, be honest in your dealings</p><h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4><p>throw away something that might be useful</p><h2>Ratfolk Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Ysoki, Common</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Their fascination with collecting and protecting esoteric knowledge is one of the few things that can persuade them to explore the outside world.</em></p><hr /><p>Shisks rarely encounter other peoples, even in the Mwangi Expanse. Shisks subsist on low-calorie diets of vegetables and insects, causing them to rarely compete with others for resources or seek out people to trade. They have a tight-knit society, wary of outsiders, though they don't outright attack visitors. Their history is passed down verbally and musically, and they rarely maintain written records in order to keep their knowledge safe. Often the only proof that shisks exist comes from explorers finding signs of their architecture: organic and low-impact adobe buildings carved out of mountains rather than built atop them.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>See yourself as a part of nature and avoid taking anything you don't need.</li><li>Be wary of others getting one over on you by tricking you into revealing something.</li><li>Love warmth and enjoy sunbathing despite your subterranean nature.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Are concerned by your diet and how little you eat.</li><li>Become confused or annoyed by your refusal to give information freely.</li><li>Appreciate your incredible memory and knowledge.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Shisks have features and skin-tones similar to humans, usually ranging from deep tan to deep black. They are lighter than their body size might indicate, due to having hollow bones. Shisks have no body hair-instead, their backs are covered in vestigial plumage that now grow only as bony quills that resemble calcified pin feathers. Though shisks can't fly, these spines are longer around their arms, as if they once had wings. A shisk's eyes contract into slits in the sunlight and are typically warmly colored, from hazel and brown to more unique colors like red or amber. Shisks have two prominent narrow fangs as the front teeth on their upper jaw, causing some people to mistake them for asanbosams or vampires.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Though rarely encountered, shisks are willing to speak, host, and trade with outsiders. Their economy might be confusing to others: they greatly eschew materialism in favor of information and the arts. They freely give away material goods for knowledge or even performances, considering themselves on the “winning” side of a bargain if people are willing to take material things in exchange for valuable information. They never give away information for material goods, only for other knowledge, and they rarely ask for material goods in trades.</p><p>Shisk are so paranoid that different communities of shisks have been known to clash with one another over secrets. Wars are fought not over territory or resources, but over coveted information. On a few occasions, when shisk sages or diplomats convinced different groups of shisks to put aside their differences and collaborate, great puzzles and mysteries of Golarion have been solved in a matter of hours.</p><p>Shisk clothing is loose and breathable, and often minimal to avoid catching on their bony feathers. Due to their society's disregard for materialism, the shisk live in great harmony with nature around them, taking only what they need. Shisk often take up simple hobbies, such as sunbathing.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Seeing themselves as part of the natural world and typically focused on their own pursuits instead of society, most shisks adopt neutral alignments. Some shisks are patrons of gods that have been long forgotten. Many shisks worship the sun god Chohar, a fact which might seem odd for people who dwell underground. The Green Faith is highly common among shisks, but when seeking out personal gods to revere, most shisks prefer gods of knowledge and secrets such as Irez, Nethys, or Norgorber.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Shisk names are usually granted by their parents, though these names often have secret meanings known only to their families.

However, their sheer perseverance, incredible work ethic, and resourceful use of diplomacy make shoonies far from helpless.</em></p><hr /><p>According to shoonies, Aroden created their kind to provide him with pleasant company soon after he created the Isle of Kortos. Shoony culture is rooted in this myth and its implications, which help to explain the ancestry's long reputation for hospitality, good will, and pacifism. War is antithetical to the shoony way of life; shoonies rely on cooperation and persistence to make their way through a world that can seem at times hellbent on destroying them. Shoonies are unflappable in their optimism and always see the best in others, even when faced with frequent subjugation and exploitation that might create bitterness or xenophobia among other societies. To shoonies, peace is a goal always worth striving for, and no villain is beyond redemption, so they aim to resolve problems with peaceful solutions.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Fight to protect those you care about and strive to do the right thing.</li><li>Work hard for long hours in a focused pursuit of distant goals.</li><li>Provide comfort, necessities such as food, and a sense of kinship to those in distress.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Involuntarily fawn over (or recoil from) your physical appearance.</li><li>Protect you from scary situations or terrifying phenomena, out of either friendship or overprotectiveness.</li><li>Appreciate your pragmatism and natural ability to care for others.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Shoonies are squat, furry humanoids with flattened canid faces and wet, black eyes. Their fur can be a variety of hues and patterns, with the most common colors being fawn or black, and their loose skin gives even the fittest shoony a pudgy appearance. Shoonies have short, curly tails that sometimes wag involuntarily when the shoony is content or particularly excited or pleased. Like canines, shoonies cannot sweat; they pant to mitigate heat and exertion, and it is not uncommon to see a shoony with a perpetually lolling tongue.</p><p>A shoony reaches maturity after just 8 to 10 years, and the elders of their villages rarely reach the age of 50. Little differentiates male and female shoonies except during the late stages of pregnancy, and as they age, both sexes develop graying facial fur, wrinkled skin, and frail joints. The average shoony is 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Despite the shoony drive toward communal living, most shoony settlements are farming villages with populations of no more than a hundred. Shoonies work hard to make their lands bountiful and recognize that large, dense populations can negatively affect the ecosystem. Monster attacks, natural disasters, and exploitation from stronger cultures have all also limited the spread of shoonies across the Inner Sea region.</p><p>Despite their short lifespans, shoonies are happy-go-lucky people with an irrepressible love for the land and their fellow shoonies, and remain optimistic even under the worst circumstances. The simple pleasures of living on this beautiful world, engaging in hard work, and surrounding themselves with loved ones motivate shoonies to push through the hardships that all too often befall their people.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Most shoony societies encourage empathy and loyalty, so they're rarely evil, but they're also practical, traditional, and timid. Most shoony adventurers are neutral good or lawful good. Religion is a cornerstone of shoony village life; shoonies primarily worshipped Aroden until his apparent death. In his absence, many shoonies have adopted Erastil as their patron deity because his emphasis on family, community, and living off the land naturally meshes with typical shoony values. Noble shoonies-especially warriors-sometimes look to Iomedae as an exemplar of integrity, hard work, and sacrifice.</p><h2>Adventurers</h2><p>Few shoonies willingly choose to leave their homeland and friends in favor of facing the unknown, and the circumstances that lead a shoony to adventure are often dramatic and life-altering, if not tragic. That said, some shoonies do travel the world in search of riches to bring back to their village or to avenge their kinfolk, and shoony adventurers who show bravery or ingenuity are sure to earn a place in the legends of their people.</p><p>Typical shoonies have the acolyte, farmhand, hunter, laborer, or warrior backgrounds, or the animal wrangler or rigger backgrounds. Many shoony adventurers are fighters who hone their skills to become stalwart defenders of their friends. Some shoonies pursue religious study and become clerics or champions, while others develop their foraging and hunting skills as talented druids and rangers.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>With their strong family values and emphasis on found friends, it's no wonder that shoonies take particular pride in naming their children after other loved ones. Shoony names are short, guttural, and often sound like loose strings of unassociated vowels and soft consonants to people of other ancestries. Shoonies value names and take great care to learn and speak the correct pronunciations of their friends' names.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Ahogo, Arnbin, Bighmor, Bondin, Domwurd, Ebmeur, Gopor, Gurna, Hiemgur, Mufurlo, Oriog, Pulumar, Raliamar, Ruggion, Uhulrig, Ungrin.</p><h2>Shoony Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Charisma, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Constitution</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Shoony</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

                "content": "<p><em>Skeletons are considered among the lowest types of undead. They're typically mindless creatures, lacking many of the abilities that make other undead a serious threat. However, the animated bones of dragons, giants, and other great beasts make for dangerous foes. Powerful living creatures can retain some of their might and intellect upon returning as a skeleton. Some necromancers turn their strongest enemies into skeletal undead servants, assuming they can keep control of them.</em></p><hr /><p>Skeleton adventurers were usually skilled and powerful in their former lives. Through unremitting force of will or extraordinary circumstances, their ego and ideals persist even in death. However, the very act of rising as a skeletal undead is traumatic. Memories of one's former life are usually fractured or hazy, if anything can be remembered at all. For some, these memories return with time; for others, they're gone forever. For the most part, this comes down to how the skeleton views themself: either as a continuation of the person they once were, or an entirely new being.</p><p>Skeleton adventurers often set themselves apart from other skeletons by dressing as flamboyantly as their station allows. Large, feathered caps, ornate armor, embroidered silks, or glittering jewelry are likely staples of their wardrobe. Some carve intricate \"tattoos\" into their bones or paint their skulls to maintain a sense of self that simple skeletons lack, and to signal to the living they're not like other undead.</p><p>Skeleton adventurers must come to terms with their new identity. They aren't bound by the limitations of the living and are often underestimated.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Work harder than most to prove you're a capable and distinct individual.</li><li>Wade into danger with little regard for the safety of your undead body.</li><li>Desperately seek the acceptance of the society you once moved through with ease.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Assume you're the servant of a necromancer, working to advance their agenda.</li><li>Have difficulty empathizing with you.</li><li>Regard your undeath with either pity or envy.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Aside from their complete lack of flesh and organs, skeletons vary widely in appearance, reflecting the broad diversity of all living beings. They can be tall, short, or anywhere in between. Skeletons of creatures with horns, wings, or tails retain them, although they are usually useless in their skeletal state. Skeletons raised from fresh remains tend to have stark white bones, while older ones tend to be gray or yellowed. Skeletons who adventure for a while often possess faint lines crisscrossing their bones like scars, indicating where they were injured in previous battles.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Across Golarion, intelligent skeletons rarely gather in large enough numbers to constitute any kind of settlement. Even in Geb, where their numbers are highest, they typically mingle with other undead rather than band together. Many skeletons would rather keep company with those who remind them of their former life (although such reminders can just as easily lead to revulsion derived by the void energy infused within them). Gebbite skeletons are usually treated as members of the servant class and rarely have any upward social mobility.</p><p>Outside Geb, skeletons are far more solitary. Some might hide on the outskirts of society or move about in disguise, but it's difficult for them to find acceptance among the living. While they may not be feared in places like Nidal or Sekamina, they're also not likely to be respected.</p><h2>Alignment and religion</h2><p>While undead are almost always evil, some intelligent skeletons manage to stave off the corruption of the void energy that powers them. Other than the tendency to become twisted toward evil over time, skeletons typically lean toward the alignments of their creators or their former selves. Skeletons without any particular loyalty or allegiance trend toward neutral evil alignment, or neutral if they can stave off evil.</p><p>Skeletons who embrace their undeath often worship gods of death, such as Urgathoa, while those who resent it typically look toward gods of life and redemption. Accepting deities without particularly zealous anti-undead dogma, such as Shelyn, are popular among those who wish to fight against their destructive influences and become something greater than the purpose for which they were created.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>No widespread naming convention exists for skeletons. When necromancers bother to name skeletons they've raised, they typically choose names that suit their own tastes, the way one would name a pet. Others might be named for their role or job. Skeletons with their memories intact might choose to keep their name from when they were alive, but others might choose new names based on their undead experiences.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Clatterjaw, Creaker, Doorstop, Final Sacrifice, Gochiyo, Lectern, Macefodder, Sixth Lancer, Skulldyr, Xelim</p><h2>Skeleton Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Charisma, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Intelligence</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Necril</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

They love playing pranks, exploring new things, and embracing everything to do with magic.</em></p><hr /><p>When most people picture a fey, chances are they're thinking of a sprite. The majority of sprites remain in the First World, where they are essentially immortal, reincarnating to a new form of fey when their life eventually comes to an end. Some even meld together with others to form a more substantial body or split apart into multiple smaller fey. However, sprites are incredibly curious about all forms of magic, leading a significant number to risk the mortal world to explore the new possibilities offered by the unusually static nature of mortal existence. These creatures mix in with other, smaller groups of Material Plane comrades, including exiles from the First World, those whose family swore pacts to mortals, and even contemplative individuals curious to enter the mortal cycle of souls.</p><p>The first generation of Material Plane sprites were content to guard magical locations or objects, learn music, and play pranks on the unsuspecting. Panic struck when children born in the mortal world didn't form wings upon adulthood-some sprites transitioning to the mortal world likewise lost their wings after a time. Believing this to be a sign that the mortal world was too alien for them to live there, many of the initial sprite explorers returned to the safety of the First World.</p><p>However, their wingless children exhibited a potential unmatched by any of their ancestors, as well as a particular magical affinity for the mortal world. They became the mightiest of sprite heroes, but also, on occasion, the most dangerous villains. As they came close to reaching their full strength, many of them did grow their wings at long last: larger, unique, and more vibrant than any from the First World had seen before, a sign of their limitless potential.</p><p>If you want a character who is tiny, mercurial, and curious, you should play a sprite.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Play good-natured pranks on those around you, intended to teach a lesson, aid in locating a lost item, or even help find love.</li><li>Become sidetracked by something new and eye-catching before you have fully followed through on your previous plan.</li><li>Find something magical that's so important to you, you can't help but protect it with every ounce of your strength.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Expect you to know strange fey mysteries and perform fantastical primal magic well beyond your actual abilities.</li><li>Consider you the prime suspect whenever unexplained hijinks or serendipity comes their way.</li><li>Misconstrue the way your mind works, seeing your flitting attention as a sign of being scatterbrained.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Sprites are tiny faeries whose features vary wildly based on their heritage. The Wingless-those with the potential to become powerful heroes and villains, including all PC sprites-slowly grow their wings over time as their magical potential manifests, though some never grow wings at all. Those sprites with humbler destinies typically grow wings when reaching full adulthood and mastering their innate magic. Sprites reach adulthood at around the same rate as humans do, but a typical fey who can manage to stay out of mischief and danger can live 1,000 years or more. Material Plane sprites who sense their time is coming to an end usually return to the First World to be reborn and start their adventure all over again.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Sprites habitually live in tiny, reclusive villages in areas with abundant magic, natural beauty, or other curiosities of interest. Other sprites live as loners or with small family or peer groups, traveling across the land in search of excitement.</p><h2>Alignments and Religion</h2><p>Sprites run the gamut of alignments but are rarely lawful or evil. They are far more likely to worship the Eldest-the peculiar deities of the fey-than those of the mortal world. They have a particular affinity for Shyka, the many-formed Eldest of time, and the Lantern King, the trickster among their ranks. Among mortal deities, sprites appreciate Desna the most, and due to her iconic depiction as a butterfly-winged woman, some Desnan sprites claim her as one of their own. Sprites also readily comprehend the doctrines of Cayden Cailean and Shelyn, and the goddess of beauty and art is a particular favorite among grigs.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Sprite names are based entirely on their parents' whimsy. Sprites often adopt additional monikers later in life or change those assigned to them at birth; this is neither frowned upon nor considered abnormal.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Bree, Plumgrass, Cowrie, Flit, Moth, Zephyr, Naatalu, Pinebrush, Zandivar</p><h2>Sprite Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Tiny</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Strength</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Sylvan</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

With an average height of 6 feet, strix are taller than most humans but are very light for their size. Strix are considered mature at 14 years of age and have an average lifespan of 40 years. They have pointed ears and large eyes that are typically black from sclera to pupil, but occasionally appear as a piercing golden color. Strix lack the ability to move their eyes independently of their head, resulting in distinctive jerky movements as their gaze snaps between targets. Their bodies are usually taut with defined musculature-a result of the strength necessary to flex their wings.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Strix are rare and reclusive people who cling to their ancestral territories. They live in modest-sized tribes, but some reside in smaller bands of tight-knit individuals. The largest settlements of strix reside on Devil's Perch, but a small number of their ilk have traveled far across Golarion. Strix feel an intense empathy and attachment to their family and other community members. They prioritize the needs of their community over their individual desires, and their bands and tribes benefit from an easy yet expertly organized division of labor. Strix tribes are led by a rokoa, a female tribal leader.</p><p>A long history of conflict with the nearby nation of Cheliax as bred into most strix a deep fear and suspicion of humans-who they call kotaara. Strix have struggled to keep hold of their territories and maintain their numbers in the face of constant conflict with these enemies who, in addition to trying to destroy what they believe to be winged devils, vastly outnumber them. Due to their strongly bonded groups, the loss of a single tribe member is devastating.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Due to their deep respect for the rules of a functioning society, strix are rarely chaotic, but some may be flexible on adopting the rules of outside societies. Strix are typically nonreligious and instead use stories from an epic known as the Korrsat Akra, or “The Scattered Nest,” to tell them of their origins and give them direction on their current place in the world. They have a deep investment in the lives of their fellows and experience intense grief at their passing. Pharasma is a common influence among religious strix due to the popularity of religious and spiritual practices honoring the lives and deaths in their beloved community. Gozreh is also an everyday influence for many strix, who beseech the Wind and the Waves to give them satisfying tailwinds for flight and protect their kin when the sky turns dark with fury. Erastil and even Torag represent two versions of social order and may be unifying deities across entire tribes.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Strix names consist of sounds that are reminiscent of chirping, screeches, or trilling by various birds, and their naming conventions are influenced primarily by tradition and spirituality. Strix in small communities might share a common syllable among all their names to express their unity. Due to their deep affection for their family members, naming children after other loved ones is very common, occasionally with an additional syllable or slight change to the pronunciation.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Chiit-iir, Cicreeti, Ikatarii, Irkoata, Kaata, Kiilo, Kirii, Rahka, Roatatwiil, Turiilo, Turuk, Twilii</p><h2>Strix Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Free</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Strix</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

                "content": "<p>Surkis are an insectile species who subsist on the latent magic in the world around them. As a subterranean species native to the Darklands, surkis have rarely been seen on the surface, and always with long pauses between historical sightings. This is due to surkis' life cycle—long dormancies followed by so-called \"generation digs,\" as they migrate great distances in response to happenings underground. The healing of the Worldwound initiated one of the largest such digs in their history, bringing surkis up into the caverns and passages of the Sarkoris Scar and emerging onto the surface for the first time in many years. Since their emergence, several small surki settlements have been established in secluded corners of Sarkoris, voraciously cataloging the wildlife, magics, and various other inhabitants of the area as they explore the alien environment of the surface.</p><p>Rather than consuming food conventionally, surkis are filter feeders, absorbing magic from the air, soil, plants, stone, and practically any other material. This magic is refined and sequestered in nodes throughout a surki's body over the course of their life cycle, which is comprised of three distinct phases: larva, adult, and evolved. At each stage, surkis use their stockpiled magic to undergo a dramatic metamorphosis into their next stage of life, evolving adaptations that will help them survive in any environment. Surkis therefore vary dramatically on an individual level; each surki tells the story of their adventures and their chosen role in the environment in their unique combination of adaptations.</p><p>If you want to play a character who's exploring Golarion for the first time, with limitless adaptability and a strong tie to magic, you should play a surki.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Feel a very strong connection to the world around you, sensing the latent magic in everything.</li><li>Be driven to travel far or learn as much as you can about your home.</li><li>Pay particular attention to the way others live in environments unfamiliar to you.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Mistake your individuality and excitement for your adaptations as boastful pride.</li><li>Find your excitement for new people, places, and things endearing and inspirational.</li><li>Trust your magical senses over their own maps in tight situations.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Each of surkis' three life stages greatly differ. Larval surkis spend the first 10 to 100 years of their lives dormant inside their eggs, waiting to emerge when they've accumulated enough latent magic and the environmental conditions are just right. Larval surkis are roughly two feet long and grub-like with several luminescent nodes visible through their translucent flesh. Their heads are chitinous, round, and eyeless, and they navigate primarily using the ability to smell magic. Four of their six legs are small, but the front set are large, powerful digging claws that they use to tunnel through the earth and to communicate with the other larvae in their generation dig as they travel from their nest home. Once they've traveled far and accumulated enough magic, they enter a cocoon for several days, emerging as the adult form that's seen most often on the surface.</p><p>Adult surkis have a roughly bipedal form, standing on two multi-jointed limbs and having two arms that end in three-fingered claws used both for digging and for producing percussive sounds used in the Surki language. They possess two feathery antennae and two long sensory barbels that sit on either side of their mandibles. Surkis have a characteristic rounded shape with several rustbrown or orange chitinous plates along their back, and surki clothing and fashion tend to incorporate rounded shapes or belts around and under their plates. Their magical nodes are distributed throughout their bodies, clustering in the abdomen, shoulders, and each limb.</p><p>These nodes continue to accumulate magic as they age, using it to create new adaptations, often heralded by intricate, luminescent patterns in the chitin surrounding the point of change.</p><p>The final stage in surkis' life cycle is known as the evolved form, after the surki enters its grand metamorphosis. An adult surki forms a chrysalis and rapidly changes over the course of a single evening. Less physically dramatic than the shift between larva and adulthood, the evolved form brings with it profound magical abilities that resulted from a lifetime of magical absorption and refinement. Evolved surkis' nodes metamorphose into complex organs capable of projecting tangible magic to a variety of ends, from digging apparatuses made out of pure force to glowing wings that defy gravity. This final form is the ultimate expression of any surki's individuality and adaptations—a form perfectly suited to fulfill the environment they choose to inhabit or the role they wish to fill.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Surki society places great importance on individuality and self-expression. Every surki is expected to find their own way of doing things, and innovation is a highly prized achievement. Surkis are also very much in touch with their environment; they place no distinction between plant and animal, recognizing that every being fills an important part of the environment. This quality has led surkis to create settlements that leave as little impact on the environment as possible, weaving silks around plants and fungi to coax them to grow into shelters and walls. Wood and other plant-based resources are seldom harvested in a manner considered traditional to most societies in Golarion. These resources are portioned out in strategically grown sections and harvested precisely enough to not kill the plant if possible.</p><p>Surki relationships are focused on complementing adaptations. Surkis are generally polyamorous and might maintain a close bond with numerous others. Surkis are a single-sex species, and while they understand concepts of gender and orientation as experienced by other ancestries, many surkis find the idea of choosing not to bond with someone based on anatomy or personal descriptions absurd. They instead choose to pursue those with personalities, talents, or adaptations that augment their own in unexpected ways, such as using woven silks to reinforce a tunnel dug through loose rock. Nevertheless, attraction in surki society is as complicated an idea as in any other, and bonded surkis will often express their feelings toward a loved one with a personal description that expresses something they value within the relationship. For example, a surki might introduce a partner as \"Who Speaks Quietly and Makes My Soil Richer.\"</p><p>Only adult surkis are capable of reproducing, which they do through parthenogenesis. Any adult surki can lay an egg when they choose, though because the process expends so much of the magic stored in their nodes, few surkis lay more than one egg every few years. Many of these eggs are kept in a protected area of the settlement, awaiting the next generation dig. When the eggs are ready, they hatch en masse, and the larva coordinate their departure, drawn to magic like a beacon tunneling through the earth and stone to find a new place to settle.</p><p>Familial life vastly differs for surkis. Eggs lain outside of a generation dig are cared for and tended by the surki \"parent\" until the grub emerges. New village grubs are typically left to their own devices, allowed to venture outside the village or even leave the community altogether. Often, village grubs find their first homes in the soil of the community farms, where they feed on the natural magic within the soil and plant life. These gardens double as schools for these grubs, as the adult and evolved surkis who tend the gardens regularly converse with the grubs, thumping and scraping out the stories of their young lives and the lessons they've learned from others. Surki grubs born early or those whose nodes don't function well are often bonded with ostillis, small amorphous symbiotes that augment the grubs' ability to absorb nutrients from magic.</p><p>Surkis choose their names when they enter adolescence. Every surki has a name referred to as their \"root\" or \"grub\" name that's produced solely with the forelimbs. Adults commonly incorporate all or part of their root name preceding their chosen name, though it isn't expected to be repeated, especially by those of other ancestries who don't possess the exoskeleton necessary to \"pronounce\" the name. The root name, while shown proudly, is considered the personal property of the surki who possesses it, and repetition of the root portion of a surki's name is considered rude by most, tantamount to theft. Surkis' chosen names typically represent a personal quality that they admire most or an achievement they take pride in. As surkis age, they might change their chosen name to better fit who they feel they've become. When surkis die, any present-tense verbs used in their names become past tense.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Bearer of Heavy Boulders, Weaver of Intricate Webs, With the Deftest Song, Who Shines Brightly, Whose Patterns are Bold, Whose Voice is Music</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Surkis' connection to their environment leads them to typically worship natural deities. Their own ancient traditions identify each creature as possessing a unique spirit, with keystone species occupying a deific role within their ecosystem. Surki traditions dictate that surkis and other cultures aren't part of this spirit cycle, though with time, care, and practice, one can be accepted into it with the blessing of the environment's keystone species.</p><p>Among surki communities in Sarkoris, worship of Gozreh and Sturovenen has grown quickly. Surkis who dedicate themselves to a deity are more likely to choose one representing their own environment or the natural world as a whole. Deities whose domains include travel or change are also popular among surki devotees.</p><p>It's very important to surkis that life be allowed to follow its natural course. Death, violence, and war all have their place and purpose.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p><p>encourage others to discover their true selves, protect and nurture natural ecosystems, work with others to promote symbiotic relationships</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p><p>force another to change before they're ready</p><h2>Surki Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Free</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Surki, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Their handlike feet and agile builds serve them well in the jungle realms where most vanaras live.</p><p>Vanaras were born of the monkey god Ragdya's ambitious folly ages ago, to spread and applaud his mischief and to serve as ba-sadhak, blessed seekers of fortune who would draw their creator's eye to the cruelly hoarded treasure of mortal lords and immortal fiends. They earned the enmity of ancient rakshasa maharajahs for their derring-do, the scorn of the naga empire for their valor, and the friendship of many rural Vudrani who viewed them as a wild folk of deep divine portent. Such is the history of vanaras and their long survival against their many foes, from within the mahajanapadas of the deep jungle lands, the mountain ghats of Vudra, and the Impossible Lands. If you want to play a character who embodies the struggle between self-betterment and self-expression, you should play a vanara.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Find it difficult to avoid pursuing a mystery or exploring a hidden area.</li><li>Thoughtfully consider the consequences of your pranks or actions.</li><li>Enjoy sharing the knowledge of things you've discovered with your friends.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Assume you have an animalistic demeanor and habits.</li><li>Take a dismissive or hostile view of your pranks.</li><li>Covet your easy grace and unquenchable curiosity.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Vanaras are humanoids with simian features, including a long, prehensile tail and handlike feet. They're rarely much taller than 5 feet, but they usually look smaller because of their slight, nimble builds. Vanaras are covered with a thin layer of soft fur over their entire bodies. This fur can be tan, brown, or golden and rarely has spots or stripes. The hair on a vanara's head grows thicker and more luxurious; it's easy to arrange into elaborate hairstyles, and many vanaras like to do so. This hair is nearly always of the same color as the vanara's body fur, with the exception of rare \"whitecape\" vanaras with manes of fine, pale hair, who might be born into any vanara family. Vanaras have large, expressive eyes and mouths with blunt teeth and pointed incisors. Vanaras are adults at 13 years old and usually live about 60 years.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Vanaras are a varied folk who seek balance and comfort in their lives. Many are devout without being fanatics, tricksters without being malicious, daring without being foolish, and curious without being obsessive. Although aware of their deep ancestral connection to Ragdya, many vanaras feel a powerful desire to live beyond the grace of their god and his weight in their history, pursuing their own paths to enlightenment. Those vanaras who live in Vudra feel this need the most strongly, as they want to pursue virtue and self-knowledge to be fulfilled when their souls are next reborn into the world.</p><p>Although created by Ragdya, vanaras feel themselves apart from him in a way some find uncomfortable. Ragdya is the eternal trickster with supreme recklessness yet unchanging in his immortal permanence. Though most vanaras cherish Ragdya's mischief and feats of folly on religious holidays, they also know he shall never fade from this world or find himself reincarnated into forms other than that from which the vanaras were shaped. Yet, vanaras aren't so immutable. A vanara must reflect on their own impermanent nature and consider its effect on their soul and their soul's quest for enlightenment. For all the mischief and daring Ragdya might enjoy without consequence, vanaras know recklessness and harmful tricks can impede their personal pursuit of enlightenment. The drive toward mischief and spontaneity instilled within them by their creator is hard for many vanaras to overcome and can create a lifetime of internal turmoil. This source of conflict has colored their development as a people who seek balance and virtue.</p><p>Vanaras look to the legends of heroic vanaras of the past for lessons on how to live their lives. The most notable and lauded accomplishment of these legendary vanaras, that which has them known even in the most far-flung ashram in the snow-capped border mountains of Vudra, was their grand act of trickery against Ravana, the greatest of all the rakshasa immortals. Ravana had tyrannically forced many noble souls, vanara and human alike, to construct a resplendent bridge of azure stones that would cross the planes from Vudra to the rakshasa's realm. Ravana demanded that each stone be carved to display a mewling visage of the mortal who toiled to cut and shape it. Through mischief and artifice, vanaras altered the carvings so that, when assembled, they subtly displayed components of a prayer to all the Vudrani pantheon. When the bridge was finally finished and Ravana marched across it with his army of fiends in a profligate parade, the shuddering of the stones beneath their footsteps mimicked the movements of the communal prayer. Deities drawn by this display toppled the immortal maharajah, and he still blames mischief-making vanaras for this humiliation. Many vanaras thus see it as their legacy to bring shame to the wicked and powerful by means of clever tricks and communal effort.</p><h2>Alignment and religion</h2><p>Vanaras are tricksters who love pranks, but they temper this tendency toward mischief with good intentions and a love of their community—however they personally define that community. They're rarely agitators or troublemakers simply for the sake of causing chaos; they do so to encourage humility among the inflexible or humorless. Most vanaras are mindful of the virtues necessary to elevate their immortal souls and try to act accordingly. Vanaras are thus most likely to be neutral good.</p><p>Most vanaras live in Vudra, where they're exposed to the dizzyingly abundant array of Vudran deities. Nevertheless, devout vanaras nearly always venerate Ragdya above all others. Priests of Ragdya lead most vanara villages. Even vanaras who aren't religious might call upon Ragdya to help them make wise decisions in times of danger or for guidance when an unlucky prank has caused them trouble they're unsure how to escape. Vanaras interested in developing self-control might worship Irori instead, and regions with local vanara hero-gods or avatars might engender faithful sects of worshippers on a small scale. Some vanaras revere the evil simian hunter Lahkgya, but almost never openly, as this deity of ferocious and sudden violence is unwelcome in most vanara communities. Some communities instead make offerings to turn Lahkgya's attention from them.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Newborn vanaras aren't given names other than descriptors of their infant personalities or habits, like \"Grip-Hand\" or \"Wailer.\" When they learn to speak, vanaras are given another name based on important historical or mythological figures, or they're given the name of a specific ancestor they resemble in appearance or attitude (or whom their community hopes they'll grow to resemble). The chosen name usually contains consonants or vowels the young vanara frequently uses, as vanaras don't see a lot of use in giving someone a name they can't easily pronounce.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Ashpaka, Chichipi, Haangeno, Hasa, Huanu, Kana, Nammem, Roprutu, Thathona, Unulu, Vivatu</p><h2>Vanara Heritages</h2><p>Both within and outside Vudra, vanaras have a variety of heritages.

Largely misunderstood due to old tales of their toxicity and natural finesse, vishkanyas work to grow into more than just what stories paint them to be.</p><p>The true nature of vishkanyas' origin is a matter of debate. Some vishkanyas believe they are rejected spawn of Ravithra, which explains the animosity between vishkanyas and nagas. Others believe themselves the stolen offspring of a forgotten progenitor whose name was excised from history. Regardless, one thing is quite clear: vishkanyas are survivors. Throughout history, fear of their deadly abilities forced vishkanyas to experience subjugation, exploitation, and ostracizing. Yet through it all, they endured. Now free of chains to bind them, vishkanyas live in close-knit groups, and use their love of storytelling and the arts to keep a detailed history of their people while they determine how best to proceed in a world ripe with opportunity.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Have a powerful sense of community.</li><li>Find peace and fulfillment in having a creative pursuit.</li><li>Be adept at matching the environment around you to fit into any number of diverse situations.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Initially mistake you for having a tiefling or draconic heritage.</li><li>Think you are an expert in poisons, toxins, and espionage.</li><li>Misunderstand the nature of your venom and fear physical contact.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Vishkanyas are humanlike in appearance with ophidian features that become clear in close proximity. They are naturally tall and lithe with bright golden eyes, vertical pupils, and a forked tongue. Their small, smooth scales range from earthy tones of browns and greens to bright displays of colored patterns. Hair color is typically of darker shades, though there are occasional instances of brighter colors through parts of the hair. Vishkanyan women are usually taller than the men, though neither ever truly stops growing. As such, vishkanyas can reach heights of 7 feet or taller in old age.</p><p>Mixed vishkanya families aren't unknown. Vishkanya offspring from this background sometimes strongly resemble their non-vishkanya parent, with only a few stray tells, such as sharp canine teeth, to indicate their heritage. Vishkanyas sometimes refer to these children as \"scaleless\" or \"subtle\" but otherwise welcome them as any other among their kin, though sadly their appearance can fuel paranoia among other ancestries toward a people who are already misunderstood.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Vishkanyas live in small, tight-knit communities between 50 and 100 individuals who assimilate discreetly into larger societies, with many such groups scattered within a larger area. At the head of these groups is a selection of women chosen for their wisdom and knowledge. Vishkanyas often have multiple partners, give birth in multiples, and adhere to maternal inheritances. Children are generally free to choose their occupation and the nature of their contribution to the larger community, with many vishkanyas pursuing some sort of craft or art. Some roles are burdened with the responsibility of cultural and historical record-keeping, however, and these important tasks continue across generations. Traditionally, these culturally minded vishkanyas regularly meet in secret congregations for the purpose of sharing stories, information, and resources, providing support for youth and creating advisory bodies to help make large-scale decisions for vishkanyas of a given area. The desire to preserve vishkanyan culture has kept this practice going for centuries, yet recently, some have called for more open interaction with the world in an attempt to proudly share vishkanyan culture.</p><p>Vishkanyas are often mischaracterized as indiscriminately venomous or inherently malicious by other ancestries, which has led to them having very strong concepts of their own ethnicity and their separation from those they consider \"outsiders.\" While most vishkanyas are gracious and hospitable to non-vishkanya visitors, a large stir often arises around the concept of allowing such people into their communities in a more involved capacity. Parents carefully watch any children who seem too attached to non-vishkanya friends, and talk of romance and marriage with another ancestry will inevitably provoke many a long family discussion—though not necessarily hostile ones.</p><h2>Alignment and religion</h2><p>Concerned mainly with the preservation of their communities, vishkanyas tend to adopt neutral alignments. Vishkanyas who take to individualistic travel to teach others about their ancestry, or simply to experience the world, might be neutral or chaotic good. The topic of faith can be quite different among vishkanyan groups, with some sticking to old vishkanyan beliefs, and some to Vudrani deities like Likha or Ashukharma. Other groups outside Vudra might embrace local gods with tenets of freedom or the arts, such as Arazni, Cayden Cailean, or Shelyn, or divinities more specific to individual pursuits.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Vishkanyan names often include short vowel sounds in the middle of the name, with a large number of fricative consonants pronounced most accurately with a forked tongue. Names are often chosen from momentous events in vishkanyan history or from matters related to the maternal line of the child. When they go through significant life events, vishkanyas may choose new names for themselves, and many often do so multiple times. Each name represents an important part of the individual's story—who they were, and who they have become.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Ashath, Casuthis of Guiding Hands, Enysi, Izith, Othasee, Riddle of Esaviz, Salthazar, Thasi the Ragebreaker</p><h2>Vishkanya Venom</h2><p>All vishkanya carry toxins in their veins, which manifest as follows.</p><h3>Innate Venom</h3><p>Your blood carries toxins deadly to all but yourself. You gain the Envenom action, which can deliver minor vishkanyan venom. The save DC for your venom is equal to the higher of your class DC or spell DC.</p><h2>Vishkanya Heritages</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Elusive Vishkanya]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Keen-Venom Vishkanya]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Old-Blood Vishkanya]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Prismatic Vishkanya]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Scalekeeper Vishkanya]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Venom-Resistant Vishkanya]</p>",

Other individuals are born under far stranger circumstances, such as having a parent who was affected by monstrous, undead, or extraplanar energies. As these circumstances aren't unique to a single ancestry, these heritages—called versatile heritages—are likewise shared by many ancestries.</p><p>The peoples of Golarion are many, and they have a long history of intermingling or dabbling with forces capable of altering the very fabric of a mortal body or soul. The children born to such parents might have traits from each of their parents or physiological manifestations of the forces their ancestors were influenced by, manifesting as a specific heritage.</p><h2>Versatile Heritages</h2><p>Golarion is home to a variety of versatile heritages. Some are born to unusual creatures or arise through specific mundane or supernatural circumstances. Many, however, result from an infusion of extraplanar energy, whether through direct parentage, more distant ancestors, or simply direct exposure to the quintessence of that plane. These individuals are known as planar scions.</p><p>Because the circumstances that give rise to versatile heritages aren't limited to a single ancestry, a versatile heritage can be chosen by a character of nearly any ancestry. Some versatile heritages are more common among some ancestries than others, and some might list additional restrictions specific to that heritage. Your GM may place other restrictions on which ancestries can use a given versatile heritage based on the story and setting. Unlimited Possibilities!</p><p>Though a character can have only one heritage and one lineage feat, the possible permutations of a character's background and family tree are virtually unlimited. An aiuvarin character might still have a changeling parent whose nature is visible in the coloration of their eyes even if they don't have access to changeling ancestry feats, and a pitborn dwarf might very well have an ancestor with fey influences on their bloodline, reflected with a fey muse or patron gained through their class alongside their ancestral fiendishness.</p><h2>Playing A Versatile Heritage</h2><p>To play a character with a versatile heritage, first select your ancestry, just like you would for any character. You gain Hit Points, size, Speed, attribute boosts and attribute flaws, languages, traits, and other abilities from that ancestry. Then, instead of choosing a heritage from those normally available to that ancestry, apply your chosen versatile heritage. You gain all the features from your versatile heritage, some of which might modify or replace statistics, abilities, or traits from your ancestry.</p><p>Since a versatile heritage is a heritage, you can have only one, and you can't have any other heritage in addition to your versatile heritage. Sometimes a versatile heritage might give you an ability that conflicts with an ability from your ancestry. In these cases, you choose which of the conflicting abilities your character has.</p><p>When selecting ancestry feats, you can choose from those available to your ancestry as well as those specific to your versatile heritage.</p><h2>Lineage Feats</h2><p>Some ancestry feats within a versatile heritage have the lineage trait. These feats specify a physiological lineage your character has—such as the type of hag that birthed a changeling character, or the type of extraplanar entity that influenced a nephilim's birth. You can have only one lineage feat; you can select such a feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of this feat.</p><h2>Versatile Heritages</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Aphorite]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Ardande]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Beastkin]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Changeling]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Dhampir]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Dragonblood]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Duskwalker]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Ganzi]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Naari]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Nephilim]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Oread]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Reflection]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Suli]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Sylph]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Talos]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Undine]</p><h2>Other Halves</h2><p>By default, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Aiuvarin] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Dromaar] descend from humans, but your GM might allow you to be the offspring of an elf, orc, or different ancestry.
