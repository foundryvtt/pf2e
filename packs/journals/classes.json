Some patrons are multifaceted, appearing in different guises, and granting different powers to different witches. In some cases, the witch may know of their patron's identity, but have some other aspect shrouded in uncertainty; they might know their patron's name but not motive, or perhaps even if they know the patron's identity, they have been cursed to never reveal it to others.</p><p>Your patron determines the following.</p><p><strong>Spell List</strong> You use this magical tradition and spell list;</p><p><strong>Patron Skill</strong> You become trained in the skill associated with your patron's magical tradition.</p><p><strong>Initial Lesson</strong> This is the first lesson your patron teaches you and is unique to your patron.</p><p><strong>Familiar Ability</strong> One of your familiar's two bonus abilities is always the one listed here, a mark of your patron's indelible influence.

You treat magic like a science, cross-referencing the latest texts on practical spellcraft with ancient tomes to discover and understand arcane magic. Yet magical theory is vast, and there's no way you can study it all. Most wizards learn through formal schooling, with their curriculum informing a specific rubric, although particularly driven researchers sometimes piece together their own theories.</em></p><p><strong>Key Attribute: INTELLIGENCE</strong></p><p>At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Intelligence.</p><p><strong>Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p><p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p><h1>Roleplaying the Wizard</h1><h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2><p>You likely try to stay out of the fray, carefully judging when to use your spells.

You might even forge scholarly connections and establish a school or guild of your own.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Have an unquenchable intellectual curiosity about how everything in the world around you works-magic in particular.</li><li>Believe fervently that your school of magic is superior (if you're a specialist) or that true mastery of magic requires knowledge of all schools (if you're a universalist).</li><li>Use esoteric jargon and technical terms to precisely describe the minutiae of magical effects, even though the difference is probably lost on other people.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Consider you to be incredibly powerful and potentially dangerous.</li><li>Fear what your magic can do to their minds, bodies, and souls, and ask that you avoid casting spells in polite company, as few can identify whether one of your spells is harmless or malevolent until it's too late.</li><li>Assume you can easily solve all their problems, from dangerous weather to poor crop yields, and ask you for spells that can help them get whatever they desire.</li></ul><h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1><p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

Whether you learned in the storied halls of a formal institution, via an apprenticeship with an archmage, or taught yourself from secondhand tomes, your arcane school indelibly set the curriculum and direction of your magic.</p><p><strong>Curriculum Spells:</strong> You automatically add some of the spells listed in your school's curriculum to your spellbook. At 1st level, you add a cantrip and two 1st-rank spells of your choice. As soon as you gain the ability to cast wizard spells of a new rank, choose one of the spells from your curriculum of that rank to add to your spellbook. A superscript \"U\" indicates an uncommon spell. Your GM might allow you to swap or add other spells to your curriculum if they strongly fit the theme.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots:</strong> Each day, you can prepare an extra cantrip from your curriculum. You also gain an extra spell slot at each spell rank for which you have wizard spell slots. You can prepare only spells from your school's curriculum in these extra slots. Any spell listed in your curriculum of a suitable spell rank is eligible to be prepared in each of these extra slots, regardless of how you added the spell to your spellbook.</p><p><strong>School Spells:</strong> School spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to study your spellbook or conduct arcane research.</p><p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points.</p><p>You learn the initial school spell, which is unique to your school. You can learn the advanced school spell with the Advanced School Spell feat.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Ars Grammatica]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Battle Magic]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of the Boundary]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Civic Wizardry]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Mentalism]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Protean Form]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Unified Magical Theory]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Red Mantis Magic School]</p><p></p>",
