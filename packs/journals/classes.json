These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p><h2>Muses</h2><p>As a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads you to great things, and might be a physical creature, a deity, a philosophy, or a captivating mystery.</p><p>Muses can be found here: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Maestro], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Polymath], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Enigma], and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Warrior].</p><h2>Bard Spellcasting</h2><p>You draw upon magic from esoteric knowledge. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the occult tradition using the Cast a Spell activity.</p><p>As a bard, when you cast spells, your incantations might be musical riffs or clever limericks, your gestures might incorporate dance and dramatic pantomiming, and you might accompany your spellcasting by playing a musical instrument.</p><p>Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p><p>As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Bard Spells per Day table.</p><p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p><h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded upâ€”this is usually equal to the highest rank of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells</p><table class=\"pf2e remaster\"><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#002a17;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The magnum opus class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Spell Repertoire</h2><p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank occult spells of your choice and five occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.</p><p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3-6), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p><p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p><h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3><p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p><h2>Bard Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a bard class feat.</p><h2>Skill Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.

This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain ranks.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest rank of spell you can cast as a magus. For example, as a 1st-level magus, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level magus, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><h3>Spellbook</h3><p>Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of eight arcane cantrips and four 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be anything from a sturdy book with a secure latch entitled Theses on the Stratagems of Supernatural Warfare to a tattered collection of training pamphlets with your name scrawled on the cover.</p><p>Each time you gain a level, you add two more arcane spells to your spellbook, of any rank of spell you can cast. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures. Though you lose some lower spell slots as you increase in level, you keep the spells in your spellbook and can prepare them in your higher-rank slots as normal.</p><p>If you have a spellbook from multiple sources (such as being a magus with the Wizard Dedication feat), you can use the same spellbook for all your spells.</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-*</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-*</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-*</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-*</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-*</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-*</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-*</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-*</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-*</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-*</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-*</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-*</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The studious spells class feature gives you extra slots of this rank for specific spells.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Spellstrike</h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.KVj5ofUwu3VJSrVw inline hr=false]</p><h2>Arcane Cascade</h2><p>After you wield magic, you can enter a special stance to make your attacks more effective.</p><h2>Hybrid Study</h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.FTeIs1Z1Qeli4BIF inline hr=false]</p><h2>Conflux Spells</h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.FkbFgmoVz5lHhSMo inline hr=false]</p><h2>Magus Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a magus class feat.</p><h2>Skill Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.

At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p><p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></p><p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. You can also instead swap a cantrip.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p><h2>Psychic Spellcasting</h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.iXwqJyBsjJNrKJae inline hr=false]</p><h2>Spell Repertoire</h2><p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-rank occult spell of your choice and three occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. Your choice of conscious mind also grants you additional spells in your repertoire, starting with an additional 1st-rank spell and two cantrips listed in your conscious mind, which you cast as psi cantrips (see below).</p><p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-rank spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell. Your conscious mind also adds additional spells to your repertoire as you gain spells of higher ranks.</p><p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, such as the spells you gain from your conscious mind, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p><h3><strong>Swapping Spells in your Repertoire</strong></h3><p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><caption>Psychic Spells per Day</caption><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>3*</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1â€ </td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2â€ </td></tr><tr><td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\"><p>* Your conscious mind gives you three additional cantrips with amps.

You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity. The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell.</p><p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p><p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table.</p><p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier.</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded upâ€”this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><h2>Spell Repertoire</h2><p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.</p><p>Each time you get a spell slot (see the Sorcerer Spells per Day table above), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. When you gain a new rank of spells, your first new spell is always the sorcerous gift spell for that rank that's listed in your bloodline, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p><p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot or vice versa.</p><h3>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</h3><p>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Bloodline Spells</h2><p>Your bloodline grants you bloodline spells, special spells unique to your lineage. Bloodline spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don't need to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.</p><p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules can be found here.</p><h2>Sorcerous Potency</h2><p>Because of the magical power inherent in your blood, your spells that hurt or cure are stronger than those of other spellcasters. When you Cast a Spell from your spell slots that either deals damage or restores Hit Points, you gain a status bonus to that spell's damage or healing equal to the spell's rank. This applies only to the initial damage or healing the spell deals when cast. An individual creature takes this damage or benefits from this healing only once per spell, even if the spell would damage or heal that creature multiple times.</p><h2>Skill Feats Level 2</h2><p>Level 2</p><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p><h2>Sorcerer Feats Level 2</h2><p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a sorcerer class feat.</p><h2 class=\"title\">General Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Signature Spells <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>Your innate power allows you to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p><p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Magical Fortitude <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Expert Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to expert.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Reflex Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2><p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Perception Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>You've improved your combat skill. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Defensive Robes <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>The flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>You've learned to inflict grave wounds with your most practiced weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Master Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>You have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to master.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Majestic Will<br /> <span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2><p>Your mind and will are tempered by your mastery of magical forces. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Bloodline Paragon <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-rank spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, and they can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Bloodline Perfection] sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Legendary Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>You demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to legendary.</p><h1>Bloodlines</h1><p>Your bloodline determines your spell list, the tradition of spells you cast, and grants you access to two trained skills.</p><h2>Bloodline Spells</h2><p>Your bloodline grants you bloodline spells, special spells unique to your lineage. Bloodline spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don't need to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.</p><p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots; you can't cast them using spell slots. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points.</p><p>You learn the initial bloodline spell, which is unique to your bloodline.</p><h2>Reading a Bloodline Entry</h2><p>A bloodline entry contains the following information.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Tradition</strong> You use this magical tradition and spell list; <strong>Bloodline</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Skills</strong> You become trained in the listed skills.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Sorcerous Gifts</strong> You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, as described in the Spell Repertoire. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a 1st-rank spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that rank.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bloodline Spells</strong> You automatically gain the initial bloodline spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the Advanced Bloodline and Greater Bloodline feats.</p></li><li><p><strong>Blood Magic</strong> Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using a Focus Point or a sorcerous gift spell using a spell slot, you choose one blood magic effect you know to benefit from. You begin play with the benefit listed in your bloodline and can gain others through sorcerer feats.</p><ul><li><p>If the blood magic effect offers a choice, make it before resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects and, against a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references to spell rank refer to the rank of the spell you cast.</p></li></ul></li></ul>",

This, combined with the way that the two of you clearly act in tandem, makes it readily apparent to an intelligent observer that the two of you are connected in some way, even if the person has never encountered a summoner before.</p><p>You bring your eidolon into reality with the Manifest Eidolon action.</p><p>Your eidolon is no mere minion. It doesn't have the minion or summoned trait, and the two of you work together and coordinate your actions. You and your eidolon share your actions and multiple attack penalty. Each round, you can use any of your actions (including reactions and free actions) for yourself or your eidolon.</p><p>You coordinate your actions with your eidolon more efficiently when you Act Together. Your connection with your eidolon allows you to communicate with it telepathically at all times, even when it isn't manifested. You also gain the Share Senses action.</p><p>Lastly, the connection between you and your eidolon means you both share a single pool of Hit Points. Damage taken by either you or the eidolon reduces your Hit Points, while healing either of you recovers your Hit Points. Like with your actions, if you and your eidolon are both subject to the same effect that affects your Hit Points, you apply those effects only once (applying the greater effect, if applicable). For instance, if you and your eidolon get caught in an area effect that would heal or damage you both, only the greater amount of healing or damage applies.</p><h3>Gear and your Eidolon</h3><p>Your eidolon can't wear or use magic items, except for items with the eidolon trait. An eidolon can have up to two items invested. Your eidolon's link to you means it can benefit from certain magic items invested by you.</p><ul><li>Your eidolon gains item bonuses to Perception and skills from any magical items that you have invested.</li><li>Your eidolon increases its item bonus to AC based on your armor's armor potency rune or bracers of armor. It also gains an item bonus to its saves from the resilient rune on your armor or from your bracers of armor. Other permanent items that grant or increase item bonuses to AC and saves might convey a similar benefit, as determined by the GM.</li><li>Your eidolon's Strikes benefit from the fundamental and property runes on your handwraps of mighty blows. Alternatively, you can Invest a magic weapon (even though magic weapons can't normally be Invested) to share its fundamental and property runes with your eidolon. You share these benefits only while you're holding the weapon, and you can have no more than one weapon invested in this way at a time. In either case, the eidolon gains only the benefits that can apply to its attacks, with the same limitations noted in handwraps of mighty blows.</li></ul><h3>Lost and Altered Actions</h3><p>If you or your eidolon becomes slowed, stunned, quickened, or otherwise affected by something that changes the actions you gain at the start of each turn, it affects your shared actions. However, if you are both subject to such an effect, apply only the more severe one. For instance, if you or your eidolon were @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 1}, you would start your turn with one fewer action, but if you were both slowed 1, you would still lose only one action, rather than adding the two slowed effects together. However, if you were slowed 1 and your eidolon @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 2}, you'd have two fewer actions, because that's the more severe effect. If only one of you becomes restricted in how you can spend your actions, that restriction doesn't automatically extend to the other; for example, if your eidolon became @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] or petrified, it wouldn't be able to move, but you could still use your actions to move. The GM resolves any situation that's unclear.</p><p>You, as the player, control both your summoner and your eidolon, and the two are generally considered to cooperate unless you decide for them not to. While a summoner's link with an eidolon is a partnership, ultimately the eidolon is linked to you, not the other way around. If there's ever a conflict of who should act, you win out over your eidolon. This means that if the eidolon comes under an effect that would take its actions out of your control, such as the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Confused] or controlled condition, you can use all of your shared actions so your eidolon doesn't have any actions remaining to cause trouble (as long as you are able to act). However, if you came under such an effect, you would simply use all of your shared actions, preventing your eidolon from acting.</p><h2>Summoner Spellcasting</h2><p>Your link to your eidolon grants you limited magic connected to your eidolon's nature. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because of the magic you draw from your eidolon, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need a material component pouch.</p><p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-rank spell and five cantrips. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p><p>As you increase in level as a summoner, the magical link with your eidolon grants you additional, more powerful spell slots. Your total number of spell slots and the highest rank of spells you can cast are shown in Table 2-4: Summoner Spells per Day. Because of the way you draw magic from your connection to your eidolon, you begin to lose lower-rank spell slots once you reach 5th level. The maximum number of spell slots you get from the summoner class is four, starting when you reach 4th level.</p><p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447 of the Core Rulebook.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you gain spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest rank of spell you can cast as a summoner. For example, as a 1st-level summoner, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level summoner, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><h3>Spell Repertoire</h3><p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your eidolon, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it doesn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p><p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2-4: Summoner Spells per Day), you add a spell of the same rank to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell. At 3rd level, you add the first 2nd-rank spell to your repertoire. At 4th level you gain your second and your spell repertoire reaches its maximum size of five spells.</p><p>At 5th level, in addition to adding two 3rd-rank spells to your repertoire, you lose your lowest rank of spell slots. Any time you lose a rank of spell slots, you lose two spells in your repertoire as well. These can come from spells you already know or out of the number of new spells you're learning. On levels in which you don't change your spell slots, you can swap out multiple spells, as described below.</p><h3>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</h3><p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. If it's a level at which you lose a set of lower-rank slots, you can replace the two in either order. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p><p>At 6th level and every even level thereafter, you can swap out any number of your spells for different spells of a rank you can cast. When you do, you must keep at least one spell you can cast with your lowest rank of spell slots so you don't end up with slots you can't use. For instance, at 6th level you would need to keep at least one 2nd-rank spell, but all your other spells could be 3rd rank.</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Link Spells</h2><p>Your connection to your eidolon allows you to cast link spells, special spells that have been forged through your shared connection with your eidolon. Link spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to specifically connect with your eidolon, such as by having a heart-to-heart conversation, playing together, or meditating in unison on the nature of your bond.</p><p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear on page 300 of the Core Rulebook.</p><p>You learn the evolution surge link spell, which allows you to grant your eidolon one of several useful benefits.</p><h3>Link Cantrips</h3><p>Link cantrips are special link spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like. Link cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from your tradition's spell list. Generally, only feats can give you more link cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out link cantrips gained from summoner feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining.</p><p>You learn the boost eidolon link cantrip, which briefly improves your eidolon's capabilities, allowing it to attack with greater power.</p><h2>Evolution Feat</h2><p>Evolution feats are a special type of summoner class feat that allow you to customize your eidolon through your shared link. You gain an evolution feat for your eidolon at 1st level, representing the differences that make it unique from other eidolons of its type. If you retrain this feat, the feat you replace it with must also be an evolution feat.</p><h2>Skill Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p><h2>Summoner Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a summoner class feat.</p><h2>General Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p><h2>Shared Vigilance <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>You and your eidolon work together to remain alert to threats around you, allowing you to perceive far more together than you could individually. Your proficiency rank in Perception and your eidolon's proficiency rank in Perception increase to expert.</p><h2>Skill Increases <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p><p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p><h2>Unlimited Signature Spells <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>All of your spells are signature spells. That means that if you know a spell, you can heighten it freely by casting it from a higher-rank spell slot, up to the maximum rank of spell you can cast. You can similarly cast any of its lower-rank versions without learning them separately.</p><h2>Attribute Boosts <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p><p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p><p>Your eidolon also gets four attribute boosts at these levels. The eidolon's attribute boosts follow the same rules as yours.</p><h2>Ancestry Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p><h2>Eidolon Unarmed Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>Your eidolon becomes more capable of using its unarmed attacks. Its proficiency rank for unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p><h2>Eidolon Symbiosis <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Your connection with your eidolon strengthens, granting your eidolon access to a new ability depending on its type, as described in Eidolon Abilities in each eidolon's entry.</p><h2>Eidolon Weapon Specialization <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Your eidolon has learned how to inflict greater injuries with its unarmed attacks. It deals 2 additional damage with unarmed attacks in which it's an expert. This damage increases to 3 if it's a master, and 4 if it's legendary.</p><h2>Expert Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2><p>As your connection to your eidolon deepens, the power of your spells increases. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your eidolon's tradition increase to expert.</p><h2>Shared Reflexes <span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2><p>You and your eidolon boost each other's reflexes, allowing you both to roll away from danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves and your eidolon's proficiency rank for Reflex saves increase to expert.</p><h2>Eidolon Defensive Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>Your eidolon increases its ability to avoid attacks. Its proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to expert.</p><h2>Simple Weapon Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>Training and magic improved your weapon technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p><h2>Twin Juggernauts <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>You and your eidolon fight off physical hardship together with your shared life force. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves and your eidolon's proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increase to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead. When your eidolon rolls a success on a Fortitude save, it gets a critical success instead.</p><h2>Defensive Robes <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>The flow of magic around you increases your ability to avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p><h2>Eidolon Unarmed Mastery <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>Your eidolon truly masters its unarmed attacks, reaching greater heights. Its proficiency rank for unarmed attacks increases to master.</p><h2>Weapon Specialization <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p><h2>Greater Eidolon Specialization <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>Your eidolon's damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with unarmed attacks in which it's an expert, 6 if it's a master, and 8 if it's legendary.</p><h2>Shared Resolve <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>You and your eidolon steel your mind together against effects that threaten you, each protecting the others' minds from danger. Your and your eidolon's proficiency ranks for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. When your eidolon rolls a success on a Will save, it gets a critical success instead.</p><h2>Eidolon Transcendence <span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2><p>Your connection with your eidolon approaches its peak, granting your eidolon access to a powerful new ability depending on its type, as described in Eidolon Abilities in each eidolon's entry. This ability also increases one of the eidolon's attributes by +1.</p><h2>Master Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2><p>Your connection to your eidolon is strong enough to grant you mastery over associated spells. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your eidolon's tradition increase to master.</p><h2>Eidolon Defensive Mastery <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>Your eidolon's form becomes particularly difficult to assail.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p><h2>Esoteric Lore</h2><p>Your experience with the unknown, as well as the tales you've exchanged with other thaumaturges, has taught you about strange phenomena of every kind. You become trained in Esoteric Lore, a special lore skill that can be used to Recall Knowledge regarding haunts, curses, and creatures of any type, but that can't be used to Recall Knowledge of other topics. Unlike a normal Lore skill, you use Charisma as your modifier on Esoteric Lore checks. You also gain the Dubious Knowledge skill feat.</p><p>At 3rd level, you become an expert in Esoteric Lore; at 7th level, you become a master in Esoteric Lore; and at 15th level, you become legendary in Esoteric Lore.</p><h2>First Implement And Esoterica</h2><p>Your implement is a special object of symbolic importance: your badge as you treat with the supernatural and a powerful tool if things turn violent. Choose an implement from the options presented on page 36 (amulet, bell, chalice, lantern, mirror, regalia, tome, wand, and weapon). You begin play with a mundane item of that type, and you gain the initiate benefit for that implement. While an implement is useful to you, it typically has no value if sold. If you acquire a new object of the same general implement type, you can switch your implement to the new object by spending 1 day of downtime with the new item. As you advance as a thaumaturge, you will collect up to three implements and unlock the hidden potential stored within each, so you can mix and match their benefits to suit your situation.</p><p>While your implements are your primary tools in your dealings with the supernatural, you know the value of always being prepared. You constantly collect and carry various smaller mystic objects, bits of materials with paranormal affinities, and items used in folk practices: your esoterica. These might include cold-iron nails, scraps of scrolls and scriptures, fragments of bones purportedly from a saint, and other similar objects. You keep your esoterica in easy-to-access places on your person and are well practiced in brandishing your implement and esoterica together, so you can draw and use esoterica with the same hand you're using to wield an implement.</p><h3>Exploit Vulnerability</h3><p>Exploit Vulnerability</p><p>You gain the Exploit Vulnerability action.</p><h2>Implement's Empowerment</h2><p>The power of your implement can also be turned to the more common task of combat, its power adding to and amplifying the effects of runes and other magical empowerments. When you Strike, you can trace mystic patterns with an implement you're holding to empower the Strike, causing it to deal 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Channeling the power requires full use of your hands. You don't gain the benefit of implement's empowerment if you are holding anything in either hand other than a single one-handed weapon, other implements, or esoterica, and you must be holding at least one implement to gain the benefit.</p><h2>Thaumaturge Feats</h2><p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a thaumaturge class feat.</p><h2>Skill Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p><h2>General Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p><h2>Lightning Reflexes <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p><h2>Skill Increases <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p><p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p><h2>Attribute Boosts <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p><p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.

You gain the initiate benefit of your new implement.</p><p>While you're holding an implement in one hand, you can quickly switch it with another implement you're wearing to use an action from the implement you're switching to. To do so, you can Interact as a free action immediately before executing the implement's action. This allows you to meet requirements of having an implement in hand to use its action. For example, if you had your lantern implement in one hand, a weapon in the other, and a chalice implement you were wearing, you could swap your lantern for your chalice to use its reaction.</p><h2>Thaumaturge Weapon Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>You've learned the secret ways your weapons work most effectively.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Patron</h2><p>You weren't born with the power to cast spells, nor have you spent years dedicated to worship, study, or uncovering mystical secrets. Your magic instead has been gifted to you by a potent being, one who knows that by empowering you so, you'll further the being's agenda in the world, whatever it may be. This entity is typically mysterious and distant, revealing little of their identity and motivations. They make their will known to you in abstract signs such as omens, dreams, or similar subtleties rather than words.</p><p>Rather than interacting with you directly, your patron works through a familiarâ€”a mystical creature that teaches you, serves as the conduit for your patron's magic, and maybe even keeps an eye on you to ensure you're furthering your patron's nebulous ends.</p><p>At 1st level, choose your patron, which determines your spellcasting tradition and grants you the skill for that tradition of magic, your first witch's lesson and a unique familiar ability.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Witch Spellcasting</h2><p>Using your familiar as a conduit, your patron provides you the power to cast spells. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of your patron's tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a witch, when you cast spells, your incantations might rhyme, your gestures might be as simple as an ominous pointing finger or a complex folk sign, and your familiar might even echo your words or movements slightly as your patron's magic surges.</p><p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells your familiar knows. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots.</p><p>As you increase in level as a witch, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Witch Spells per Day table.</p><p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier.</p><h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd-rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The patron conduit class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded upâ€”this is usually equal to the highest rank of witch spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witch, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level witch, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells</p><h3><strong>Familiar</strong></h3><p>Your patron has sent you a familiar, a mystical creature that teaches you magic and facilitates your spells. Though as it's a direct conduit between you and your patron, it's more powerful than typical familiars. Your familiar gains two additional familiar abilities: one of these is a unique ability based on your patron and is always selected, and the other is an additional familiar ability that can be selected daily as normal. Your familiar gains another extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels</p><p><strong>Spells:</strong> Your familiar is the source and repository of the spells your patron has bestowed upon you, and you must commune with your familiar to prepare your spells each day using your witch spellcasting. Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-rank spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron's initial lesson. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to.</p><p>Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.</p><p><strong>Learning Spells:</strong> Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a written version of that spell over the course of 1 hour. This can be a scroll of that spell, or you can prepare a written version using the Learn a Spell exploration activity. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron. You can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar.</p><p><strong>Undying</strong>: If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless. Your familiar's death doesn't affect any spells you have already prepared.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Hexes</h2><p>As a favored agent of your patron, you can invoke their power for a more direct magical intervention. A hex is a spell shaped by your patron and sent to you through your familiar, rather than an ability you use directly. Your patron expects you to advance its interests and does not take kindly to repeated requests for aid; as such, you can use only one hex each turn, and any attempts to use a second hex on that turn fail and the actions are lost.</p><p>Hex spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with your familiar. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips.</p><p>Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear in on page 298.</p><p>You learn your choice of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Patron's Puppet] hex or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Phase Familiar] hex, which let you command your familiar or defend it from harm, respectively. You learn most other hexes from witch lessons.</p><p><strong>Hex Cantrips</strong></p><p>Hex cantrips are special hexes that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still cast only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with your witch spellcasting and aren't counted toward your prepared cantrips. You gain a hex cantrip determined by your choice of patron.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Skill Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Witch Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a witch class feat.</p><h2 class=\"title\">General Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p><p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Attribute Boosts <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p><p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Magical Fortitude <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>Your patron's power boosts your physical resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Expert Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>You've learned to better control the power your patron has granted you. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Reflex Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2><p>Your reflexes are lightning fast, helping you to avoid danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Perception Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>Through sheer experience, you've improved your technique with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Defensive Robes <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>The flow of magic through your spellcasting and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>You can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Master Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>You've achieved mastery over your patron's magic. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Will of the Pupil <span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2><p>Communion with your familiar has steeled your mental fortitude. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Legendary Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>You've perfected your command of the magic your patron provides. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Patron's Gift <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>Your patron grants you the power to command incredible works of magic. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Patron's Truth] feat to gain a second slot.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Patrons</h2><p>When your patron first makes contact, they usually reveal little more of themself than glimpses or specific manifestationsâ€”you might see eyes from the shadows of the forest or hear a wordless voice echoing across the frozen tundra before your familiar makes itself known. Your patron's true identity might be a powerful hag, a fey lord, a deity or demigod, an archdevil, or a similarly powerful entity, or perhaps multiple such figures working in tandem, but that identity is for you to attempt to discover as you learn more of your patron's lessons. Some patrons are multifaceted, appearing in different guises, and granting different powers to different witches. In some cases, the witch may know of their patron's identity, but have some other aspect shrouded in uncertainty; they might know their patron's name but not motive, or perhaps even if they know the patron's identity, they have been cursed to never reveal it to others.</p><p>Your patron determines the following.</p><p><strong>Spell List</strong> You use this magical tradition and spell list;</p><p><strong>Patron Skill</strong> You become trained in the skill associated with your patron's magical tradition.</p><p><strong>Initial Lesson</strong> This is the first lesson your patron teaches you and is unique to your patron.</p><p><strong>Familiar Ability</strong> One of your familiar's two bonus abilities is always the one listed here, a mark of your patron's indelible influence.

If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p><h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2><p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p><h2>Wizard Spellcasting</h2><p>Through dedicated study and practice, you can construct spells with academic rigor by shaping arcane magic. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life.</p><p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school (page 196). Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p><p>As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.</p><p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier.</p><h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p><h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded upâ€” this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><h3><strong>Spellbook</strong></h3><p>Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less (page 292), which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Tome of Silent Shadows</em> or something more academic, like <em>Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory</em>.</p><p>The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school).</p><p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to and learn via Learn a Spell. When you gain spell slots of a new rank, you also add an additional spell from your school's curriculum (unless it's the school of unified magical theory).</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The Archwizard's Spellcraft class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Arcane Thesis</h2><p>During your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research on one of a variety of topics. You gain a special benefit depending on the topic of your thesis research. The arcane thesis topics presented in this book are below; your specific thesis probably has a much longer and more technical title like \"On the Methods of Spell Interpolation and the Genesis of a New Understanding of the Building Blocks of Magic.\"</p><p>Arcane theses can be found here:</p><ul><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Experimental Spellshaping],</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Improved Familiar Attunement],</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Spell Blending],</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Spell Substitution], and</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Staff Nexus]</li></ul><h2>Arcane School</h2><p>Most wizards acquire their knowledge of spells from a formal educational institution, such as the Arcanamirium or the Magaambya. At 1st level, you choose your arcane school, which grants you magical abilities.</p><p>You gain additional spells and spell slots from the curriculum taught at the school you attended. Some wizards follow the school of unified magical theory, which attempts to forge a new school by studying independently and drawing information from a multitude of texts and tutors. Though a wizard with this approach lacks the focus of formal training, they have greater flexibility.</p><p>Your arcane school is where you devoted yourself to the study of spellcraft. Whether you learned in the storied halls of a formal institution, via an apprenticeship with an archmage, or taught yourself from secondhand tomes, your arcane school indelibly set the curriculum and direction of your magic.</p><p><strong>Curriculum Spells:</strong> You automatically add some of the spells listed in your school's curriculum to your spellbook. At 1st level, you add a cantrip and two 1st-rank spells of your choice. As soon as you gain the ability to cast wizard spells of a new rank, choose one of the spells from your curriculum of that rank to add to your spellbook. A superscript \"U\" indicates an uncommon spell. Your GM might allow you to swap or add other spells to your curriculum if they strongly fit the theme.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots:</strong> Each day, you can prepare an extra cantrip from your curriculum. You also gain an extra spell slot at each spell rank for which you have wizard spell slots. You can prepare only spells from your school's curriculum in these extra slots. Any spell listed in your curriculum of a suitable spell rank is eligible to be prepared in each of these extra slots, regardless of how you added the spell to your spellbook.</p><p><strong>School Spells:</strong> School spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to study your spellbook or conduct arcane research.</p><p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points.</p><p>You learn the initial school spell, which is unique to your school. You can learn the advanced school spell with the Advanced School Spell feat.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Ars Grammatica]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Battle Magic]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of the Boundary]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Civic Wizardry]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Mentalism]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Protean Form]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Unified Magical Theory]</p><h2>Arcane Bond</h2><p>You place some of your magical power in a bonded item. Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Drain Bonded Item] <span class=\"action-glyph\">F</span></h3><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You haven't acted yet on your turn</p><hr /><p>You expend the power stored in your bonded item. During your turn, you gain the ability to cast one spell you prepared today and already cast, without spending a spell slot. You must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell's other requirements.</p><h2>Skill Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p><h2>Wizard Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a wizard class feat.</p><h2>General Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p><h2>Skill Increases <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p><p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p><h2>Ancestry Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p><h2>Reflex Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p><h2>Expert Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Extended practice of the arcane has improved your capabilities. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert.</p><h2>Magical Fortitude <span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2><p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p><h2>Perception Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p><h2>Weapon Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>Through sheer experience, you've improved your technique with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p><h2>Defensive Robes <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>The flow of magic and your training combine to help you avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p><h2>Weapon Specialization <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p><h2>Master Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>You command superlative spellcasting ability. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master.</p><h2>Prodigious Will <span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2><p>Your mind is simply too complex and sophisticated to be tampered with. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p><h2>Archwizard's Spellcraft <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>You command the most potent arcane magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using wizard spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, though you can take the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Archwizard's Might] feat to gain a second slot.</p><h2>Legendary Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>You are a consummate spellcaster, blending both arcane theory and practical spellcraft. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary.</p>",
