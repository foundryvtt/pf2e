You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use special infused reagents that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science.</p>\n<p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Alchemical Crafting] feat, even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites, and you gain the four common 1st-level alchemical formulas granted by that feat. You can use this feat to create alchemical items as long as you have the items' formulas in your formula book.</p>\n<h3><strong>Infused Reagents</strong></h3>\n<p>You infuse reagents with your own alchemical essence, allowing you to create alchemical items at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you gain a number of batches of infused reagents equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use these reagents for either advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy, described below. Together, these infused reagents have light Bulk.</p>\n<p>As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your infused reagents from the previous day's preparations are instantly destroyed, and nonpermanent effects of your previous day's infused items immediately end. While infused reagents are physical objects, they can't be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than your daily preparations. Any such artificial reagents lack the infusion and are useless for advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy.</p>\n<h3><strong>Advanced Alchemy</strong></h3>\n<p>During your daily preparations, after producing new infused reagents, you can spend batches of those infused reagents to create infused alchemical items. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical reagent requirements. Your advanced alchemy level is equal to your level. For each batch of infused reagents you spend, choose an alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book, and make a batch of two of that item. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.</p>\n<h3><strong>Quick Alchemy</strong></h3>\n<p>If you need a specific alchemical item on the fly, you can use your infused reagents to quickly create it with the Quick Alchemy action.</p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Quick Alchemy]<span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Cost</strong> 1 batch of infused reagents</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Alchemist's Toolkit], the formula for the alchemical item you're creating, and a free hand.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You swiftly mix up a short-lived alchemical item to use at a moment's notice. You create a single alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book without having to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical reagents or needing to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3><strong>Formula Book</strong></h3>\n<p>An alchemist keeps meticulous records of the formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard formula book worth 10 sp or less for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to those you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to invent them with the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Inventor] feat.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>\n<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Research Field</h2>\n<p>Your inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe have led you to focus on a particular field of research. You might have a degree from an scientific institute, correspond with other researchers in your field, or work as a genius loner. Choose a field of research.</p>\n<p>Your research field adds a number of formulas to your formulas book; these are your signature items. When using a batch of infused reagents to create your signature items using advanced alchemy, you can create three items instead of two. Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature items with another formula in your formula book. This new signature item must be on your research field's list of possible signature items.</p>\n<p>Research fields can be found here (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bomber], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Chirurgeon], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Mutagenist] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Toxicologist]).</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.

You gain the ability to create two 1st-level alchemical items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.</p>\n<p>See specific research fields for more information.</p>\n<h2>Alchemical Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Constant practice has increased the effectiveness of your concoctions. Your proficiency rank for your alchemist class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Double Brew<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You know your formulas so well that you can concoct two items at once. When using the Quick Alchemy action, instead of spending one batch of infused reagents to create a single item, you can spend up to two batches of infused reagents to make up to two alchemical items as described in that action. These items do not have to be the same.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your body has become accustomed to physical hazards and resistant to pathogens and ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master.

Compositions are a special type of spell that often require you to use the Performance skill when casting them. Composition spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, write a new composition, or otherwise engage your muse.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>You learn the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Counter Performance] composition spell, protecting against auditory and visual effects.</p>\n<h3><strong>Composition Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Composition cantrips are special composition spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can use them as often as you like. Composition cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list. Generally, only feats can give you more composition cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out composition cantrips gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining. You learn the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Courageous Anthem] composition cantrip, which boosts your allies' attacks, damage, and defense against fear.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Muses</h2>\n<p>As a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads you to great things, and might be a physical creature, a deity, a philosophy, or a captivating mystery.</p>\n<p>Muses can be found here: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Maestro], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Polymath], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Enigma], and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Warrior].</p>\n<h2>Bard Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You draw upon magic from esoteric knowledge. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the occult tradition using the Cast a Spell activity.</p>\n<p>As a bard, when you cast spells, your incantations might be musical riffs or clever limericks, your gestures might incorporate dance and dramatic pantomiming, and you might accompany your spellcasting by playing a musical instrument.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Bard Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell’s rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The magnum opus class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank occult spells of your choice and five occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3-6), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn’t give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Bard Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Reflex Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve developed a knack for dodging danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you’re untrained in or become an expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.</p>\n<h2>Attribute Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your magical techniques grow stronger. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Fortitude Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your physique has grown hardy in your adventures. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Performer's Heart<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>The greatest performances require an understanding of your own mind and flawless concentration. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Bard Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. Your proficiency rank for martial weapons, simple weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons or an unarmed attack while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon or unarmed attack.</p>\n<h2>Perception Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 damage if you're a master, and 4 damage if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You pluck the threads of magic like the strings of a harp. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Performer's Heart<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your performances warp the mind and cause emotions to flower, and understanding how to do this also forges an incomparable understanding of your own mind. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against an effect that deals damage, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your command of magic is the stuff of legends. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Magnum Opus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have tuned your spellcasting to the highest caliber. Add two common 10th-rank occult spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells using bard spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you can’t use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don’t gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the Perfect Encore feat to gain a second slot.</p>",

Your devotion even attracts the attention of holy spirits who aid you on your journey.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Key Attribute: STRENGTH OR DEXTERITY</strong></p>\n<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>\n<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>\n<h1>Roleplaying the Champion</h1>\n<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You confront enemies in hand-to-hand combat while carefully positioning yourself to protect your allies.</p>\n<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You are a voice of hope, striving to reach a peaceful solution that strengthens bonds and yields good results for all.</p>\n<h2>While Exploring...</h2>\n<p>You overcome barriers both physical and spiritual, providing inspiration to your allies through your actions and-when your fellow adventurers ask for it-providing moral and ethical guidance.</p>\n<h2>In Downtime...</h2>\n<p>You spend much of your time in solemn prayer and contemplation, rigorous training, charity work, and fulfilling the tenets of your code, but that doesn't mean there isn't time to take up a craft or hobby.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe there is always hope that good will triumph over evil, no matter how grim the odds.</li>\n<li>Know the ends don't justify the means, since evil acts increase the power of evil.</li>\n<li>Have a strong sense of right and wrong, and grow frustrated when greed or shortsightedness breeds evil.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>See you as a symbol of hope, especially in a time of great need.</li>\n<li>Worry you secretly despise them for not living up to your impossible standard, or that you are unwilling to compromise when necessary.</li>\n<li>Know that you've sworn divine oaths of service they can trust you to keep.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

Deities often add additional strictures (for instance, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Torag]'s champions can't show mercy to enemies of their people, making it almost impossible for them to follow the redeemer cause). Only rules for good champions appear in this book. Tenets are listed in order of importance, starting with the most important. If a situation places two tenets in conflict, you aren't in a no-win situation; instead, follow the more important tenet. For instance, as a paladin, if an evil king asked you if you're hiding refugees so he could execute them, you could lie to him, since the tenet against lying is less important than preventing harm to innocents. Trying to subvert your code by creating a situation that forces a higher tenet to override a lower tenet (for example, promising not to respect authorities and then, to keep your word, disrespecting authorities) is a violation of the champion code.</p>\n<p>If you stray from your alignment or violate your code of conduct, you lose your focus pool and divine ally until you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Atone] ritual, but you keep any other champion abilities that don't require those class features. If your alignment shifts but is still one allowed by your deity, your GM might let you retrain your cause while still following the same deity.</p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.The Tenets of Good]</h3>\n<p>All champions of good alignment follow these tenets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must never perform acts anathema to your deity or willingly commit an evil act, such as murder, torture, or the casting of an evil spell.</li>\n<li>You must never knowingly harm an innocent, or allow immediate harm to one through inaction when you know you could reasonably prevent it. This tenet doesn't force you to take action against possible harm to innocents at an indefinite time in the future, or to sacrifice your life to protect them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.The Tenets of Evil]</h3>\n<p>All champions of evil alignment follow these tenets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must never perform acts anathema to your deity or willingly commit a purely good act, such as giving something solely out of charity, casting a good spell, or using a good item.</li>\n<li>You must never put another person's needs before your own, and you must never put your own needs before those of your deity. Though you can perform acts others might consider helpful, it must be done with the expectation that it ultimately furthers your own goals or those of your master.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Champion's Reaction</h2>\n<p>Your cause gives you a special reaction. See specific causes for more information.</p>\n<h2>Deific Weapon</h2>\n<p>You zealously bear your deity's favored weapon. If it's uncommon, you gain access to it. If it's an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12).</p>\n<h2>Deity and Cause</h2>\n<p>Champions are divine servants of a deity. Choose a deity to follow; your alignment must be one allowed for followers of your deity. Actions fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals or alignment are anathema to your faith. A few examples of acts that would be considered anathema appear in each deity's entry. You and your GM determine whether other acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>You have one of the following causes. Your cause must match your alignment exactly. Your cause determines your champion's reaction, grants you a devotion spell, and defines part of your champion's code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lawful good @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Paladin]</li>\n<li>Neutral good @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Redeemer]</li>\n<li>Chaotic good @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Liberator]</li>\n<li>Lawful evil @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Tyrant]</li>\n<li>Neutral evil @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Desecrator]</li>\n<li>Chaotic evil @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Antipaladin]</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Devotion Spells</h2>\n<p>Your deity's power grants you special divine spells called devotion spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. You gain a devotion spell depending on your cause, and you are trained in divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs. Your spellcasting attribute is Charisma.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Shield Block</h2>\n<p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Shield Block] general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Divine Ally<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Your devotion attracts a spirit of your deity's alignment. Once you choose an ally, your choice can't be changed.</p>\n<p>The following are divine allies:</p>\n<p><strong>Blade Ally</strong> A spirit of battle dwells within your armaments. Select one weapon or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Handwraps of Mighty Blows]{Handwraps of Mighty Blows (+1)} when you make your daily preparations. In your hands, the item gains the effect of a property rune.</p>\n<p>For a champion following the tenets of good, choose @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Vitalizing], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Ghost Touch], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Returning], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Shifting]. For a champion following the tenets of evil, choose @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Fearsome], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Returning], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Shifting]. You also gain the weapon's critical specialization effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Shield Ally</strong> A spirit of protection dwells within your shield. In your hands, the shield's Hardness increases by 2 and its HP and BT increase by half.</p>\n<p><strong>Steed Ally</strong> You gain a young animal companion as a mount. Ordinarily, your animal companion is one that has the mount special ability, such as a horse. You can select a different animal companion (GM's discretion), but this ability doesn't grant it the mount special ability.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Attribute Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You have spent so much time in armor that you know how to make the most of its protection. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Champion Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Prayers strengthen your divine power. Your proficiency ranks for your champion class DC and divine spell attack rolls and DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Divine Smite<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your champion's reaction improves.</p>\n<p>See specific causes for more information.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Divine Will<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your faith grants mastery of your will. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Exalt<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your champion's reaction exalts nearby allies, allowing them to benefit as well.</p>\n<p>See specific causes for more information.</p>\n<h2>Armor Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with armor improves, helping you avoid more blows. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Champion Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've mastered your arsenal of champion techniques and divine spells. Your proficiency ranks for your champion class DC and for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Armor<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You shield yourself with steel as easily as with faith. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Hero's Defiance<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You can defy fate and continue fighting as long as you have divine energy.

The most common deities in Pathfinder appear in the Deities compendium, along with their edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a cleric of that deity. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity’s favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon. </p>\n<p>Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list once you can prepare spells of their rank as a cleric. Any of these spells that aren’t normally on the divine list are still divine spells if you prepare them this way.</p>\n<p>A list of all deities can be found in the Deities compendium.</p>\n<h3><strong>Anathema</strong></h3>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity’s ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity’s good graces. </p>\n<p>Casting spells with the unholy trait is almost always anathema to deities who don’t allow unholy sanctification, and casting holy spells is likewise anathema to those who don’t allow holy sanctification. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don’t appear in any deity’s formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema. </p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all cleric spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Atone] ritual.</p>\n<h2>Divine Font</h2>\n<p>Through your deity’s blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either the life force called vitality or its counterforce, the void. When you prepare your spells each day, you can prepare additional @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Heal] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Harm] spells, depending on your deity. The divine font spell your deity provides is listed in the Divine Font entry for your deity; if both are listed, you can choose between heal or harm. Once you choose, you can’t change your choice short of divine intervention</p>\n<p><strong>Healing Font</strong> You gain 4 additional spell slots each day at your highest rank of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only heal spells in these slots. At 5th level, the number of additional slots increases to 5, and at 15th level, the total number of additional slots increases to 6.</p>\n<p><strong>Harmful Font</strong> You gain 4 additional spell slots each day at your highest rank of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only <em>harm</em> spells in these slots. At 5th level, the number of additional slots increases to 5, and at 15th level, the total number of additional slots increases to 6.</p>\n<h2>Cleric Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the divine tradition using the Cast a Spell activity (page 299). As a cleric, your chants generally invoke your deity and their powerful servants by name or title, while your gestures are followed by sacred symbols or other representations of your deity.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells to which you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots. </p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in Cleric Spells per Day table. </p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or for your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell’s rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of cleric spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*†</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*†</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\"><p>* Your divine font gives you additional <em>heal</em> or <em>harm</em> spells of this rank.

You often propose compromises that allow both sides to gain what they truly need, even if they can't have all that they desire.</p>\n<h2>While Exploring...</h2>\n<p>Your nature skills are invaluable. You track down enemies, navigate the wilderness, and use spells to detect magical auras around you. You might even ask wild animals to lend their extraordinary senses and scouting abilities to your group.</p>\n<h2>In Downtime...</h2>\n<p>You might craft magic items or potions. Alternatively, your tie to nature might lead you to tend a wilderness area, befriending beasts and healing the wounds caused by civilization.

If you repeatedly perform these acts, you lose your magical abilities from the druid class, including your druid spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance with an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Atone] ritual.</p>\n<p>The following acts are anathema to all druids.</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> despoil natural places, consume more natural resources than you require to live comfortably, teach the Wildsong to non-druids</p>\n<p>Your choice of druidic order adds further anathema, as detailed in the order’s entry.</p>\n<p>See specific orders for more information.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>\n<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>\n<h2>Wildsong</h2>\n<p>You know the Wildsong, a secret language known only within druid orders, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. The Wildsong is a melodic and tonal language sounding more like animal calls than a spoken tongue, and its alphabet involves fractals and spirals, like the arrangement of a seashell’s chambers, a snowflake’s crystals, or a fern’s fronds. Teaching the Wildsong to non-druids is anathema.</p>\n<h2>Druidic Order</h2>\n<p>Upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell, and an additional trained skill tied to your order. While you’ll always be a member of your initial order, it’s not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in search of greater understanding of the natural world, and PC druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of different orders.</p>\n<p>Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don’t require spell slots, and you can’t cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points.</p>\n<p>Orders can be found here (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Animal Order]{Animal}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Flame Order]{Flame}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Leaf Order]{Leaf}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Stone Order]{Stone}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Storm Order]{Storm}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Wave Order]{Wave}, and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Untamed Order]{Wild}).</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies, representing your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Druid Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>The power of the wild world flows through you. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the primal tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a druid, your spellcasting incantations might be pleas to the environment around you or the invocation of ancient vows; your hands might sway like willows or curl into clawlike shapes as your gestures direct your magic.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list, or from other primal spells to which you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Druid Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell’s rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day.

At 1st level, your way grants you an initial deed, a unique reload action called a slinger's reload, and proficiency with a particular skill. You also gain advanced and greater deeds at later levels, as well as access to way-specific feats. The gunslinger ways are described in detail on page 108. The following ways are presented in this book.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Drifter</strong> You wander across the battlefield, equally at home in and out of the fray.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Pistolero</strong> You carefully maintain your distance at a duelist's 10 paces with pistol in hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Sniper</strong> You practice a methodical style of shooting, striking from far cover.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Vanguard</strong> You rely on a brutal combat style that uses heavy weapons and explosive attacks.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinger Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a gunslinger class feat.</p>\n<h2>Singular Expertise</h2>\n<p>You have particular expertise with guns and crossbows that grants you greater proficiency with them and the ability to deal more damage. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage rolls with firearms and crossbows.</p>\n<p>This intense focus on firearms and crossbows prevents you from reaching the same heights with other weapons. Your proficiency with unarmed attacks and with weapons other than firearms and crossbows can't be higher than trained, even if you gain an ability that would increase your proficiency in one or more other weapons to match your highest weapon proficiency (such as the weapon expertise feats many ancestries have). If you have gunslinger weapon mastery, the limit is expert, and if you have gunslinging legend, the limit is master.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Stubborn<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You don't like being told what to do, and you don't give up. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert. When you fail, but don't critically fail, a Will save against an effect that would give you the controlled condition, you can attempt a second save against the effect at the start of your next turn. On a successful second save, the controlled condition ends, though any other effects remain. As normal, failing this second save doesn't allow you to attempt a third save on the subsequent turn.</p>\n<h2>Attribute Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinger Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand the best way to utilize your unique weapons. Your proficiency rank increases to master with simple and martial firearms and crossbows.

Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Deed<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned a powerful new technique of your chosen way. You gain the advanced deed ability of the way you chose at 1st level.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinger Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your special shots become harder for opponents to predict or resist. Your proficiency rank for your gunslinger class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Evasion<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinging Legend<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned unique techniques for wielding firearms and crossbows that give you unmatched skill in their use. Your proficiency rank increases to legendary with simple and martial firearms and crossbows and to master with advanced firearms and crossbows. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Greater Deed<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You've mastered the pinnacle technique of your chosen way. You gain the greater deed ability of the way you chose at 1st level.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your body has become accustomed to physical hazards and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Shootist's Edge<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You make shots others find impossible. Your proficiency rank for your gunslinger class DC increases to master. When using a ranged weapon in which you have master or greater proficiency, you ignore the penalty for attacking within the weapon's second and third range increments.</p>\n<h2>Incredible Senses<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You notice things that most people can't detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge or absorb blows.

Choose one of the below innovations. Your innovation's level is equal to your level. If your innovation is destroyed, you can spend 1 day of downtime and attempt a Crafting check with a high DC for your level; on a success, you rebuild it. An innovation only works due to your constant maintenance and tinkering, and therefore has no market Price.</p>\n<p>The innovations you can choose from in this book are as follows.</p>\n<h3>Armor</h3>\n<p>Your innovation is a cutting-edge suit of medium armor with a variety of attached gizmos and devices. Choose one of the sets of statistics on Table 2-2: Innovation Armor Statistics for your innovation armor (or choose another set of innovation armor statistics to which you have access).</p>\n<p>Your innovation armor can have fundamental and property runes added to it in the same way as ordinary armor. Because of the unique features of your innovation, everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be trained (or better) in medium armor. Choose one initial armor modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial armor modifications to which you have access.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Harmonic Oscillator</strong> You designed your armor to inaudibly thrum at just the right frequency to create interference against force and sound waves. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to force and sonic damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Metallic Reactance</strong> The metals in your armor are carefully alloyed to ground electricity and protect from acidic chemical reactions. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to acid and electricity damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Muscular Exoskeleton (Power Suit Only)</strong> Your armor supports your muscles with a carefully crafted exoskeleton. When you send your armor into overdrive, the exoskeleton supplements your feats of athletics as well. When under the effects of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks; if you're a master in Crafting, this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.</li>\n<li><strong>Otherworldly Protection</strong> Just because you use science doesn't mean you can't build your armor with carefully chosen materials and gizmos designed to protect against otherworldly attacks. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to void damage, or to vitality damage if you have void healing (such as if you're a dhampir). You gain the same amount of resistance to any types of alignment damage-good, evil, chaotic, lawful-that can damage you (note that creatures don't take a given type of alignment damage unless they are of the opposing alignment; for instance, you can take evil damage only if you are good in alignment).</li>\n<li><strong>Phlogistonic Regulator</strong> A layer of insulation within your armor protects you from rapid temperature fluctuations. You gain resistance equal to half your level to cold and fire damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Speed Boosters</strong> You have boosters in your armor that increase your Speed. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed, which increases to a +10-foot status bonus when under the effects of Overdrive.</li>\n<li><strong>Subtle Dampeners (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've designed your armor to help you blend in and dampen noise slightly. When you send your armor into overdrive, the dampeners increase their effect, improving your Stealth. When under the effects of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks. If you're a master in Crafting, this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th><p>Medium Armor</p>\n</th>\n<th><p>AC Bonus</p>\n</th>\n<th><p>Dex Cap</p>\n</th>\n<th><p>Check Penalty</p>\n</th>\n<th><p>Speed Penalty</p>\n</th>\n<th><p>Strength</p>\n</th>\n<th><p>Bulk</p>\n</th>\n<th><p>Group</p>\n</th>\n<th><p>Armor Traits</p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><p>Power Suit</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>+4</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>+1</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>-2</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>-5 feet</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>+3</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>2</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>composite</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>-</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><p>Subterfuge Suit</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>+1</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>+4</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>-1</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>-</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>+0</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>1</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>composite</p>\n</td>\n<td><p>-</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Construct</h3>\n<p>Your innovation is a mechanical creature, such as a clockwork construct made of cogs and gears. It's a prototype construct companion, and you can adjust most of its base statistics by taking feats at higher levels, such as Advanced Companion. If you use the Overdrive action, your construct gains the same Overdrive benefits you do, and it also takes the same amount of fire damage on a critical failure.</p>\n<p>You know how to spend additional time directing, controlling, or programming your construct innovation for a more complex plan of action. You can spend 2 actions to Command instead of 1 when commanding your construct companion; your construct companion can then use an additional action (normally 3 actions, rather than 2).</p>\n<p>Choose one initial construct modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial construct modifications to which you have access. These modifications alter the construct's abilities or form.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accelerated Mobility</strong> Actuated legs, efficient gears in the wheels or treads, or add-on boosters make your construct faster. Your innovation's Speed increases to 40 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Amphibious Construction</strong> Increased buoyancy, rudders, and a means of propulsion like a fluked tail or powerful propeller make your construct able to travel in water. Your innovation gains a swim Speed of 25 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased Size</strong> You built your construct innovation bigger than most. Your construct is Large. If you have this modification and your construct innovation becomes an advanced construct companion or otherwise gains the ability to become Large, you can immediately change increased size to a different initial construct modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Manual Dexterity</strong> Your construct innovation has articulated hands or similar appendages with significant manual dexterity. It can perform manipulate actions with up to two of its limbs. As normal for a companion, it still can't wield weapons or held items that don't have the companion trait, and it can't activate items.</li>\n<li><strong>Projectile Launcher</strong> Your construct has a mounted dart launcher, embedded cannon, or similar armament. Your innovation gains a ranged unarmed attack that deals 1d4 bludgeoning or piercing damage (you choose when you pick this modification). The attack has the propulsive trait and a range increment of 30 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Sensory Array</strong> Additional sensory devices give your innovation low-light vision and darkvision, as well as imprecise tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Wonder Gears</strong> You map specialized skills into your construct's crude intelligence. Your innovation becomes trained in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weapon</h3>\n<p>Your innovation is an impossible-looking weapon augmented by numerous unusual mechanisms. It begins with the same statistics as a level 0 common simple or martial weapon of your choice, or another level 0 simple or martial weapon to which you have access. You can instead use the statistics of a 1st-level common simple or martial weapon of your choice, or another 1st-level simple or martial weapon to which you have access, but you must pay the monetary Price for the weapon. An innovation weapon can have fundamental and property runes added to it in the same way as an ordinary weapon. Because of the unique features of your innovation, everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be trained (or better) in simple or martial weapons. If you use the Overdrive action, you can choose to change the additional damage from Overdrive to fire damage. Choose one initial weapon modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial weapon modifications to which you have access. These modifications grant additional weapon traits, sometimes with extra abilities. A modification might give your weapon the versatile trait with a damage type that the weapon could already deal, either from its base damage type or from an existing versatile trait. In that case, if you select that modification, you can instead choose to give the weapon the versatile trait for a different damage type: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blunt Shot (Ranged Only)</strong> Your weapon innovation can file the edges off your ammunition and adjust the blunt force of the shot to deliver a bludgeoning attack when necessary, as well as to avoid striking a lethal blow with an otherwise deadly shot. Your innovation gains the nonlethal and versatile B traits. You can choose whether to apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with your innovation.</li>\n<li><strong>Complex Simplicity (Simple Weapon Only)</strong> Increase your innovation's weapon damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). In addition, it gains one of the following traits of your choice: versatile B, versatile P, or versatile S.</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic Weighting (One-handed Melee Weapon Only; Can't Have the Agile, Attached, or Free-hand Trait)</strong> Your weapon's modified weight distribution can increase power in exchange for taking more hands to wield. Your innovation gains the two-hand trait, with a damage die one size higher than the weapon's normal weapon damage die size (for instance, a longsword would gain the two-hand d10 trait). Your innovation also gains the versatile B trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Entangling Form (Melee Only)</strong> You've altered your weapon to including tangling wires or straps, or to have a flexible construction. Your innovation gains the grapple and trip traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Hampering Spikes (Melee Only)</strong> You've added long, snagging spikes to your weapon, which you can use to impede your foes' movement. Your innovation gains the hampering and versatile P traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Hefty Composition (Melee Only)</strong> Blunt surfaces and sturdy construction make your weapon hefty and mace-like. Your innovation gains the shove and versatile B traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Modular Head</strong> You've constructed a multi-purpose, adjustable striking surface for your weapon, or you've made special ammunition you can swiftly alter. Your innovation gains the modular trait for bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. When you Interact to use the modular trait, you can also choose to give the weapon the nonlethal trait if it doesn't currently have it, or to remove that trait if it's currently nonlethal.</li>\n<li><strong>Pacification Tools (Melee Only)</strong> Softer materials make your weapon suited to knock out instead of kill, and special protrusions let you catch weapons and disarm your foes. Your innovation gains the disarm and nonlethal traits. You can choose whether to apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with your innovation.</li>\n<li><strong>Razor Prongs (Melee Only)</strong> You can knock down and slash your foes with sharp, curved blades added to your weapon. Your innovation gains the trip and versatile S traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Segmented Frame</strong> Hinges, clamps, and telescoping parts make your innovation collapsible and adjustable. It gains the modular trait for bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. You can Interact to collapse the item down to light Bulk or to return it to your normal form. When it's collapsed to light Bulk, it has the concealable trait, which grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks and DCs to hide or conceal the weapon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Explode</h2>\n<p>Your innovation is a creation barely held together by your own engineering, always on the edge of completely falling apart. Though this adds risk, it also means you can coax it to perform far beyond its design specifications using special unstable actions. See the definition of the unstable trait and how it affects your innovation.</p>\n<p>While inventors can learn various unstable actions over their career, all at least know how to make their innovation Explode.</p>\n<h2>Peerless Inventor</h2>\n<p>You are constantly inventing, and your skill at crafting is unimpeachable. You gain the Inventor skill feat, even if you don't meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<h2>Shield Block</h2>\n<p>You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.</p>\n<h2>Inventor Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an inventor class feat. Some features and feats use an assortment of gizmos you keep on your person. For simplicity, these are left abstract, but if you are deprived of your gear for some reason, you might lose access to many feats and features, subject to GM discretion.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Expert Overdrive<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You've increased your skill in crafting, and you can put your devices into a more powerful state of overdrive. You become an expert in Crafting, and on a successful use of Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by 1.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Reconfigure<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You've become an expert in all crafts and are always adjusting your inventions. You can attempt to change the modifications on your innovation by spending 1 day of downtime tinkering with it and attempting a Crafting check, with a high DC for your level. On a success, you can change one modification you've chosen for your innovation to a different modification of the same kind (initial, breakthrough, or revolutionary).</p>\n<p>If you have any modification feats, on a successful check you can choose to instead retrain a modification feat to a different modification feat. The new feat has to meet the standard restrictions for retraining.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Attribute Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Inventor Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You develop tricks for using your weapons more effectively. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<p>If you have a weapon innovation, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with your innovation.</p>\n<h2>Breakthrough Innovation<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've made a breakthrough in your field of study and discovered a powerful new way to enhance your innovation. Choose a breakthrough modification of your innovation's type to apply to your innovation. You can choose an initial modification of your innovation's type instead if you prefer.</p>\n<h3>Breakthrough Armor Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Antimagic Plating</strong> Whether you used some clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal known as noqual or created magical protections of your own design, you've strengthened your armor against magic. While wearing the armor, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saving throws against spells and to AC against spells. Against spells that target the armor directly (like heat metal), you instead gain a +4 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and to AC.</li>\n<li><strong>Camouflage Pigmentation (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've modified your armor's exterior to let you blend into your surroundings with ease, as long as you stay still. While wearing your armor, you can Hide even without cover or concealment, as the pigmentation shifts to match your surroundings.</li>\n<li><strong>Dense Plating</strong> You have encased your armor in robust plating. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to slashing damage equal to half your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Resistance</strong> You've improved upon your initial modification's ability to resist damage. The resistance from your initial armor modification adds your full level, instead of half your level (for instance, phlogistonic regulator's resistance would increase to your level). If you have more than one initial modification that gives resistance, choose which one this applies to.</li>\n<li><strong>Heavy Construction (Power Suit Only)</strong> You've expanded your innovation into a heavy bulwark, and your groundbreaking design ensures you don't take any of the drawbacks for such heavy defenses. Your innovation becomes heavy armor, and your proficiency in your innovation armor (but no other heavy armor) advances to be equal to your proficiency in medium armor. If your Strength modifier is at least +3, you remove the Speed penalty entirely instead of reducing it to -5 feet. The armor's adjusted statistics are: AC Bonus +5; Dex Cap +1; Check Penalty -2; Speed Penalty -10 feet; Strength +3; Bulk 3; Group composite; Armor Traits bulwark.</li>\n<li><strong>Hyper Boosters</strong> You've improved your speed boosters' power through a breakthrough that significantly increases the energy flow without risking exploding. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed, which increases to a +20-foot status bonus when you're in Overdrive. If you're legendary in Crafting, it instead increases to a +30-foot status bonus when you're in Overdrive. You must have the speed boosters modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Layered Mesh</strong> You've woven an incredibly powerful network of interlocking mesh around your armor, which catches piercing attacks and diffuses them. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to piercing damage equal to half your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Tensile Absorption</strong> You've enhanced the tensile capabilities of your armor, enabling it to bend with bludgeoning attacks. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to half your level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breakthrough Construct Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced Weaponry</strong> You've powered up your construct's weaponry. Choose one of your construct's unarmed attacks to gain your choice of one initial weapon modification, chosen from the list on page 18 or from other initial weapon modifications to which you have access. The unarmed attack must meet any requirements for the chosen traits (such as being a melee attack for entangling form), and since it's an unarmed attack, it can never meet certain requirements, such as being a simple weapon for complex simplicity.</li>\n<li><strong>Antimagic Construction</strong> Whether you used some clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal known as noqual or created magical protections entirely of your own devising, you've made your innovation highly resilient to spells. Your construct innovation gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and AC against spells.</li>\n<li><strong>Climbing Limbs</strong> With appendages that can claw or create suction, your construct becomes a capable climber. Your innovation gains a climb Speed equal to half its land Speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Durable Construction</strong> Your innovation is solidly built; it can take significant punishment before being destroyed. Increase its maximum HP by your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Marvelous Gears</strong> Your innovation gains expert proficiency in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival. For any of these skills in which it was already an expert (because of being an advanced construct companion, for example), it gains master proficiency instead. If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, these proficiencies improve to master, or legendary if your construct innovation was already an expert. You must have the wonder gears modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Turret Configuration</strong> Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary turret. Your construct companion can transform as a single action, which has the manipulate trait, turning into a turret in its space (or transforming back from a turret into its normal configuration). While it's a turret, your innovation is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized], but the damage die from its projectile launcher increases to 1d6 and the range increment increases to 60 feet. You must have the projectile launcher modification to select this modification.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breakthrough Weapon Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced Rangefinder (Ranged Only)</strong> A carefully tuned scope or targeting device makes your weapon especially good at hitting weak points. Your innovation gains the backstabber trait and increases its range increment by 10 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Aerodynamic Construction (Melee Only)</strong> You carefully engineer the shape of your weapon to maintain its momentum in attacks against successive targets. Your innovation gains the sweep trait and the versatile S trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Inconspicuous Appearance (Melee Only)</strong> Your innovation is built for easy concealment and surprise attacks. It gains the backstabber and versatile P traits. If the weapon has light Bulk, it also gains the concealable trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrated Gauntlet (One-Handed Weapon Only; Can't Have the Two-Hand Trait)</strong> Combining your weapon with a gauntlet, you make it so you can quickly switch between attacking with your weapon and tinkering using your hands. Your innovation gains the free-hand trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Manifold Alloy</strong> You've devised several alloys that contain useful properties of various metals, and you replace a number of parts of your weapon or its ammunition with pieces from these alloys. Your weapon innovation is cold iron and silver. This means you deal more damage to a variety of supernatural creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.</li>\n<li><strong>Rope Shot (Ranged Only)</strong> Your weapon can shoot projectiles that split into simple ropes or nets around your foes' legs to trip your targets, and you can climb using the grappling hooks built into the weapon. Your weapon innovation gains the climbing and ranged trip traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Tangle Line (Thrown Only)</strong> Your weapon has an extensible line that you can use to knock your enemies over and quickly recall the weapon back to your hand. Your innovation gains the ranged trip trait and the tethered trait.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Master Overdrive<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your mastery of invention and crafting enhances your Overdrive even further. You become a master in Crafting, and on a successful Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by a total of 2, replacing the increase from expert overdrive.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Inventive Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Through innovation and experimentation, you've made your inventions more effective and reliable. Your proficiency rank for your inventor class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Offensive Boost<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've made additions to your innovation to upgrade your offensive capabilities. Your improvements make any Strikes that rely on your innovation deal an additional 1d6 damage, with a type determined by the boost you choose. If your innovation is armor, the boost applies to your melee unarmed Strikes and to your melee Strikes with one weapon you choose during daily preparations; if your innovation is a construct, the boost applies to your construct companion's Strikes; and if your innovation is a weapon, the boost applies to your Strikes with your innovation. You can spend downtime to switch to a different boost in the same way as switching your modification. Choose one of the following boosts, with the damage type in parentheses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chill (Cold)</strong> Your innovation rapidly absorbs heat, creating an intense chill.</li>\n<li><strong>Ignition (Fire)</strong> Your innovation shoots out jets of searing flame.</li>\n<li><strong>Jolt (Electricity)</strong> Your innovation jolts foes with charges of electricity.</li>\n<li><strong>Momentum (Bludgeoning)</strong> Your innovation slams into foes with added momentum.</li>\n<li><strong>Saws (Slashing)</strong> Your innovation reveals spinning sawblades during your attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Spike (Piercing)</strong> Your innovation reveals wicked spikes during your attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Vitriol (Acid)</strong> Your innovation releases spurts of caustic acid.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to better defend yourself against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert. If you have a medium or heavy armor innovation, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with your armor innovation.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your attention to detail lets you remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Complete Reconfiguration<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>When it comes to crafting and tinkering, you've become incredibly adept at changing your modifications to adjust your innovation's functionality. When you spend downtime to reconfigure your innovation and succeed at your Crafting check, you can swap any number of modifications, swap your offensive boost, or retrain any number of modification feats, rather than one. You still must swap a modification only with one of the same type (initial, breakthrough, or revolutionary).</p>\n<h2>Inventor Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Overdrive<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your peerless inventing and Crafting ability has supercharged your Overdrives. You become legendary in Crafting, and on a successful Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by a total of 3, replacing the increase from master overdrive.</p>\n<h2>Revolutionary Innovation<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You are an unparalleled genius and have discovered a technique that will revolutionize your chosen field-or at least for the time being, your innovation! Choose a revolutionary modification to apply to your innovation. You can also choose an initial or breakthrough modification of the same type instead, if you prefer.</p>\n<h3>Revolutionary Armor Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automated Impediments</strong> Your armor uses electromagnetic fields, subharmonic distortions, or other techniques to make it difficult for those close to you to move unless you allow it. While wearing your armor, all spaces adjacent to you are difficult terrain for your enemies.</li>\n<li><strong>Energy Barrier</strong> Your armor's defenses ablate any kind of energy coming your way. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to all energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, sonic, vitality, and void damage) equal to 2 + half your level. You must have the harmonic oscillator, metallic reactance, or phlogistonic regulator modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Incredible Resistance</strong> You've improved upon your breakthrough modification's ability to resist damage. Choose one of the following breakthrough modifications your innovation has: dense plating, layered mesh, or tensile absorption. Increase the resistance you gain from that modification to be equal to your level, instead of half your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Multisensory Mask (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've built a multisensory mask over your armor that protects you by distorting your figure from all senses, leaving behind only a hazy image, muffled sounds, and so forth. While wearing the armor, you gain concealment against all creatures, even if they are using a nonvisual precise sense, such as a bat's echolocation. As normal for effects that leave your location obvious, you can't use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. If you use a hostile action, the concealment ends until you restore the mask as a single action, which has the manipulate trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Perfect Fortification (Power Suit Only)</strong> You've outfitted your armor with such heavy fortifications that deadly attacks often lose their edge. Each time you're critically hit while wearing the armor, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:13|showDC:owner] check. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. This isn't cumulative with fortification runes or other abilities that reduce critical hits with a flat check. Additionally, you gain resistance 2 + half your level against precision damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Physical Protections</strong> Your armor has so many adjustments and precautions that it can guard against all physical damage. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to all physical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as persistent bleed damage) equal to half your level. You must have the dense plating, layered mesh, or tensile absorption breakthrough modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Rune Capacity</strong> Whether you've done some dabbling in orichalcum alloys or found another engineering solution, you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 potency armor).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Revolutionary Construct Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flight Chassis</strong> You fit your construct with a means of flight, such as adding rotors or rebuilding it with wings and a lightweight construction. Your innovation gains a fly Speed of 25 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Miracle Gears</strong> As you perfect your innovation's cortex, it becomes much more intelligent. Its Intelligence modifier increases by 2, and it learns a language of your choice from among the languages you know. Your construct gains the ability to use actions that require greater Intelligence, like Coerce and Decipher Writing. Finally, your construct becomes legendary in two Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills of your choice. You must have the marvelous gears modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Resistant Coating</strong> Your innovation is hard to damage by any means. It gains resistance 5 to all damage (except adamantine).</li>\n<li><strong>Runic Keystone</strong> You've incorporated a device similar to a runestone into your innovation, allowing it to hold a property rune, even though it isn't a weapon or suit of armor. An armor property rune affects your innovation itself if it would affect the wearer of the armor. A weapon property rune grants whatever properties it would normally grant to a weapon to your innovation's unarmed attacks, following all the requirements as normal (for instance, a vorpal rune would only apply to slashing melee unarmed attacks); if the rune affects only ranged attacks, it has no effect unless your innovation has a built-in ranged attack (from the projectile launcher initial modification, for example). If the rune would affect the physical shape or appearance of the weapon or armor itself, like glamered, the rune has no effect when etched into your construct.</li>\n<li><strong>Wall Configuration</strong> Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary battlefield emplacement. It can unfold as a 2-action activity that has the manipulate trait, changing from its usual form into a thin, straight wall of metal and gears up to 10 feet tall and 30 feet long. The wall must extend through your innovation's original space. While your construct is a wall, it can't take any actions except to use the same activity to transform back, and it can't defend itself easily, making it @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] and giving it an additional -2 status penalty to its AC. The wall blocks line of sight and effect unless your innovation has half its maximum HP or fewer, at which point holes in the wall allow creatures to see through and attack with cover, and Tiny creatures to slip through.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Revolutionary Weapon Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attack Refiner</strong> Your weapon makes minute recalibrations after every missed attack to ensure the next lands true. Your innovation gains the backswing and shove traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Deadly Strike</strong> Through precise calculation, you've found the perfect shape for your weapon to deal extreme damage on a well-placed strike. Your innovation gains the deadly d8 trait. If your innovation was already deadly, it increases its deadly die to d12 instead of gaining deadly d8.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Damage</strong> You've made your innovation more powerful than other weapons of its kind. Increase your innovation's weapon damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). As normal, you can't increase your die by more than one size, so this modification isn't cumulative with complex simplicity.</li>\n<li><strong>Extensible Weapon (Melee only)</strong> You've found a way to construct your weapon so that it can extend while leaving its balance unchanged. Your innovation gains the reach trait. If the weapon already had the reach trait, it increases your reach by an additional 10 feet, instead of the usual additional 5 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Impossible Alloy</strong> Other inventors claim it's not even technically possible, but you've managed to create several metal alloys that seem to work for only you. These alloys can damage opponents vulnerable to any one of the seven skymetals. Your innovation is treated as all seven skymetals (abysium, adamantine, djezet, inubrix, noqual, orichalcum, and siccatite). This means you deal more damage to a variety of creatures, though you don't apply any of the other special effects for weapons made of those skymetals.</li>\n<li><strong>Momentum Retainer (Melee only)</strong> A special weighted device lets your weapon retain more of its momentum when you attack. Your innovation gains the forceful and versatile B traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Omnirange Stabilizers (Ranged only)</strong> You've modified your innovation to be dangerous and effective at any range. If your innovation had the volley trait, remove the volley trait. Otherwise, increase your innovation's range increment by 50 feet or an amount equal to the weapon's base range increment, whichever is more.</li>\n<li><strong>Rune Capacity</strong> Whether you've dabbled with orichalcum or found another engineering solution, you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 potency weapon).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Inventive Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your inventions are incredibly effective. Your proficiency rank for your inventor class DC increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Infinite Invention<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your ability to adjust your innovation has reached impossible heights, and you can use these skills to make major adjustments in your spare time. During your daily preparations, you automatically fix your innovation if it's destroyed or broken, and you can change to a different innovation (armor, construct, weapon, or other type you have access to) and change your modifications and offensive boost.</p>\n<p>If you have any feats that had your previous innovation as a prerequisite, you can't use them until you retrain the feats as normal. However, it takes you only 1 day of downtime to retrain such a feat into a feat that has your new innovation as a prerequisite, instead of 1 week.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with armor improves, helping you avoid more blows. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.</p>",

These are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Kinetic Gate</h2>\n<p>As a kineticist, you've awakened or opened a kinetic gate, a supernatural conduit within your body that can channel elemental forces straight from the elemental planes. You can choose either a single gate (one element) or dual gate (two elements) at 1st level.</p>\n<p>When selecting an element for your kinetic gate, you can pick from six elements - air, earth, fire metal, water, and wood. Elements you can channel are referred to as your kinetic elements. Your kinetic elements function even in environments where they normally wouldn't. For example, you could use fire actions underwater even though that's normally not possible, and you could create air in a vacuum.</p>\n<p>Your kinetic gate gives you impulse feats, magical actions that let you shape and control your elements in awesome ways. You can select more impulse feats using your kineticist class feats, as described under Impulses. At higher levels, the gate's threshold class feature gives you more impulse feats and lets you choose whether to improve with one element or access new kinetic elements.</p>\n<h3><strong>Single Gate</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic gate links to a single elemental plane, starting you with a single element but giving you greater power with it. Choose one element to be your kinetic element, and select two 1st-level impulse feats that have that element's trait.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain an impulse junction, a benefit that occurs when you use an impulse of the chosen element that takes 2 actions or more. This happens before the other effects of the impulse, unless noted otherwise. You can gain only one impulse junction per round; they are described in full below.</p>\n<p><strong>Air</strong> Before or after the other effects of the impulse, you can either Stride up to half your Speed or Step. If you have a fly Speed, you can Fly up to half your fly Speed instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Earth</strong> Fragments of stone float around you, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Fire</strong> Increase the damage die size of fire damage dealt by the impulse by one step.</p>\n<p><strong>Metal</strong> Choose acid, electricity, or piercing. Until the start of your next turn, each time a creature touches you or damages you with an unarmed melee attack or nonreach melee weapon, it takes damage of the chosen type equal to half your level (minimum 1 damage).</p>\n<p><strong>Water</strong> After the impulse's other effects, you can move one creature targeted by the impulse or in its area 5 feet in any direction, or 10 feet if it's in a body of water. This can't move the creature into the air. You can choose only a creature that's willing to be moved, that failed its save against the impulse, or that you succeeded at an impulse attack roll against.</p>\n<p><strong>Wood</strong> You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level that last until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3><strong>Dual Gate</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic gate is a harmonious conduit between two planes, allowing you to combine their elements to give you a versatile set of abilities. Select two elements to be your kinetic elements. Then, select two 1st-level impulse feats, one with the trait of the first element and one with the trait of the other.</p>\n<h2>Kinetic Aura</h2>\n<p>Through your kinetic gate, elements flow from an elemental plane to orbit your person. The form and appearance of this kinetic aura are unique to you. Examples include a chaotic wind orbiting the body, fragments of floating gravel, colorful wicks of flame stars of raw metal always changing shape, floatin snowflakes or splinters dancing in the air. If you can channel more than one element, pieces of all your kinetic elements appear in the aura.</p>\n<p>You have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Channel Elements] action, which lets you activate your kinetic aura.</p>\n<h2>Impulses</h2>\n<p>An impulse is a special type of magical action available to kineticists, allowing them to wield or shape their element into diverse and powerful forms. To wield an element, you must have your kinetic aura active and have a free hand, as described in the impulse trait. You automatically gain the Elemental Blast and Base Kinesis impulses, and your kinetic gate selection gives you additional impulse feats. You can select more impulse feats with kineticist class feats, and at higher levels, you'll automatically get more with the gate's threshold class feature. You can select an impulse feat only if it matches one of your kinetic elements.</p>\n<p>Impulses are magical, and though they aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect impulses. Abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells) also apply to impulses.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Levels</strong></h3>\n<p>Any impulse you use is the same level you are. For instance, if you're 5th level, your Elemental Blast would be 5th level (and its counteract rank would be 3rd rank), even though you gained the action at 1st level.</p>\n<p>Similar to spells, many impulses get more powerful as you increase in level. In these cases, the impulse ends with one or more \"Level\" entries. This either lists the levels at which the impulse gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level impulse with a \"Level (+4)\" entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Attacks and DCs</strong></h3>\n<p>An impulse that requires a saving throw uses your kineticist class DC. Some of your impulses require you to attempt an <strong>impulse attack roll</strong> to see how effective they are. Your impulse attack roll uses the same proficiency and attribute modifier as your kineticist class DC. Like a spell attack modifier, your impulse attack modifier uses the following formula: d20 roll + attribute modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. This means your impulse attack roll is typically 10 lower than your class DC. The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained] condition can reduce your impulse attack rolls and class DCs. You can acquire a <em>gate attenuator</em> to gain a bonus to your impulse attack modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Elemental Blast</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Elemental Blast] impulse is a simple expression of your power, allowing you to attack with the pure matter of your kinetic element. Though each element has its own strengths and weaknesses, the basic principles to using them are the same. You can customize the appearance of your Elemental Blast and can even choose a different form each time you use the impulse.</p>\n<h3><strong>Base Kinesis</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Base Kinesis] impulse lets you perform simple alterations to an element.</p>\n<h2>Kineticist Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a kineticist class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Extract Element<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Creatures with a strong tie to your element might be troublesome for you to deal with, at least until you've learned to turn their elemental nature to your advantage. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Extract Element] action.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Will Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Your mental defenses grow stronger. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Gate's Threshold<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You reach a new milestone in your odyssey to become in tune with your kinetic gate and must decide how to expand the gate's power. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you choose to either expand the portal or fork the path.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Expand the Portal</strong>: Your gate attunes more precisely to one of your elements. Gain an impulse feat of your level or lower for one of your kinetic elements; if you have more than one element, you can choose a composite impulse. You also gain a gate junction for one of your kinetic elements. If you have no valid options for the feat-typically because you have one kinetic element and devoted your class feats to gaining that element's impulses-you can instead select any kineticist class feat of your level or lower for which you meet the prerequisites.</li>\n<li><strong>Fork the Path</strong>: Your gate reaches to another elemental plane. Add a new element of your choice to your kinetic elements. Gain an impulse feat of your level or lower with the trait of that element. You can't select a composite impulse feat with this feat selection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Gate Junctions</strong></h3>\n<p>When you gain a gate junction, you develop a specialized kinetic technique. Choose one benefit from the gate junction table for one of your kinetic elements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>critical blast</strong> junction happens when you get a critical success with an Elemental Blast of the kinetic element.</li>\n<li>An <strong>elemental resistance</strong> grants you resistance to damage while your kinetic aura is active. This resistance is equal to your level, and it applies to damage of any listed type or that comes from a creature or effect that has any of the listed traits.

You can always choose not to use a gate junction when it would normally occur. If you have multiple junctions that would apply at the same time - such as kinetic aura junctions for different elements - you can apply any number of them.

You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a magus, you can draw replacement sigils with the tip of your weapon or your free hand for spells requiring material components, replacing them with somatic components instead of needing a material component pouch. At 1st level, you can prepare one 1st-rank spell and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below). Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a magus, your number of spell slots and the highest rank of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 2-2: Magus Spells per Day. Because you split your focus between physical training and magical scholarship, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest rank and, if you can cast 2nd-rank spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 rank lower than your highest spell rank. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest rank of spell you can cast as a magus. For example, as a 1st-level magus, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level magus, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h3>Spellbook</h3>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of eight arcane cantrips and four 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be anything from a sturdy book with a secure latch entitled Theses on the Stratagems of Supernatural Warfare to a tattered collection of training pamphlets with your name scrawled on the cover.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two more arcane spells to your spellbook, of any rank of spell you can cast. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures. Though you lose some lower spell slots as you increase in level, you keep the spells in your spellbook and can prepare them in your higher-rank slots as normal.</p>\n<p>If you have a spellbook from multiple sources (such as being a magus with the Wizard Dedication feat), you can use the same spellbook for all your spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The studious spells class feature gives you extra slots of this rank for specific spells.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spellstrike</h2>\n<p>You've learned the fundamental magus technique that lets you combine magical and physical attacks together. You gain the Spellstrike activity.</p>\n<h3>Spellstrike Specifics</h3>\n<p>Though the base Spellstrike rules cover most spells, various modifications apply to more complicated spells when loaded into your fist, blade, or other attack.</p>\n<p><strong>One Target</strong> The spell targets only the target of your Strike, even if it normally allows more targets. Some feats let you affect more creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Reach</strong> The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack you make your Spellstrike with. For instance, shocking grasp would affect a creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with reach, and ray of frost would affect only a creature in your weapon's reach, even though the spell's range is longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Ancillary Effects</strong> Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, acid splash would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and tanglefoot's circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Defenses</strong> Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a disintegrate spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones.</p>\n<p><strong>Invalid or Immune Target</strong> If the target you hit wouldn't be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn't affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it can still be affected by the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Variable Actions</strong> Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take exactly 1 or 2 actions; you can't use Spellstrike with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Metamagic</strong> You typically can't use metamagic with Spellstrike because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.</p>\n<h2>Arcane Cascade</h2>\n<p>After you wield magic, you can enter a special stance to make your attacks more effective.</p>\n<h2>Hybrid Study</h2>\n<p>Your extensive physical training and carefully chosen magic combine to form a unique and dangerous fighting style that's more than the sum of its parts. You choose one field of hybrid study to represent your particular combination of skills. Your hybrid study gives you a special ability, usually tied to Spellstrike or Arcane Cascade, and it determines your initial conflux spell. The hybrid studies presented in this book are as follows.</p>\n<h3>Inexorable Iron</h3>\n<p>Once you begin along a path, nothing can stop you from reaching its end. You transform the mass of a greataxe, greatsword, or polearm into an unstoppable force to augment your own striking power or keep you standing on the battlefield. When you enter Arcane Cascade stance and at the start of each of your turns while you're in that stance, if you're wielding a melee weapon in two hands, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to half your level (minimum 1 temporary HP).</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> thunderous strike</p>\n<h3>Laughing Shadow</h3>\n<p>Magic is freeing, a means to your ends, and you can use it to go where you want, do as you please, and avoid the consequences. You are a laughing shadow of spell and blade, always one step ahead of your foes, always with a trick up your sleeve.</p>\n<p>While in Arcane Cascade stance, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds, or a +10-foot bonus if you're unarmored. If you have a free hand while in the stance and are attacking an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] creature, you increase the extra damage to 3, to 5 if you have weapon specialization, or to 7 if you have greater weapon specialization. You must have your other hand completely free; the extra damage doesn't apply if you have a free-hand weapon or other item in that hand, even if you would normally be able to use the hand for other things.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> dimensional assault</p>\n<h3>Sparkling Targe</h3>\n<p>You've studied the applications of magic, training yourself to perform not just offensive maneuvers but defensive tactics as well. When magic flows through you, your shield can block impossible things, even a dragon's breath or a magic missile.</p>\n<p>You gain the Shield Block general feat.</p>\n<p>When you're in Arcane Cascade stance with your shield raised, your circumstance bonus to AC from your shield also applies to your saves against spells and other magical effects. In addition, damage you take as a result of a spell or magical effect while you're in Arcane Cascade can trigger your Shield Block reaction, even if the damage isn't physical. When blocking damage in this way, increase your shield's Hardness by an amount equal to the extra damage from Arcane Cascade (typically 1, but 2 if you have weapon specialization, or 3 if you have greater weapon specialization). These benefits apply whether you're using an actual shield, the shield spell, or something else that works like a shield (such as a raised tome if you have the Raise a Tome feat).</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> shielding strike</p>\n<h3>Starlit Span</h3>\n<p>With magic, the sky's the limit, and you can't be bound by the confines of physical proximity. Your power reaches as far as your senses can perceive, transcending the space between you and your target even with spells that normally require direct physical contact.</p>\n<p>When you use Spellstrike, you can make a ranged weapon or ranged unarmed Strike, as long as the target is within the first range increment of your ranged weapon or ranged unarmed attack. You can deliver the spell even if its range is shorter than the range increment of your ranged attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> shooting star</p>\n<h3>Twisting Tree</h3>\n<p>The staff is perhaps one of the simplest of weapons, but this simplicity belies its elegance and versatility. To you, a staff is casting implement and martial weapon alike-the foundation of a fighting style.</p>\n<p>While you wield a staff in one hand, the staff adjusts in shape and weight, gaining the agile trait and increasing its damage die size to 1d6. While you wield a staff in both hands, it lengthens, twists, and reshapes, gaining the parry, reach, and trip traits. While you're in Arcane Cascade stance, you can Interact or Release to change your grip on the weapon as a free action when you Strike with your staff, including Strikes made in a Spellstrike. This happens before you roll your attack roll. You can also Interact to change your grip on the staff as a free action triggered at the end of your turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> spinning staff</p>\n<h2>Conflux Spells</h2>\n<p>You learn a conflux spell from your hybrid study, and you can cast additional conflux spells by selecting certain feats. Conflux spells are magus-specific spells created for combat and are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to both study your spellbook and perform a physical regimen.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points.</p>\n<h2>Magus Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a magus class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Attribute Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Studious Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your hybrid study grants you additional spells that can enhance your power in combat. You gain two special 2nd-rank studious spell slots, which can be used to prepare spider climb, true strike, water breathing, and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. You add any spells from this class feature to your spellbook. At 11th level, the extra slots increase to 3rd rank and you add haste and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. At 13th level, the extra slots increase to 4th rank and you add fly and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study.</p>\n<p><strong>Laughing Shadow</strong> 7th: mirror image; 11th: shift blame; 13th: dimension door</p>\n<p><strong>Sparkling Targe</strong> 7th: resist energy; 11th: warding aggression; 13th: stoneskin</p>\n<p><strong>Starlit Span</strong> 7th: darkvision; 11th: wall of wind; 13th: freedom of movement</p>\n<p><strong>Inexorable Iron</strong> 7th: enlarge; 11th: earthbind; 13th: dimensional anchor</p>\n<p><strong>Twisting Tree</strong> 7th: magic mouth; 11th: slow; 13th: blink</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You can inflict greater injuries with your favored weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your fundamental understanding of magic improves, making your spells harder to resist. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to defend yourself better against incoming attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to a wide range of ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You fortify your spells with masterful prowess. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to avoid blows. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmed defense, increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Double Spellstrike<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You can extend the magic of spells you store with Spellstrike. After you make a Spellstrike with a spell cast from a spell slot, you retain an echo of the spell, stored in your body. The next time you Spellstrike, you can cast the same spell again without expending a spell slot.</p>\n<p>If you choose to cast a different spell with Spellstrike, or you go 1 minute without using the stored spell, the stored spell dissipates harmlessly.</p>",

You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Metal Strikes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You can adjust your body to make unarmed attacks infused with the mystic energy of rare metals. Your unarmed attacks are treated as cold iron and silver. This allows you to deal more damage to a variety of supernatural creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.</p>\n<h2>Monk Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your proficiency rank for your monk class DC increases to expert. If you have ki spells, your proficiency rank for spell attacks and spell DCs with the tradition of magic you use for your ki spells increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Second Path to Perfection<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to find perfection in every success. Choose a different saving throw than the one you chose for your path to perfection. Your proficiency rank for the chosen saving throw increases to master. If you roll a success with the chosen saving throw, you instead critically succeed.</p>\n<h2>Graceful Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You move with perpetual grace in battle, eluding and turning aside blows. Your proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Master Strikes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your skill in using your body as a weapon. Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks and simple weapons increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Third Path to Perfection<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You have made great progress in your personal studies of enlightenment. Choose one of the saving throws you selected for path to perfection or second path to perfection. Your proficiency rank for the chosen type of save increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on the chosen type of save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on the chosen type of save against an effect that deals damage, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Adamantine Strikes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>When you focus your will into your limbs, your blows are as unyielding as the hardest of metals. Your unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine.</p>\n<h2>Graceful Legend<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your sublime movement grants you unparalleled protection and offense. Your proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to legendary, and your proficiency rank for your monk class DC increases to master. If you have ki spells, your proficiency rank for spell attack rolls and spell DCs with the tradition of magic you use for your ki spells increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Perfected Form<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have purged incompetence from your techniques. On your first Strike of your turn, if you roll lower than 10, you can treat the attack roll as a 10. This is a fortune effect.</p>",

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Divine Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your mystery provides you with divine magical power. You can cast spells using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Cast a Spell] activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Your unconventional access to this divine power means you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a material component pouch when casting spells.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can cast up to two 1st-rank spells per day. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as an oracle, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2-3: Oracle Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. To cast a heightened spell, you must have the heightened version in your repertoire; for example, you can't cast a 3rd-rank version of a spell that is only in your repertoire at 1st rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest rank of spell you can cast as an oracle. For example, as a 1st-level oracle, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level oracle, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* Your oracular class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the divine spell list, or from other divine spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2-3), you add a spell of the same rank to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<p><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></p>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Mystery</h2>\n<p>An oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine being. This power could come from a potent concept or ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous conduit to raw divine power. This is the oracle's mystery, a source of divine magic not beholden to any deity.</p>\n<p>Choose the mystery that empowers your magic. Your mystery grants you special spells called revelation spells and might later grant you divine domain spells. It dictates the effects of your oracular curse, adds an additional cantrip to your repertoire, and gives you one or more trained skills. Drawing insight and power from the collective divine influences that fuel your magic also provides you with a special benefit.</p>\n<p>The following oracle mysteries are presented in this book.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Ancestors]: Voices of past generations teach and haunt you.</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Battle]: You embody the virtues upheld by heroes of legend.</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bones]: Death always seems near, and the dead speak to you.</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Cosmos]: You draw power from the stars and the spaces between.</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Flames]: You dance with fire and do your best to remain unscorched by it.</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Life]: The teeming energies of life flow through you out into the world.</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Lore]: You gain access to unparalleled, overwhelming knowledge.</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Tempest]: Wind, waves, and storms rage at your beck and call.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Revelation Spells</strong></p>\n<p>The powers of your mystery manifest in the form of revelation spells, which are a type of focus spell. Casting a revelation spell costs 1 Focus Point and increases the effects of your oracular curse. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Refocus] activity to reconcile the conflicting or unconventional nature of your divine mystery.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>Revelation spells have the cursebound trait, unlike other focus spells. This trait means they increase the severity of your oracular curse (see below) when cast. You can't cast a cursebound spell if you don't have an oracular curse.</p>\n<p>You learn two revelation spells at 1st level. The first is an initial revelation spell determined by your mystery. The second is an initial domain spell you select from one of the domains associated with your mystery, which you cast as a revelation spell, causing it to gain the cursebound trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Oracular Curse</strong></p>\n<p>Drawing on multiple disparate sources of power inevitably places an incredible stress on your body, manifesting as a supernatural curse. The more revelation spells you cast, the worse the effects of your curse, but these increasingly conflicting energies can also provide you with divine benefits.</p>\n<p>The specific effects of your curse are tied to your mystery, but all curses follow the same progression. A curse continually gives you a mild but constant reminder that you carry otherworldly power. As you cast revelation spells, your curse intensifies, first to a minor effect and then to a moderate effect.</p>\n<p>Your curse progresses to its minor stage the first time you finish casting a revelation spell after your daily preparations. Once your minor curse has manifested, it remains in effect until you rest for 8 hours and again make your daily preparations. If you cast a revelation spell while your minor curse is in effect, you progress to the moderate curse effect immediately after you finish Casting the Spell. The minor effect continues to affect you, though some moderate curse effects might alter the specifics of your minor curse. At higher levels, you can cast more revelation spells, progressing your curse to its major stage and then an extreme stage; these stronger curses are cumulative with the effects of the lower stages and can alter them. When you Refocus while under the effects of your moderate or stronger curse, you reduce your curse's severity to minor in addition to regaining a Focus Point.</p>\n<p>Drawing upon your mystery's power while your curse is at its worst causes an irreconcilable conflict between you and the sources of your power. Immediately after casting a revelation spell while under the moderate effect of your curse, you are overwhelmed. While overwhelmed, you can't Cast or Sustain any revelation spells-you effectively lose access to those spells. You can still Refocus to reduce the effects of your curse and regain a Focus Point, but doing so doesn't allow you to cast further revelation spells. These effects last until you rest for 8 hours and make your daily preparations, at which point your curse returns to its basic state. At higher levels, you can grow to withstand your curse's major and even extreme effects, enabling you to cast more revelation spells without becoming overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>Your curse has the curse, divine, and necromancy traits. You can't mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your oracular curse by any means other than Refocusing and resting for 8 hours. For example, if your curse makes creatures @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Sure Strike] (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Cleanse Affliction] and similar spells don't affect your curse at all.</p>\n<h2>Oracle Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain an oracle class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can replace it with any spell you could have chosen when you first selected it (i.e., of the same spell rank or lower). You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Attribute Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>The intricacy of your divine power has grown clearer over time. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Major Curse<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to better balance the conflicting powers wreaking havoc on your body. Immediately after completing the casting of a revelation spell while you are affected by your moderate curse, your curse progresses to its major effect, rather than overwhelming you. This effect lasts until you Refocus, which reduces your curse to its minor effect. If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of your major curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse.</p>\n<p>In addition, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool from 2 to 3. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You truly understand the deep and complex divine power within your mystery. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Extreme Curse<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You have mastered a perilous balance between the conflicting divine powers of your mystery, gaining the power to change your fate, but straining both body and soul. When you cast a revelation spell while affected by your major curse, your curse intensifies to an extreme effect instead of overwhelming you. All mysteries share the same effects for their extreme curse.</p>\n<p>When affected by your extreme curse, you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed]{Doomed 2} (or increase your doomed condition by 2 if you were already doomed). Once every 10 minutes, when you fail an attack roll, skill or Perception check, or saving throw, you can reroll it and use the second result. The reroll has the fortune trait and doesn't require you to spend an action, meaning you can use the reroll even if you can't act. These effects are in addition to all the effects of your major curse, and they can't be removed by any means until you Refocus to reduce your curse to its minor effect.</p>\n<p>If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of this extreme curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse, and you remain doomed 2 even if you Refocus.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you spend at least 3 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 3 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Greater Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You can harness divine power at a level few others can match. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Oracular Clarity<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You now fully grasp the nature of the divine power behind your mystery, allowing you to work magic akin to miracles. Add two common 10th-rank divine spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using oracle spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Oracular Providence] feat to gain a second slot.</p>",

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p><h2>Psychic Spellcasting</h2><p>You access the vast well of power that resides within your own mind, calling forth psychic magic with nothing but thought and will. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You alter some of the standard spell components when casting spells you know from your psychic spellcasting. Instead of speaking, you substitute any verbal components with a special mental component determined by your subconscious mind class feature. This represents how you exert your mind toward your intended effect. Any of these components impart the concentrate trait to the spell you're casting. You also substitute any material components with somatic components, though these tend to be simple movements of the hand or head compared to those used by other spellcasters. Your spells still have clear and noticeable visual and auditory manifestations, as normal for a spellcaster.</p><p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-rank spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p><p>As you increase in level as a psychic, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Psychic Spells per Day.</p><p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is determined by your subconscious mind, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use the modifier for the attribute stated in your subconscious mind.</p><h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest rank of psychic spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level psychic, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level psychic, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><p>As a psychic, you get the ability to improve some of your cantrips with special benefits and psi amps. Over the course of your career, your choice of conscious mind class feature gives you extra cantrips, benefits and psi amps for cantrips, and a collection of unique psi cantrips.</p><h2>Spell Repertoire</h2><p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-rank occult spell of your choice and three occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. Your choice of conscious mind also grants you additional spells in your repertoire, starting with an additional 1st-rank spell and two cantrips listed in your conscious mind, which you cast as psi cantrips (see below).</p><p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-rank spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell. Your conscious mind also adds additional spells to your repertoire as you gain spells of higher ranks.</p><p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, such as the spells you gain from your conscious mind, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p><h3><strong>Swapping Spells in your Repertoire</strong></h3><p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><caption>Psychic Spells per Day</caption><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>3*</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1†</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>3*</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2†</td></tr><tr><td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\"><p>* Your conscious mind gives you three additional cantrips with amps. One cantrip is unique to your conscious mind.</p><p>† The infinite mind class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Psi Cantrips and Amps</h2><p>The magic of your mind manifests as psi cantrips, which you can modify by spending Focus Points. Like other cantrips, you can cast psi cantrips as often as you like, and they are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Your psi cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list as part of your psychic spellcasting. Generally, only feats can give you more psi cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out psi cantrips gained from psychic feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining. At 1st level, you learn three psi cantrips determined by your choice of conscious mind; one is a unique psi cantrip and two are common cantrips, typically from the occult spellcasting tradition, that you always cast as psi cantrips. You automatically gain more psi cantrips as you progress in your career as a psychic.</p><p>You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. However, unlike other spellcasters, you don't gain focus spells that cost Focus Points to cast. Instead, you use your Focus Points to boost or modify your psi cantrips by applying amps—specialized thoughtforms that alter the expression of your psychic power. Each of your psi cantrips has a special amp heading. Whenever you cast a psi cantrip, you can amp it by spending 1 Focus Point to add the amp effect. You can also gain additional amps through feats, allowing you to substitute a psi cantrip's normal amp effect for another one. You choose which amp to use, if you choose to use any, each time you cast a psi cantrip. Unless otherwise noted, you can apply only one amp to a given psi cantrip.</p><p>You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain Focus Points by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to explore your mind, whether via meditation, practicing a craft or activity that gives you the mental space to self-reflect, or talking through your thoughts and feelings with yourself or another. If you've spent Focus Points only to amp psi cantrips or fuel psychic abilities since the last time you Refocused, you regain 2 Focus Points when you Refocus, up to your maximum of 2. If you've spent Focus Points on focus spells or abilities other than those from the psychic class (for instance, to cast a focus spell you gained from an archetype), you regain only 1 Focus Point.</p><h2>Unleash Psyche</h2><p>When one thins the barrier between their inner mind and the outer world, one can unleash true psychic power. However, the mind wasn't meant to tap its full strength for long, leading to backlash once your unleashed psyche ends.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Unleash Psyche]</p><h3>Subconscious Mind</h3><p>A psychic's power is born in the depths of their psyche, far from the surface. Your subconscious mind might represent the way your power comes to you naturally, or it may be a framework you use to safely access the infinite potential of your mind. Either way, your subconscious mind fundamentally shapes how you access and wield psychic magic. Choose a subconscious mind from the options starting on page 15, or options from other sources to which you have access. This choice will determine your key attribute, special spellcasting components you use, and an action you can take while you have Unleashed your Psyche. The following options are presented in this book.</p><p><strong>Emotional Acceptance (Cha):</strong> Throwing yourself headlong into your emotions is what lets you access your power.</p><p><strong>Gathered Lore (Int):</strong> Tutors taught you specific axioms and lessons to help you harness your mind.</p><p><strong>Precise Discipline (Int):</strong> Meticulously aligning your thoughts brings your mental power into reality.</p><p><strong>Wandering Reverie (Cha):</strong> Your imagination fuels your magic through instinct and free association.</p><h3>Conscious Mind</h3><p>Whatever the subconscious source of a psychic's power, all find that a specific external manifestation of their magic comes most easily to them. This conscious outward expression adds several additional spells to your spell repertoire and grants you three psi cantrips. Two of these cantrips are common spells, though you gain an extra benefit with them that other spellcasters don't get, and the last is unique to your conscious mind. You also get two more unique psi cantrips at higher levels. Choose a conscious mind from the options starting on page 16, or options from other sources to which you have access.</p><p>The following options are presented in this book.</p><p><strong>The Distant Grasp:</strong> Manipulate physical objects with telekinesis.</p><p><strong>The Infinite Eye:</strong> Observe the world and weaponize your knowledge.</p><p><strong>The Oscillating Wave:</strong> Redistribute thermal energy to create blazing heat and bone-chilling cold.</p><p><strong>The Silent Whisper:</strong> Tap into the thoughts of those around you to soothe or influence.</p><p><strong>The Tangible Dream:</strong> Weave your imagination into creations of force and light.</p><p><strong>The Unbound Step:</strong> Bend and traverse space with teleportation and phasing.</p><p>Specific spells you learn come from your conscious mind, which shapes the raw psychic power from your subconscious into the forms and phenomena that you intentionally cast. You select your conscious mind at 1st level, and it detemines the following.</p><p><strong>Granted Spells </strong>You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, in addition to those you gain through psychic spellcasting. At 1st level, you gain a 1st-rank spell, and you learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast psychic spells of that rank, learning the 2nd-rank spell at 3rd level, the 3rd-rank spell at 5th level, and so on.</p><p><strong>Standard Psi Cantrips </strong>These are two common cantrips you automatically gain at 1st level. While these are the same cantrips used by other spellcasters, you cast them as psi cantrips, enabling you to amp them for greater effect. Your mastery of psychic magic also grants you a passive benefit that applies every time you cast these cantrips, even when you haven't amped them. These benefits apply only with cantrips you gain from your conscious mind; you would cast a cantrip you gained with your psychic spellcasting class feature, for example, as normal even if it appears in a different conscious mind.</p><p><strong>Unique Psi Cantrips</strong> These psi cantrips are unique to your conscious mind. You automatically gain the surface psi cantrip at 1st level, automatically gain the deeper psi cantrip at 6th level, and automatically gain the deepest psi cantrip at 10th level.</p><h2>Psychic Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a psychic class feat.</p><h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p><h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p><h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>You've learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p><h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p><p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p><h2>Attribute Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p><p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p><h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p><h2>Clarity of Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>Your deepening connection to your mind grants you more power to fuel your psi amps. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. This ability doesn't change the number of Focus Points you regain when you Refocus. As normal, this ability can't increase the size of your focus pool above 3 points.</p><h2>Precognitive Reflexes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>Minor precognition ensures you can react to threats slightly before they occur. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p><h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Self-reflection has brought you greater knowledge of yourself and, with it, psychic power. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p><h2>Great Fortitude<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2><p>Your mind holds your body to a subconscious mental image of yourself. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p><h2>Extrasensory Perception<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>Minor applications of clairvoyance let you know when danger is near. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p><h2>Walls of Will<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>Your practiced mind resists external influence. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you succeed at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p><h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>Training and magic have improved your weapon technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p><h2>Personal Barrier<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>Subtle telekinetic fields dampen and deflect incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p><h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>As you touch a weapon, you glimpse the hands that made and wielded it, teaching you how to inflict greater injuries. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p><h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>You've gained access to the deepest corners of your own mind. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p><h2>Fortress of Will<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2><p>Your trained mind is as a fortress that none can breach. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you critically fail a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p><h2>Infinite Mind<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>Anything you can imagine is now within the realm of possibility. Add two common 10th-rank occult spells to your repertoire; you gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using psychic spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the Mind over Matter psychic feat to gain a second slot.</p><h2>Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>As your training reaches its peak, you understand not just your own mind, but the collective unconscious from which all psychic power stems. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>",

This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose them from, additional spells you learn, and additional trained skills. You also gain Focus Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. The bloodlines presented in this book are as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bloodline: Aberrant]{Aberrant}</strong> A strange and unknowable influence gives you occult spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bloodline: Angelic]{Angelic}</strong> Holy grace bestows divine spells upon you.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bloodline: Demonic]{Demonic}</strong> A sinful corruption gives you divine spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bloodline: Diabolic]{Diabolic}</strong> A bond with devils gives you divine spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bloodline: Draconic]{Draconic}</strong> The blood of dragons grants you arcane spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bloodline: Elemental]{Elemental}</strong> The power of the elements manifests in you as primal spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bloodline: Fey]{Fey}</strong> Influence from the fey gives you primal spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bloodline: Genie]{Genie}</strong> Through lineage, magic, or wishes made real, the blood of a noble genie flows through your veins.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bloodline: Hag]{Hag}</strong> The blight of a hag has given you occult spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bloodline: Imperial]{Imperial}</strong> An ancient power grants you arcane spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bloodline: Nymph]{Nymph}</strong> One of your ancestors was inspired by a nymph, or perhaps was a nymph themself, and now the beauty of nature lives in you.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Bloodline: Psychopomp]{Psychopomp}</strong> For good or ill, your ancestors' deeds drew the attention of psychopomps, or you might somehow count one in your family tree.

Bloodline spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don't need to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules can be found here.</p>\n<h3>Reading A Bloodline Entry</h3>\n<p>A bloodline entry contains the following information:</p>\n<p><strong>Spell List</strong> You use this magical tradition and spell list.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Skills</strong> You become trained in the listed skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Granted Spells</strong> You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, as described in the Spell Repertoire class feature. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a 1st-rank spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that rank.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Spells</strong> You automatically gain the initial bloodline spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the Advanced Bloodline and Greater Bloodline feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Blood Magic</strong> Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using Focus Points or a granted spell from your bloodline using a spell slot, you gain a blood magic effect. If the blood magic offers a choice, make it before resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects and, against a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references to spell rank refer to the rank of the spell you cast.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sorcerer Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3-17: Sorcerer Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest rank of spell you can cast as a sorcerer. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3-17), you add a spell of the same rank to your spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new rank of spells, your first new spell is always your bloodline spell, but you can choose the other spells you gain. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new bloodline spell and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already have so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Swapping Spells in your Repertoire</h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sorcerer Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a sorcerer class feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Attribute Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Alertness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've improved your combat skill. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Defensive Robes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>The flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to inflict grave wounds with your most practiced weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled you mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Bloodline Paragon<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-rank spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, and they can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Bloodline Perfection] sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to legendary.</p>",

Magic also flows through this conduit from your eidolon into you, so your eidolon determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose from (as described in Summoner Spellcasting on page 54).</p>\n<p>Choose a type of eidolon from the options starting on page 59 and other eidolons you have access to. When you choose your eidolon, you also determine its appearance and general form, within the parameters for that particular type of eidolon. Once you establish your eidolon's type and general appearance, these features can't be changed later, except by selecting special evolution feats that can cause your eidolon to develop new features.</p>\n<p>Your magical connection with your eidolon takes the form of a sigil on each of your bodies. As long as your eidolon is manifested, the sigil glows with light and can't be covered or disguised via any means; it will shine through clothing, appear over cloaks, and remain unaffected by obfuscating magic. This, combined with the way that the two of you clearly act in tandem, makes it readily apparent to an intelligent observer that the two of you are connected in some way, even if the person has never encountered a summoner before.</p>\n<p>You bring your eidolon into reality with the Manifest Eidolon action.</p>\n<p>Your eidolon is no mere minion. It doesn't have the minion or summoned trait, and the two of you work together and coordinate your actions. You and your eidolon share your actions and multiple attack penalty. Each round, you can use any of your actions (including reactions and free actions) for yourself or your eidolon.</p>\n<p>You coordinate your actions with your eidolon more efficiently when you Act Together. Your connection with your eidolon allows you to communicate with it telepathically at all times, even when it isn't manifested. You also gain the Share Senses action.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the connection between you and your eidolon means you both share a single pool of Hit Points. Damage taken by either you or the eidolon reduces your Hit Points, while healing either of you recovers your Hit Points. Like with your actions, if you and your eidolon are both subject to the same effect that affects your Hit Points, you apply those effects only once (applying the greater effect, if applicable). For instance, if you and your eidolon get caught in an area effect that would heal or damage you both, only the greater amount of healing or damage applies.</p>\n<h3>Gear and your Eidolon</h3>\n<p>Your eidolon can't wear or use magic items, except for items with the eidolon trait. An eidolon can have up to two items invested. Your eidolon's link to you means it can benefit from certain magic items invested by you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your eidolon gains item bonuses to Perception and skills from any magical items that you have invested.</li>\n<li>Your eidolon increases its item bonus to AC based on your armor's armor potency rune or bracers of armor. It also gains an item bonus to its saves from the resilient rune on your armor or from your bracers of armor. Other permanent items that grant or increase item bonuses to AC and saves might convey a similar benefit, as determined by the GM.</li>\n<li>Your eidolon's Strikes benefit from the fundamental and property runes on your handwraps of mighty blows. Alternatively, you can Invest a magic weapon (even though magic weapons can't normally be Invested) to share its fundamental and property runes with your eidolon. You share these benefits only while you're holding the weapon, and you can have no more than one weapon invested in this way at a time. In either case, the eidolon gains only the benefits that can apply to its attacks, with the same limitations noted in handwraps of mighty blows.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lost and Altered Actions</h3>\n<p>If you or your eidolon becomes slowed, stunned, quickened, or otherwise affected by something that changes the actions you gain at the start of each turn, it affects your shared actions. However, if you are both subject to such an effect, apply only the more severe one. For instance, if you or your eidolon were @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 1}, you would start your turn with one fewer action, but if you were both slowed 1, you would still lose only one action, rather than adding the two slowed effects together. However, if you were slowed 1 and your eidolon @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 2}, you'd have two fewer actions, because that's the more severe effect. If only one of you becomes restricted in how you can spend your actions, that restriction doesn't automatically extend to the other; for example, if your eidolon became @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] or petrified, it wouldn't be able to move, but you could still use your actions to move. The GM resolves any situation that's unclear.</p>\n<p>You, as the player, control both your summoner and your eidolon, and the two are generally considered to cooperate unless you decide for them not to. While a summoner's link with an eidolon is a partnership, ultimately the eidolon is linked to you, not the other way around. If there's ever a conflict of who should act, you win out over your eidolon. This means that if the eidolon comes under an effect that would take its actions out of your control, such as the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Confused] or controlled condition, you can use all of your shared actions so your eidolon doesn't have any actions remaining to cause trouble (as long as you are able to act). However, if you came under such an effect, you would simply use all of your shared actions, preventing your eidolon from acting.</p>\n<h2>Summoner Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your link to your eidolon grants you limited magic connected to your eidolon's nature. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because of the magic you draw from your eidolon, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need a material component pouch.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-rank spell and five cantrips. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a summoner, the magical link with your eidolon grants you additional, more powerful spell slots. Your total number of spell slots and the highest rank of spells you can cast are shown in Table 2-4: Summoner Spells per Day. Because of the way you draw magic from your connection to your eidolon, you begin to lose lower-rank spell slots once you reach 5th level. The maximum number of spell slots you get from the summoner class is four, starting when you reach 4th level.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447 of the Core Rulebook.</p>\n<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>\n<p>When you gain spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest rank of spell you can cast as a summoner. For example, as a 1st-level summoner, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level summoner, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h3>Spell Repertoire</h3>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your eidolon, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it doesn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2-4: Summoner Spells per Day), you add a spell of the same rank to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell. At 3rd level, you add the first 2nd-rank spell to your repertoire. At 4th level you gain your second and your spell repertoire reaches its maximum size of five spells.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, in addition to adding two 3rd-rank spells to your repertoire, you lose your lowest rank of spell slots. Any time you lose a rank of spell slots, you lose two spells in your repertoire as well. These can come from spells you already know or out of the number of new spells you're learning. On levels in which you don't change your spell slots, you can swap out multiple spells, as described below.</p>\n<h3>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. If it's a level at which you lose a set of lower-rank slots, you can replace the two in either order. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<p>At 6th level and every even level thereafter, you can swap out any number of your spells for different spells of a rank you can cast. When you do, you must keep at least one spell you can cast with your lowest rank of spell slots so you don't end up with slots you can't use. For instance, at 6th level you would need to keep at least one 2nd-rank spell, but all your other spells could be 3rd rank.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Link Spells</h2>\n<p>Your connection to your eidolon allows you to cast link spells, special spells that have been forged through your shared connection with your eidolon. Link spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to specifically connect with your eidolon, such as by having a heart-to-heart conversation, playing together, or meditating in unison on the nature of your bond.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear on page 300 of the Core Rulebook.</p>\n<p>You learn the evolution surge link spell, which allows you to grant your eidolon one of several useful benefits.</p>\n<h3>Link Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Link cantrips are special link spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like. Link cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from your tradition's spell list. Generally, only feats can give you more link cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out link cantrips gained from summoner feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining.</p>\n<p>You learn the boost eidolon link cantrip, which briefly improves your eidolon's capabilities, allowing it to attack with greater power.</p>\n<h2>Evolution Feat</h2>\n<p>Evolution feats are a special type of summoner class feat that allow you to customize your eidolon through your shared link. You gain an evolution feat for your eidolon at 1st level, representing the differences that make it unique from other eidolons of its type. If you retrain this feat, the feat you replace it with must also be an evolution feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Summoner Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a summoner class feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Shared Vigilance<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You and your eidolon work together to remain alert to threats around you, allowing you to perceive far more together than you could individually. Your proficiency rank in Perception and your eidolon's proficiency rank in Perception increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Unlimited Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>All of your spells are signature spells. That means that if you know a spell, you can heighten it freely by casting it from a higher-rank spell slot, up to the maximum rank of spell you can cast. You can similarly cast any of its lower-rank versions without learning them separately.</p>\n<h2>Attribute Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<p>Your eidolon also gets four attribute boosts at these levels. The eidolon's attribute boosts follow the same rules as yours.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Eidolon Unarmed Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Your eidolon becomes more capable of using its unarmed attacks. Its proficiency rank for unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Eidolon Symbiosis<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your connection with your eidolon strengthens, granting your eidolon access to a new ability depending on its type, as described in Eidolon Abilities in each eidolon's entry.</p>\n<h2>Eidolon Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your eidolon has learned how to inflict greater injuries with its unarmed attacks. It deals 2 additional damage with unarmed attacks in which it's an expert. This damage increases to 3 if it's a master, and 4 if it's legendary.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>As your connection to your eidolon deepens, the power of your spells increases. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your eidolon's tradition increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Shared Reflexes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You and your eidolon boost each other's reflexes, allowing you both to roll away from danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves and your eidolon's proficiency rank for Reflex saves increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Eidolon Defensive Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your eidolon increases its ability to avoid attacks. Its proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Simple Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Training and magic improved your weapon technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Twin Juggernauts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You and your eidolon fight off physical hardship together with your shared life force. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves and your eidolon's proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increase to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead. When your eidolon rolls a success on a Fortitude save, it gets a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Defensive Robes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>The flow of magic around you increases your ability to avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Eidolon Unarmed Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your eidolon truly masters its unarmed attacks, reaching greater heights. Its proficiency rank for unarmed attacks increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Greater Eidolon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your eidolon's damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with unarmed attacks in which it's an expert, 6 if it's a master, and 8 if it's legendary.</p>\n<h2>Shared Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You and your eidolon steel your mind together against effects that threaten you, each protecting the others' minds from danger. Your and your eidolon's proficiency ranks for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. When your eidolon rolls a success on a Will save, it gets a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Eidolon Transcendence<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your connection with your eidolon approaches its peak, granting your eidolon access to a powerful new ability depending on its type, as described in Eidolon Abilities in each eidolon's entry. This ability also increases one of the eidolon's attributes by +1.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your connection to your eidolon is strong enough to grant you mastery over associated spells. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your eidolon's tradition increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Eidolon Defensive Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your eidolon's form becomes particularly difficult to assail. Its proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Instant Manifestation<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You can manifest your eidolon with incredible speed. You can use Manifest Eidolon as a single action, instead of a three-action activity.</p>",

You dart among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Key Attribute: DEXTERITY</strong></p>\n<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Dexterity.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>\n<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Roleplaying the Swashbuckler</h1>\n<h2 class=\"title\">During Combat Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Panache</h2>\n<p>You care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular bravado, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This state of flair is called panache, and you are either in a state of panache or you are not.</p>\n<p>You gain panache by successfully performing the skill check associated with specific actions that have a bit of flair, including @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Tumble Through] and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler's style (see below). At the GM's discretion, after succeeding at a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you also gain panache if your result is high enough (typically the very hard DC for your level, but the GM can choose a different threshold).</p>\n<p>While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Tumble Through or to take any actions that give you panache due to your style. The precise strike class feature also causes you to deal extra precision damage while you have panache. Powerful finisher actions, including @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Confident Finisher], can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache.</p>\n<p>Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Swashbuckler's Style</h2>\n<p>As a swashbuckler, you have your own distinctive style that enables you to gracefully handle everyday events and life-or-death situations alike. Choose a swashbuckler's style. This style determines the additional actions you use to gain panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that action. The styles presented in this book are as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Battledancer]</strong> To you, a fight is a kind of performance art, and you command your foes' attention with mesmerizing motions. You are trained in Performance and gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Fascinating Performance] skill feat. You gain panache during an encounter when the result of your Performance check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Perform] exceeds the Will DC of an observing foe, even if the foe isn't @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fascinated].</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Braggart]</strong> You boast, taunt, and psychologically needle your foes. You are trained in Intimidation. You gain panache during an encounter whenever you successfully @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Demoralize] a foe.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Fencer]</strong> You move carefully, feinting and creating false openings to lead your foes into inopportune attacks. You are trained in Deception. You gain panache during an encounter whenever you successfully @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Feint] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Create a Diversion] against a foe.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Gymnast]</strong> You reposition, maneuver, and bewilder your foes with daring feats of physical prowess. You are trained in Athletics. You gain panache during an encounter whenever you successfully @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Grapple], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Shove], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Trip] a foe.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Wit]</strong> You are friendly, clever, and full of humor, always knowing just what to say in any situation. Your witticisms leave foes unprepared for the skill and speed of your attacks. You are trained in Diplomacy and gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Bon Mot] skill feat. You gain panache during an encounter whenever you succeed at a Bon Mot against a foe.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Precise Strike</h2>\n<p>You strike with flair. When you have panache and you Strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2 additional precision damage. If the strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead.</p>\n<p>As your swashbuckler level increases, so does your additional damage for precise strike. Increase the amount of additional damage on a Strike and the number of additional dice on a finisher by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Confident Finisher</h2>\n<p>You gain an elegant finishing attack you can make when you have panache. You gain the Confident Finisher action.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Swashbuckler Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a swashbuckler class feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Great Fortitude<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Your physique is incredibly hardy, granting you increased endurance. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Opportune Riposte<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You turn the tables on foes who fumble, capitalizing immediately on their mistake. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Opportune Riposte] reaction.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Stylish Tricks<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you gain a skill feat. This feat must be for Acrobatics or the trained skill from your swashbuckler's style.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Vivacious Speed<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>When you've made an impression, you move even faster than normal, darting about the battlefield with incredible speed. Increase the status bonus to your Speeds when you have panache to a +10-foot status bonus; this bonus increases by 5 feet at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels. When you don't have panache, you still get half this status bonus to your Speed, rounded down to the nearest 5-foot increment.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Attribute Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all weapons for which you have expert proficiency.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Evasion<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, a dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Exemplary Finisher<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You execute your finishing moves with spectacular flair, adding special effects to your finishers. If a Strike you make as part of a finisher hits a foe, you add one of the following effects to the Strike, depending on your swashbuckler's style.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Battledancer</strong> You can Step as a free action immediately after the finisher.</li>\n<li><strong>Braggart</strong> If the foe was temporarily immune to your Demoralize, their temporary immunity ends.</li>\n<li><strong>Fencer</strong> The foe is off-guard until your next turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Gymnast</strong> If the foe is grabbed, restrained, or prone, you gain a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to twice the number of weapon damage dice.</li>\n<li><strong>Wit</strong> The foe takes a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Swashbuckler Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You perform swashbuckling techniques with exceptional flair, making them harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your swashbuckler class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Continuous Flair<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>While not equal to the heights of your panache in combat, you have a dramatic flair about you in any situation. Whenever you succeed at a check during exploration that would have granted you panache in combat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to further checks for actions that would grant you panache in combat. This benefit ends when the exploration changes to a different scene (as determined by the GM) or shifts to an encounter or downtime.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Improved Evasion<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your ability to elude danger is matchless. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Keen Flair<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You inflict particularly devastating attacks on even well-defended foes. When you Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack with which you have master proficiency, if you roll a 19 on the die and the roll is a success, you critically succeed instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Eternal Confidence<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>As a swashbuckler at the peak of your skill, you swell with confidence and bravado in every attack. Your proficiency rank for your swashbuckler class DC increases to master.</p>\n<p>When you Strike as part of a finisher or Opportune Riposte, you can give the Strike the failure effect from the Confident Finisher action, including the increase from Precise Finisher if you have that feat. You can do so only if the Strike uses a weapon or unarmed attack that you could use for Confident Finisher.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Light Armor Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.</p>",

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Lore</h2>\n<p>Your experience with the unknown, as well as the tales you've exchanged with other thaumaturges, has taught you about strange phenomena of every kind. You become trained in Esoteric Lore, a special lore skill that can be used to Recall Knowledge regarding haunts, curses, and creatures of any type, but that can't be used to Recall Knowledge of other topics. Unlike a normal Lore skill, you use Charisma as your modifier on Esoteric Lore checks. You also gain the Dubious Knowledge skill feat.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you become an expert in Esoteric Lore; at 7th level, you become a master in Esoteric Lore; and at 15th level, you become legendary in Esoteric Lore.</p>\n<h2>First Implement And Esoterica</h2>\n<p>Your implement is a special object of symbolic importance: your badge as you treat with the supernatural and a powerful tool if things turn violent. Choose an implement from the options presented on page 36 (amulet, bell, chalice, lantern, mirror, regalia, tome, wand, and weapon). You begin play with a mundane item of that type, and you gain the initiate benefit for that implement. While an implement is useful to you, it typically has no value if sold. If you acquire a new object of the same general implement type, you can switch your implement to the new object by spending 1 day of downtime with the new item. As you advance as a thaumaturge, you will collect up to three implements and unlock the hidden potential stored within each, so you can mix and match their benefits to suit your situation.</p>\n<p>While your implements are your primary tools in your dealings with the supernatural, you know the value of always being prepared. You constantly collect and carry various smaller mystic objects, bits of materials with paranormal affinities, and items used in folk practices: your esoterica. These might include cold-iron nails, scraps of scrolls and scriptures, fragments of bones purportedly from a saint, and other similar objects. You keep your esoterica in easy-to-access places on your person and are well practiced in brandishing your implement and esoterica together, so you can draw and use esoterica with the same hand you're using to wield an implement.</p>\n<h3>Exploit Vulnerability</h3>\n<p>Exploit Vulnerability</p>\n<p>You gain the Exploit Vulnerability action.</p>\n<h2>Implement's Empowerment</h2>\n<p>The power of your implement can also be turned to the more common task of combat, its power adding to and amplifying the effects of runes and other magical empowerments. When you Strike, you can trace mystic patterns with an implement you're holding to empower the Strike, causing it to deal 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Channeling the power requires full use of your hands. You don't gain the benefit of implement's empowerment if you are holding anything in either hand other than a single one-handed weapon, other implements, or esoterica, and you must be holding at least one implement to gain the benefit.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturge Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a thaumaturge class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Attribute Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Second Implement<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've added another implement of power to your toolkit. You choose a second implement, which must be a different type of implement than your first. You gain the initiate benefit of your new implement.</p>\n<p>While you're holding an implement in one hand, you can quickly switch it with another implement you're wearing to use an action from the implement you're switching to. To do so, you can Interact as a free action immediately before executing the implement's action. This allows you to meet requirements of having an implement in hand to use its action. For example, if you had your lantern implement in one hand, a weapon in the other, and a chalice implement you were wearing, you could swap your lantern for your chalice to use its reaction.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturge Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned the secret ways your weapons work most effectively. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and martial weapons increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Implement Adept<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You have deepened your connection to one of your implements, unlocking its adept power. Choose one of your implements and gain the adept benefit for that implement.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Intensify Vulnerability<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to use your implement to further assault a creature whose vulnerabilities you're exploiting. You gain the intensify vulnerability benefit of all of your implements, as well as the Intensify Vulnerability action.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturgic Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned deeper secrets of the supernatural, and your abilities are harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your thaumaturge class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<p>You also gain an additional skill increase, which you can apply only to Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Second Adept<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've improved your link to your second implement. You gain the adept benefit of your second implement.</p>\n<h2>Greater Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead.

Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to a wide range of ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Third Implement<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>As you come closer to the culmination of your journey, you gain your final implement, completing your set of three. It must be a different type of implement than your first and second implements. You gain the initiate benefit and intensify vulnerability benefit of your new implement.</p>\n<h2>Implement Paragon<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You have unlocked the last secrets of an implement. Choose one of your implements that already gained the adept benefit; you gain the paragon benefit for that implement.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturgic Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've become a master in paranormal phenomena, and your esoterica grow in power.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Patron</h2>\n<p>You weren’t born with the power to cast spells, nor have you spent years dedicated to worship, study, or uncovering mystical secrets. Your magic instead has been gifted to you by a potent being, one who knows that by empowering you so, you’ll further the being’s agenda in the world, whatever it may be. This entity is typically mysterious and distant, revealing little of their identity and motivations. They make their will known to you in abstract signs such as omens, dreams, or similar subtleties rather than words.</p>\n<p>Rather than interacting with you directly, your patron works through a familiar—a mystical creature that teaches you, serves as the conduit for your patron’s magic, and maybe even keeps an eye on you to ensure you’re furthering your patron’s nebulous ends.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, choose your patron, which determines your spellcasting tradition and grants you the skill for that tradition of magic, your first witch’s lesson and a unique familiar ability.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Witch Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Using your familiar as a conduit, your patron provides you the power to cast spells. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of your patron’s tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a witch, when you cast spells, your incantations might rhyme, your gestures might be as simple as an ominous pointing finger or a complex folk sign, and your familiar might even echo your words or movements slightly as your patron’s magic surges.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells your familiar knows. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a witch, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Witch Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd-rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell’s rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The patron conduit class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of witch spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witch, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level witch, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells</p>\n<h3><strong>Familiar</strong></h3>\n<p>Your patron has sent you a familiar, a mystical creature that teaches you magic and facilitates your spells. Though as it’s a direct conduit between you and your patron, it’s more powerful than typical familiars. Your familiar gains two additional familiar abilities: one of these is a unique ability based on your patron and is always selected, and the other is an additional familiar ability that can be selected daily as normal. Your familiar gains another extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels</p>\n<p><strong>Spells:</strong> Your familiar is the source and repository of the spells your patron has bestowed upon you, and you must commune with your familiar to prepare your spells each day using your witch spellcasting. Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-rank spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron’s initial lesson. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Spells:</strong> Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition’s spell list by physically consuming a written version of that spell over the course of 1 hour. This can be a scroll of that spell, or you can prepare a written version using the Learn a Spell exploration activity. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch’s familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition’s spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar’s patron. You can’t prepare spells from another witch’s familiar.</p>\n<p><strong>Undying</strong>: If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless. Your familiar’s death doesn’t affect any spells you have already prepared.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Hexes</h2>\n<p>As a favored agent of your patron, you can invoke their power for a more direct magical intervention. A hex is a spell shaped by your patron and sent to you through your familiar, rather than an ability you use directly. Your patron expects you to advance its interests and does not take kindly to repeated requests for aid; as such, you can use only one hex each turn, and any attempts to use a second hex on that turn fail and the actions are lost.</p>\n<p>Hex spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with your familiar. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips.</p>\n<p>Focus spells don’t require spell slots, and you can’t cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear in on page 298.</p>\n<p>You learn your choice of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Patron's Puppet] hex or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Phase Familiar] hex, which let you command your familiar or defend it from harm, respectively. You learn most other hexes from witch lessons.</p>\n<p><strong>Hex Cantrips</strong></p>\n<p>Hex cantrips are special hexes that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still cast only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with your witch spellcasting and aren't counted toward your prepared cantrips. You gain a hex cantrip determined by your choice of patron.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Witch Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a witch class feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Attribute Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Your patron’s power boosts your physical resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to better control the power your patron has granted you. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Reflex Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast, helping you to avoid danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Perception Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Through sheer experience, you've improved your technique with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Defensive Robes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>The flow of magic through your spellcasting and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve achieved mastery over your patron’s magic. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Will of the Pupil<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Communion with your familiar has steeled your mental fortitude. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve perfected your command of the magic your patron provides. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Patron's Gift<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your patron grants you the power to command incredible works of magic. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can’t use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don’t gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Patron's Truth] feat to gain a second slot.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Patrons</h2>\n<p>When your patron first makes contact, they usually reveal little more of themself than glimpses or specific manifestations—you might see eyes from the shadows of the forest or hear a wordless voice echoing across the frozen tundra before your familiar makes itself known. Your patron's true identity might be a powerful hag, a fey lord, a deity or demigod, an archdevil, or a similarly powerful entity, or perhaps multiple such figures working in tandem, but that identity is for you to attempt to discover as you learn more of your patron's lessons. Some patrons are multifaceted, appearing in different guises, and granting different powers to different witches. In some cases, the witch may know of their patron's identity, but have some other aspect shrouded in uncertainty; they might know their patron's name but not motive, or perhaps even if they know the patron's identity, they have been cursed to never reveal it to others.</p>\n<p>Your patron determines the following.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell List</strong> You use this magical tradition and spell list;</p>\n<p><strong>Patron Skill</strong> You become trained in the skill associated with your patron's magical tradition.</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Lesson</strong> This is the first lesson your patron teaches you and is unique to your patron.</p>\n<p><strong>Familiar Ability</strong> One of your familiar's two bonus abilities is always the one listed here, a mark of your patron's indelible influence.

You treat magic like a science, cross-referencing the latest texts on practical spellcraft with ancient tomes to discover and understand arcane magic.

If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Wizard Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Through dedicated study and practice, you can construct spells with academic rigor by shaping arcane magic. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school (page 196). Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell’s rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h3><strong>Spellbook</strong></h3>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less (page 292), which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook’s form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Tome of Silent Shadows</em> or something more academic, like <em>Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory</em>.</p>\n<p>The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school).</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to and learn via Learn a Spell. When you gain spell slots of a new rank, you also add an additional spell from your school’s curriculum (unless it’s the school of unified magical theory).</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The Archwizard's Spellcraft class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Arcane Thesis</h2>\n<p>During your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research on one of a variety of topics.

At 1st level, you choose your arcane school, which grants you magical abilities.</p>\n<p>You gain additional spells and spell slots from the curriculum taught at the school you attended. Some wizards follow the school of unified magical theory, which attempts to forge a new school by studying independently and drawing information from a multitude of texts and tutors. Though a wizard with this approach lacks the focus of formal training, they have greater flexibility.</p>\n<p>Your arcane school is where you devoted yourself to the study of spellcraft. Whether you learned in the storied halls of a formal institution, via an apprenticeship with an archmage, or taught yourself from secondhand tomes, your arcane school indelibly set the curriculum and direction of your magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Curriculum Spells:</strong> You automatically add some of the spells listed in your school's curriculum to your spellbook. At 1st level, you add a cantrip and two 1st-rank spells of your choice. As soon as you gain the ability to cast wizard spells of a new rank, choose one of the spells from your curriculum of that rank to add to your spellbook. A superscript \"U\" indicates an uncommon spell. Your GM might allow you to swap or add other spells to your curriculum if they strongly fit the theme.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Slots:</strong> Each day, you can prepare an extra cantrip from your curriculum. You also gain an extra spell slot at each spell rank for which you have wizard spell slots. You can prepare only spells from your school's curriculum in these extra slots. Any spell listed in your curriculum of a suitable spell rank is eligible to be prepared in each of these extra slots, regardless of how you added the spell to your spellbook.</p>\n<p><strong>School Spells:</strong> School spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to study your spellbook or conduct arcane research.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points.</p>\n<p>You learn the initial school spell, which is unique to your school. You can learn the advanced school spell with the Advanced School Spell feat.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Ars Grammatica]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Battle Magic]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of the Boundary]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Civic Wizardry]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Mentalism]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Protean Form]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.School of Unified Magical Theory]</p>\n<h2>Arcane Bond</h2>\n<p>You place some of your magical power in a bonded item. Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item.

You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action.</p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Drain Bonded Item] <span class=\"action-glyph\">F</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You haven't acted yet on your turn</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You expend the power stored in your bonded item.

You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using wizard spellcasting.
