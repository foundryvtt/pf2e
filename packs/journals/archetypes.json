Or in a pinch, with trebuchets, siege towers, catapults, hwachas, and all other lethal miscellanea of a combat engineers' corp. As a true artillerist, you leave the penny-ante pistols and knives to those who only need to operate on a small scale. You're a consummate professional in the art of big guns, a maestro at merging mathematics and manpower to transform whatever castle wall, infantry battalion, or rampaging dragon offends you into a smoking crater in the ground.</p><p>You're not just some daredevil demolitionist, though. You're part of a team, accustomed to coordinating with your unit to maximize your time and effectiveness. Whether jumping in to help your crew load the next round, quickly calculating the trajectory of the engine's next shot, or taking the shot yourself, your presence on the team ensures their chances of success are maximized, creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p><section class=\"info\"><h4>Leading with a Cannon</h4><p>A proper artillerist is more than an engineer, though their skills in that field certainly shouldn't be underestimated. When a war becomes unavoidable, the presence of knights and pikemen might decide a skirmish or battle, but a well-trained artillerist with a reliable squad and a few good siege weapons can make the difference between prolonged months of battle with countless lives lost and a shorter, less bloody affair with fewer deaths and a more lasting victory.</p><p>Castles and fortifications are critical tools for holding land in a world full of empires, kingdoms, and duchies all vying for power. Many wars are won or lost not based on the military might of either side, but on a castle's ability to withstand an extended siege. Without a team of engineers capable of penetrating a castle or keep's defenses, the occupants can wait out an invading force for as long as they have enough food and water to keep their citizens and defenders healthy and fed. Many wars have been “won” when the besieged force manages to last through a single winter. Besieging armies whose supply lines break down due to snow-clogged passes or insufficient cold weather gear are forced to retreat due to losses from poor hygiene or hypothermia long before attrition has had an opportunity to impact their opponents.</p><p>An artillerist changes this dynamic, completely rewriting the rules of war. Rather than time being on the side of the besieged, it becomes the tool of the besieger. Each day that passes while a skilled artillerist hammers the castle walls with cannon fire and catapult stones brings the fortifications ever closer to crumbling down. Some wise nobles and warlords who realize their opponents have brought siege weapons, especially powerful black powder siege weapons like cannons, will choose to negotiate surrender before battle is even started, recognizing an inevitable defeat that can be staved off temporarily by sacrificing many soldiers but not thwarted without outside intervention.</p><p>Ruthless or evil artillerists, or the warlords they follow, might take things a step further, specifically targeting granaries to starve enemies out or launching rotting food, corpses, or diseased livestock into parts of the town near water sources. As food and water supplies dwindle, so too does the morale of the castle's inhabitants and defenders. Even a stubborn noble or warlord will find it hard to continue resisting a siege when their own troops mutiny and their citizens begin seeking a way out.</p></section><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Artillerist Dedication] Feat 2</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in martial weapons</p><hr /><p>Artillery is a team sport, where every member of the crew has to rely on the other members. At best, a mistake might just waste time. At worst, a misaligned fuse or a badly set pin could cause the whole thing to explode. You've taken these lessons to heart, and so your presence on an artillery team assists the entire team at every aspect of the siege weapon's deployment and usage. If you're serving on a siege weapon crew, you and all other members gain a +2 circumstance bonus to any checks to Load, Aim, move, or Repair the weapon. When you Aim a siege weapon, you can move the weapon's aim twice as far as normal.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained at least two other feats from the artillerist archetype.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Named Artillery] Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Crafting</p><hr /><p>It is a tradition among artillerists to name the siege weapon most important to them and closest to their heart—much as a sailor on a ship, the weapon is their livelihood. You've gone a step further, and you always make sure that your named artillery has the best possible maintenance and upkeep. You can spend a full day adjusting and working on a single siege weapon to designate it as your named artillery. The siege weapon you designated as your named artillery gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, Fortitude saves, and Reflex saves as well as additional Hit Points equal to twice your level.</p><p>During your daily preparations, you must spend at least one hour on maintenance to service your named artillery. If you fail to do so, or if you spend a full day designating a new piece of named artillery, the previous named artillery loses any benefits from this feat. Only one artillerist can designate a particular siege weapon as their named artillery, even if several artillerists are serving on the same siege weapon's crew (though it's typically more efficient for a group with several artillerists to divide them up, assigning one to each siege weapon).</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Shorthanded] Feat 4</h2><hr /><p>Typically, a siege weapon is meant to be run by a crew with a very specific minimum number of members designed to ensure that your crew can account for every possible variable and necessity in loading, aiming, and firing the weapon. In a pinch, however, you can operate it with fewer people, provided you know what you're doing. You can operate a siege weapon with fewer than the minimum number of crew, at an increasing penalty. You and your crew take a -2 penalty to checks to Load, Aim, Launch, move, or Repair the weapon for each person below the minimum crew. The maximum number of missing minimum crew members you can handle with this feat is 5. For example, if a siege weapon had a minimum crew size of 8, you would still need a crew of 3, and you would take a -10 penalty when doing so.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Cannon Corner Shot] Feat 6</h2><hr /><p>By loading special ammunition in a particular way, you can make your siege weapons do all manner of tricks that other siege engineers can barely even imagine. If you personally contribute an additional Load action to the siege weapon's loading, above the minimum, you can change a burst into a line twice as long as the size of the burst, or vice versa (so a 10-foot burst turns into a 20-foot line, or a 20-foot line turns into a 10-foot burst).</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Field Artillery] Feat 6</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Crafting</p><hr /><p>While castles are generally obliging enough to stay in one place, out in the field positioning is of paramount importance—a gun in the wrong place is worse than useless. You can Interact with an adjacent mounted siege weapon to increase its Speed by 10 feet for one round.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Live Ammunition] Feat 8</h2><hr /><p>There are generally few things as ill-advised as being shot out of a cannon or launched by a trebuchet, but people use the tactic every so often in a desperate situation. While it's more humane to use this strategy with mindless constructs or undead, occasionally an exceedingly foolhardy adventurer demands the opportunity to try it. Loading a creature requires two additional Load actions, which you must conduct personally. The creature must be willing, unconscious, or restrained throughout the process, and the siege weapon must be physically capable of firing the creature in question, based on their size and shape. Typically, that means ballistas don't qualify, for example—nor do auto-catapults which require specifically-sized balls—but normal catapults and onagers work just fine. When you Launch the weapon, if the weapon usually targets an area, you target a single 5-foot square instead. The siege weapon deals its normal damage to its target, or to the modified area, and to the creature fired.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Master Siege Engineer] Feat 16</h2><hr /><p>What you don't know about artillery isn't worth knowing and your mastery allows you to perform an impossible number of actions as part of a siege weapon's crew. You're permanently quickened. You can only use the extra action to Aim or Launch a siege weapon.</p>",

                "content": "<p><strong>Rarity</strong> uncommon</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The art of creating the weapons most commonly referred to as “beast guns” is truly ancient, with the first iterations of the weapons created on the continent of Arcadia well over 10,000 years ago. This means that beast guns predate all other forms of firearm crafting in Arcadia, even the legendary star guns, whose secrets have been lost to the ages. The tradition of designing beast guns has persisted throughout Arcadia well into the modern era, though it has become increasingly rare as the proliferation of classic firearms and the prestige associated with star guns has allowed more people access to equivalent destructive power without the intense requirements behind crafting a beast gun. However, beast gunners remain virtually unknown outside of Arcadia.</p>\n<p>The art of bonding to a beast gun and gaining the full magic of a beast gunner is an extended ritual with multiple steps, beginning with the hunt. A person seeking to bond to a beast gun typically does so with a brand new weapon made after they hunt down the creature themselves. This involves telling the story of the hunt, the beast, and the weapon created from the hunted creature. Finally, the weapon is carefully modified and tailored to ensure a proper bond between the beast gun and the prospective beast gunner. However, it's also possible to bond to an heirloom beast gun passed down through the generations by adding symbolic fresh components from the same kind of creature, after performing the same ritual hunt necessary to forge a new weapon with the intent of establishing a bond.</p>\n<p>To perform the ritual the prospective beast gunner must first plan a hunt to slay the creature corresponding to the beast gun, whether they wish to bond with a brand new beast gun or establish a link to an old beast gun. Typically, these ritualized hunts can include up to five assistants plus hunting beasts like canines or birds who help corner the beast and bring it down. If the assistants are significantly more powerful than the hunted creature, or if there are so many assistants the creature never stood a chance at survival, the magic simply fails during the bonding process and the hunt and organic materials are wasted, usually much to the shame and chagrin of the hunter. The same doesn't apply if the prospective beast gunner hunts the creature alone, even if they are significantly more powerful than the creature, such that the creature never stood a chance against them in a one on one fight.</p>\n<p>You're one of those who successfully completed the hunt and bonded with your prized weapon. Now, you seek to discover the hidden depths that others who think they know how to use beast guns can only imagine.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Choosing Your Beast Gun</h4>\n<p>A beast gunner's bond with their beast gun is deep and mystical, so if you hope to be a successful beast gunner, it's important to choose a beast gun that suits your temperament, magic, and combat style. For example, if you favor strength and intimidation, a screech shooter is the right choice for you, whereas a spider gun might be optimal if you prefer a more careful style of setting up the battlefield in advance. Similarly, a tentacle cannon is slow and methodical and can hold an enemy in place at close range, while a drake rifle is energetic and mobile and can be used to attack from a great distance. Each beast gun has a personality and magical abilities that attract people who value them. For this reason, some experienced beast gunners say the weapon chooses you.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Beast Gunner Dedication] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert with at least one type of firearm, you own a beast gun and have slain the type of creature associated with your beast gun in a fair hunt (see above); trained in Arcana and Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've bonded to your beast gun and unlocked the first hints of its hidden potential.

As a beastmaster, it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time-up to four companions-but only one of those companions, your \"active companion,\" follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal companion from the Beastmaster archetype, you also gain @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Call Companion] to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the beastmaster archetype or from another source.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Beastmaster Dedication] Feat 2</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Nature</p><hr /><p>You gain the service of a young animal companion that travels with you and obeys your commands. Contrary to the usual rules for animal companions, this feat can grant you a second animal companion. If you ever have more than one animal companion, you gain the Call Companion action. See the Beastmaster Animal Companions sidebar for details on this action.</p><p>Certain beastmaster feats give you primal focus spells. When you gain your first beastmaster focus spell, you become trained in primal spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma. Feats that grant beastmaster focus spells tell you to increase the number of Focus Points in your pool, but if you don't already have a focus pool, you instead get a focus pool with 1 Focus Point. You can Refocus by grooming, feeding, playing with, or otherwise tending to an animal companion.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the beastmaster archetype.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Additional Companion] Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Beastmaster Dedication</p><hr /><p>Another animal joins you in your travels. It is a young animal companion that has the minion trait. See Beastmaster Animal Companions for rules on how having multiple animal companions works.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat more than once, gaining an additional animal companion each time, to a maximum of four total companions (including the one you gained from Beastmaster Dedication and possibly one you gained from sources other than the beastmaster archetype).</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Heal Animal] Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Beastmaster Dedication</p><hr /><p>You can heal your animal companion's wounds. You can cast heal animal as a beastmaster focus spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Mature Beastmaster Companion] Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Beastmaster Dedication</p><hr /><p>All of your animal companions grow up, becoming mature animal companions and gaining additional capabilities. During an encounter, even if you don't use the Command an Animal action, your animal companion can still use 1 action on your turn to either Stride or Strike.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Beastmaster's Trance] Feat 6</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Beastmaster Dedication</p><hr /><p>You can enter a trance that allows you to briefly inhabit the body of one of your animal companions and share its senses. You gain the focus spell beastmaster trance. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Incredible Beastmaster Companion] Feat 8</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Mature Beastmaster Companion</p><hr /><p>Your mature animal companions continue to grow and develop. They each become nimble or savage animal companions (your choice, choose for each companion, including those that become mature after you take this feat), gaining additional capabilities determined by the type of companion.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Beastmaster Bond] Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Beastmaster Dedication</p><hr /><p>You can communicate telepathically with your animal companions within 100 feet. If you're legendary in Nature, you can communicate telepathically with your animal companions anywhere on the planet.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Beastmaster's Call] Feat 12</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Beastmaster Dedication, Call Companion</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per turn</p><hr /><p>You quickly call in a primal projection of a non-active companion to provide the companion's support benefit. The projection arrives in an unoccupied square of your choice within 30 feet of you, grants you its support benefit, and then disappears on your next turn. The projection has the same AC and saving throw modifiers as the real companion, and if it would take any damage before your next turn, it disappears and the support benefit ends immediately.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Specialized Beastmaster Companion] Feat 14</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Incredible Beastmaster Companion</p><hr /><p>Your nimble and savage animal companions become cunning enough to become specialized. Each companion gains one specialization of your choice (choose separately).</p><p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat more than once. Each time, add a different specialization to your nimble and savage companions. Your nimble and savage companions can have up to three specializations each.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Lead The Pack] Feat 16</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Mature Beastmaster Companion, you chave multiple animal companions</p><hr /><p>You can have up to two animal companions active at once. However, when you do, it's slightly more difficult to Command them. If you don't Command either of your companions, one of the two (your choice) can still use 1 action on your turn to Stride or Strike, as per Mature Beastmaster Companion, but not both. When you Command an Animal, either choose one of the companions to take 2 actions, as normal, or else both companions can take 1 action to Stride or Strike. Either way, you can't Command an Animal to make either companion act again until your next turn.</p>",

The GM might determine that a different AC is appropriate or that a particular effect isn't a valid option, such as using the explosive barrel option when there's no such object on the battlefield. The GM should inform you if a Trick Shot is feasible before you spend your actions, since your trained eye can easily recognize loose or volatile objects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dislodge Object</strong> Your attack knocks an unattended object of no more than 2 Bulk out of position, moving it up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice.

Perhaps this comes from a touch of fey or draconic blood in your family's distant past, or perhaps it's the work of some special boon or curse placed upon you.</p>\n<p>Captivators come from all areas of the world and all walks of life. A farmhand with the right gifts, sent to the market every week to hawk their latest crop, could find themself on the path to becoming a captivator. An urchin who relies on the sympathy of others just to survive may become a captivator out of necessity, and a noble, immersed in a deadly game of luxury and influence, might have trained to be a captivator since birth.

You and your mount are an unparalleled team, moving with shared intent to become a powerful force on the battlefield. You might wield a banner in the name of a greater organization, a liege, or an ideal you uphold, or you might fight solely to further enrich your own prestige, reputation, and coffers.</p>\n<p><strong>CAVALIER PLEDGES</strong></p>\n<p>Many cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific organization or individual, such as a noble family or sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization, or a particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid's animal order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema, you should work with your GM to determine the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge. Cavaliers who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier's Banner. If you violate the anathema of your pledge, you lose access to those feats until you benefit from an atone ritual. Changing the subject of your pledge is equivalent to retraining a class feature.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:1.5em\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Cavalier Dedication] Feat 2</span></p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Nature or Society</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You gain a young animal companion that serves as your mount. You can choose from animal companions with the mount special ability, as well as any additional options from your pledge, as determined by your GM. You must choose an animal companion that's at least one size larger than you, but if the animal usually starts as Small, you can begin with a Medium version of that animal (changing no statistics other than its size).</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the cavalier archetype. This restriction is waived if you have pledged to the organization associated with the other dedication feat. For example, if you are pledged to a Hellknight order, you could take Hellknight dedication feats without needing to gain other feats from the cavalier archetype first.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Cavalier's Banner] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Cavalier Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have pledged your service to a specific organization or ideal (see Cavalier Pledges sidebar).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You fly the banner of your pledge from your mount, raising your allies' spirits.

Use your own AC against the triggering attack instead your mount's AC. If the triggering attack hits, you take the effects of the attack instead of your mount.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Mounted Shield] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Cavalier Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've trained with your shield to defend both yourself and our mount. When you Raise a Shield while mounted, both you and your mount gain the shield's circumstance bonus to AC.

Your mount deals damage equal to the melee Strike using its legs to each creature whose space you move through, subject to a basic Reflex save against your mount's Athletics DC. On a critical failure, the creature also becomes flat-footed until the end of your next turn.

                "content": "<p>The rippling waves of fear, the rustling of thick scales, and the beat of immense wings signal the arrival of a great dragon. The awe-inspiring presence of these creatures makes them worthy of reverence-or even outright worship. Dragon disciples dedicate themselves to becoming like these great beasts, with each disciple striving to typify one variety of dragon. Sorcerers of draconic blood, barbarians with the dragon instinct, and many kobolds with close ties to their draconic predecessors become dragon disciples, but anyone who has encountered one of these terrifying creatures might follow this path.</p>\n<p>As a dragon disciple, you study and learn from the example of dragons, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you admire the dragons you emulate. While most dragon disciples do indeed revere their chosen dragon, countless tales are told of dragon disciples born of great personal tragedy at the hands of boundless draconic fury. These disciples have transformed themselves into what they despise in order to gain the power to destroy their draconic tormentor and at long last earn their revenge.</p>\n<p><strong>INSTINCT OF THE WYRM</strong></p>\n<p>The acquisition of draconic might can change the dragon disciple's body and give them magical abilities, as reflected in the archetype's feats, but the mind often changes as well, potentially even overwhelming the disciple's normal personality. Any dragon disciple can find the attitudes of dragonkind intruding into their thoughts. The foremost emotion among all types of dragons is pride. Even the influence of a benevolent metallic dragon can overwhelm a dragon disciple with pride. When tempered, this feeling levels out to a steady confidence, but when uncontrolled, it can grow to an air of arrogance or superiority.</p>\n<p>Disciples of metallic dragons also feel the pangs of compassion and benevolence. They grow to be more focused on cooperation and might take on leadership roles. Disciples of the vile chromatic dragons are plagued by thoughts of cruelty and greed. They long to see fear in the eyes of foe and friend alike. Those who succumb to these thoughts become bullies or tyrants.</p>\n<p>Instinctual draconic feelings can be constant, yet they seem to intensify when the disciple uses their draconic powers. In the few seconds after using a breath weapon or attacking with claws, or when the disciple sprouts wings, they might have a moment of mental transformation. This can bring on the full mindset of a dragon, or even make the disciple temporarily believe they truly are a dragon, and is often accompanied by a draconic roar, cackle, or majestic display.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:1.5em\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Dragon Disciple Dedication] Feat 2</span></p>\n<p><strong>Access</strong> You are a kobold with the dragonscaled or spellscaled heritage, a dragon instinct barbarian, or a draconic bloodline sorcerer.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You choose to study or worship one type of dragon, and your focus grants you a measure of its power.

Once per day, you can cast 7th-level dragon form as an innate arcane spell, transforming into your chosen type of dragon. The spell automatically heightens to 8th level if you're 16th level and 9th level if you're 18th level. Any time you score a critical hit with an unarmed Strike gained from dragon form, you recharge the spell's breath weapon immediately.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Disciple's Breath] Feat 16</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Dragon Disciple Dedication, Dragon Breath sorcerer bloodline spell</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You unleash your breath weapon without spending focus. This has the effects of your dragon breath sorcerer bloodline spell, though it deals 9d6 damage instead of its usual damage, and you don't have to cast it or spend a Focus Point. You can't use Disciple's Breath again for [[/r 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Mighty Dragon Shape] Feat 18</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Shape of the Dragon</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've practiced and increased your draconic might, allowing you to take your draconic form more often.

You store these ghosts within a magical vessel called a spirit dwelling. This spirit dwelling might be a treasured family heirloom, an item you crafted expressly to help with exorcisms, or even just an odd trinket you found that happens to do the job.</p>\n<p>While the motivations of exorcists run the gamut, most are compassionate individuals who believe that every ghost, haunt, and spirit is simply a lost soul in need of rest. They collect spirits expressly for the purposes of offering them comfort, guidance, and absolution. After an exorcist's ministrations, these spirits are freed of their burdens, emotion, and regrets and are reabsorbed into the River of Souls. Although exorcists rarely gather in one place, many different religions employ them to deal with spiritual threats.</p>\n<p>Exorcists are most commonly found among the faithful of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Ashava] the True Spark (the empyreal lord of dancers), but among the major deities of the Inner Sea region, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Sarenrae], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Pharasma], and even @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Shelyn] count a fair number of exorcists among their faithful. Exorcists can come from any walk of life, but many are redeemer champions, clerics, or monks. Apart from the role of the spirit dwelling, exorcism practices can vary. For example, a bard or rogue might attract spirits with trickery, charm, or empty promises. In contrast, a cleric of Pharasma could take a more severe route, demanding the spirits return to the natural order of things.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats</strong> 8th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spiritual Sense]; 10th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Blind-Fight]; 14th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Sense Evil]; 16th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Sense The Unseen]</p>\n<section class=\"info\">SPIRIT DWELLINGS AND REMNANTS\n<p>A spirit dwelling can be any object, from an everyday item like a mirror, hand bell, or gemstone, to a custom clockwork device, so long as it can be held in one hand, is light Bulk, and doesn't serve another function (such as a weapon, shield, consumable, or magic item). Your spirit dwelling has the trait of the magical tradition used to take Exorcist Dedication and the necromancy trait. Your spirit dwelling is attuned to you, so only you can use it. If your spirit dwelling is lost or stolen, you can turn another object into a new spirit dwelling with a 1-hour ritual; this causes your previous spirit dwelling to revert to a mundane object and any spirits within to harmlessly disperse.</p>\n<p>Your spirit dwelling can house not just wisps but greater remnants of spiritual energy left behind by defeated ghosts and haunts. You can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Collect Spirit Remnant] activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Rejuvenating Spirits</strong>: Though all spirit wisps and most remnants can pass on immediately when purified, if a spirit remnant came from a creature with the rejuvenation special ability (such as most ghosts), a recurring haunt, or another entity who ordinarily doesn't pass on when destroyed, its ties to this world are too strong for it to easily pass on. When a spirit remnant from such an entity is released as part of your daily preparations, instead of joining the River of Souls, it begins re-forming itself in the time and location noted in its rejuvenation ability. However, you learn a clue about the spirit's unfinished business, which may help you put it to rest permanently.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"info\">EXORCISTS ACROSS GOLARION\n<p>The well-known exorcists of Pharasma use methods of repeated prayer, holy water, and sacred rituals. Ashavic exorcists often dance under the moonlight to entice lost souls and guide them onward. In Osirion, exorcists practice execration, or proactive preventive exorcism techniques. In Northern Garund and some parts of Qadira, playing the stringed tanbura, rattling manjur, and specific drum patterns help cut the threads that tie the spirit to this world. Matanji orcs in the Mwangi Expanse perform exorcisms by drawing tattoo-like diagrams in iron ink. In Tian Xia, exorcists often use fulus (Secrets of Magic 158) to assist in their practice.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Exorcist Dedication] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Occultism or Religion</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned to attract, quell, and purify spirits, housing them in a special receptacle called a spirit dwelling until they're ready to move on. Through the power of prayers or ritual incantations, one mundane object in your possession becomes a spirit dwelling (page 23). Your spirit dwelling functions as a lure for lost spirits weakened by their time on the Material Plane. Each day during your daily preparations, your spirit dwelling attracts a spirit wisp who comes to dwell inside. If your spirit dwelling contains no wisps, you can spend 10 minutes in a minor ritual to cast your spirit dwelling around an area and attract another wisp. You can also capture stronger spirit remnants from vanquished undead spirits, as explained in the sidebar on page 23. As long as your spirit dwelling contains any spirits, it glows faintly, casting dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p>\n<p>As an exorcist, you do more than just collect spirits: you also help rid them of their burdens and lingering resentments, aiding their transition from the Material Plane. Every day, before your daily preparations, any spirit wisps and remnants remaining within your spirit dwelling from the previous day are purified and can join the River of Souls in their final journey to Pharasma's Boneyard.</p>\n<p>You can also learn abilities that let you purify a spirit in your spirit dwelling immediately in a cathartic surge, granting you a helpful effect as they depart for the afterlife.

Select one creature you can see and declare a challenge. For your challenge, attempt a Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation check against that creature's Will DC. Your challenge must include a linguistic, auditory, or visual component and gains the corresponding trait.

A great boast uses the Firebrand Braggart Dedication action, except that if you succeed, your circumstance bonus increases to +2 and remains for 1 hour.

Once you declare a great boast about a particular action, you can't declare a great boast about the same action until the next time you make daily preparations, regardless of whether you succeed or fail at the check.

You narrate a tale of the hero's success, granting them a +2 circumstance bonus to their AC or saving throw against the triggering effect. If the villain has used the same effect against the hero on both of their last two turns, and you used Rule of Three on that effect last turn as well, the bonus increases to +4.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Communal Tale] Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Folklorist Dedication]</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Stories are an experience meant to be shared as a group.

The GM might determine an attunement applies as long as it's prevalent enough around you. For instance, you might be in aquatic terrain on a riverbank or on a boat.

Your mind, too, may have changed: though death can impact thoughts and desires in all sorts of ways, most ghosts experience stronger, more volatile emotions and are frequently overcome by their past ties. A need to reconcile the past overwhelms other needs. Motivations can change over time but are always strong. Pragmatism, compassion, and foresight fall before a ghost's fundamental desires.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:left\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ghost Dedication] Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> You died and returned as a ghost.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have risen as a shell of your former self, a spirit of mist and anguish. You gain the ghost, spirit, and undead traits, and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.Basic Undead Benefits]. Your undead craving is to settle your unfinished business. You also gain the incorporeal trait, as described on page 218, except you can't pass through solid objects unless you select the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pass Through] feat. Being a ghost has the following major effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Floating</strong> You can float but are still tethered to the ground. Replace your land Speed with an equal fly Speed. You can't rise more than a few inches above the ground when you Fly. This means you can move above many types of difficult or hazardous terrain without moving slowly or being damaged, even though you can't fly without limit. You can Leap, High Jump, Long Jump, and take similar actions, and use your fly Speed for any calculations that would normally require your land Speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Items</strong> You can transmute physical items to make them part of your incorporeal form. This requires spending 10 minutes with the items within reach, during which you transform the items into part of your form; you can return items you already have incorporated to a corporeal state at the same time. The items retain all their runes and other abilities, need to be invested normally if they have the invested trait, and need to be worn, held, or stowed appropriately. Once you've incorporated the items, you and other incorporeal creatures can use them normally—you can Interact with them, Release them, and so on. Your incorporated weapons gain the benefits of the ghost touch property rune, allowing you to use them normally against both corporeal and incorporeal creatures. Incorporated items become corporeal again only if you transmute them back or are destroyed, in which case, they drop to the ground under you.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks</strong> Your unarmed attacks become magical and deal negative damage instead of their normal type.</p>\n<p><strong>Strength</strong> Unlike most incorporeal creatures, your Strength modifier is not -5; you keep the same Strength score you had before you became a ghost, though you can only attempt Strength-based skill checks—typically Athletics checks—against other incorporeal creatures, as normal for an incorporeal creature. Against incorporeal creatures, use your Strength normally to determine the results of Athletics checks, Strikes with melee weapons, and any other checks or damage rolls dependent on Strength.</p>\n<p><strong>Ties that Bind</strong> When you become a ghost, work with your GM to choose a bound site and unfinished business, both of which matter for your character's story, as well as some ghost archetype feats. Your bound site tethers you to the physical world and is typically either a location important to you in life or the place where you died. Unfinished business keeps you from passing to the afterlife. If someone resolves your unfinished business, you decide whether to accept the change and pass on, or to fight it. If you pass on, you get a few minutes to say your goodbyes, and then move into the River of Souls and the afterlife. Your character ceases to be. If you fight the change, you remain, though you and the GM might determine a new unfinished business. If you are physically destroyed, you cease your existence as a ghost but still might not be able to pass on to the afterlife if your unfinished business is incomplete. In this liminal state, you might come across strange energies and become another sort of creature, or anchor to a summoner and become an eidolon.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Frightful Moan] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> Once per 10 minutes</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You lament your fate, forcing each living creature in a 30-foot emanation to attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune to Frightful Moans for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is frightened 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is frightened 2.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ghostly Resistance] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your ghostly form becomes innately weaker but also gains resistance to many forms of damage. Your maximum HP is reduced by your level. You gain resistance 1 to all damage except for force, positive, and any damage done by a weapon with the ghost touch rune (or any other source that acts like a ghost touch rune). This resistance increases to 2 if the source is non-magical. At 10th level, the resistance increases to 2, or 4 if the source is non-magical. At 16th level, the resistance increases to 3, or 5 if the source is non-magical.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ghostly Grasp] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your control over your ghostly form grows. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.Advanced Undead Benefits] and can interact with physical objects, with limits. You can attempt Strength-based skill checks against physical creatures and objects. You can Interact with physical objects, but the action has no effect unless you succeed at a DC 20 Athletics or DC 20 Thievery check.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ghost Flight] Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> Once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can suppress your tether to the ground, overcoming your resistance to fly free. For 10 minutes, your fly Speed doesn't restrict you to only a few inches off the ground, allowing you to travel to any height you choose.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pass Through] Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in Acrobatics, Ghost Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> Once per 10 minutes</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Filtering your form through the substance of an object, you can pass through walls, doors, and more. You Fly up to your Speed. During this movement, you can try to move through one object. Attempt an Acrobatics check as you try to enter its space. The DC is typically 30 to move through a wall of up to 5 feet, 15 for an ordinary door, and 10 for thinner structures like windows; the GM might set the DC higher for especially dense materials like adamantine or lead, or for barriers that are magically reinforced. You can't Pass Through an obstacle made of magical force, such as a wall of force.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You move through the object, treating the square within it as difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside an object, you can move out of it only if you Pass Through again or use some other means of moving through a solid object. As normal for being incorporeal, starting your turn inside an object makes you slowed 1 for that turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you moved out of the square you started in.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Rejuvenation] Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The call of your unfinished business recreates you after destruction. When you're destroyed, you reform after 2d4 days within your bound site, fully healed. If your unfinished business is resolved while you're waiting, you pass on immediately unless you and the GM determine you have new unfinished business.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Unlimited Ghost Flight] Feat 14</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Flight</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You put your connection to the material world farther behind you. Your fly Speed no longer restricts the height you can fly. When you use Ghost Flight, instead of its normal effect, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your fly Speed for 10 minutes.</p>",

While you can temper your hunger with long-dead flesh stolen from ancient graves, you much prefer devouring those who are freshly dead, whether as a scavenger or because you killed the creature yourself to ensure a fresh meal.</p>\n<p>Whether they stalk through the graveyards and crypts of Golarion or work together with other ghouls to build empires in the Darklands, ghouls care most about the consumption of dead flesh. The moment you become a ghoul, your existence focuses upon satisfying this endless craving. Ghouls who go more than a few days without feeding on freshly dead humanoid flesh find themselves in constant pain; those who go for more than a week might be driven to the edge of delirium, becoming bestial in their craving.</p>\n<p>When you succumb to ghoul fever and become a ghoul, you don't lose your mind or memories. You keep your personality only to have it warped by the never-ending need to consume flesh. A brave warrior remains brave, but under the curse of the fever, that brave warrior's prime directive is to consume flesh. A rogue might go from finding clever ways to pick pockets to finding ways to waylay opponents and devour them.</p>\n<p>Since most societies don't allow cannibalism, ghouls who wish to continue their old lives must satisfy their cravings in secret, finding a way to balance society's rules while feeding the constant gnawing hunger inside them. Some take up professions that allow them to secretly eat dead flesh or create dead bodies to feed upon. There are tales told of ghoul mercenary troops who satisfy their cravings and profit, while ghoul spellcasters can use their magic to procure and preserve flesh.</p>\n<p>Ghouls who won't restrain themselves with rules of the living may join or establish ghoul societies. These caste systems base their hierarchy on how much flesh one has consumed and can provide for other ghouls. Hunger and ambition drive ghouls to rise through the ranks, which allows them to feed their hunger even more.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats</strong>: 6th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Guarded Movement], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Reactive Pursuit]; 10th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Wall Run]</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:left\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ghoul Dedication] Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> You were killed by ghoul fever.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have succumbed to ghoul fever, dying and returning as a ghoul, an undead cursed with a never-ending hunger for dead flesh that slowly overrides your reason and willpower until you would do anything for the meal you crave. In addition to the personality changes, your body changes as well. Your ears become pointed, and your skin grows blueish and pale. Your fingernails sharpen into claws; your teeth become razor sharp, ready to tear flesh off the bone; and your tongue grows long and pointed.</p>\n<p>You gain the ghoul and undead traits and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.Basic Undead Benefits]. Your undead craving is for the flesh of dead creatures; freshly dead corpses from sapient creatures fulfill your cravings much more than non-sapient or rotted corpses, but any dead creature can stave off the hunger for at least a little while. You gain two unarmed attacks in the brawling weapon group. The first unarmed attack is a claw that deals 1d4 slashing damage with the agile and finesse traits, and the second unarmed attack is a set of jaws that deal 1d6 piercing damage and have the finesse trait.</p>\n<p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Consume Flesh]. Satisfying your craving is difficult. Consuming Flesh temporarily satiates you. Many ghoul feats have extra abilities or functions that can be used when you are satiated, though using those abilities also causes you to lose your satiated status. You can always Consume Flesh, but eating more than a normal amount has no further effect; a ghoul's hunger is satiated, or it is not.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Replenishing Consumption] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you devour corpses and satiate your hunger, you also recover from some of your wounds, your necrotized blue flesh knitting back together almost immediately as soon as you begin shoveling the chunks of dead flesh down your throat. Once every 10 minutes, when you Consume Flesh, you regain 1d6 Hit Points for every 2 levels you have, rounded up.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Swift Leap] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> GhoulDedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your undead physiology allows you to leap quickly toward or away from your opponent. You Leap. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.</p>\n<p>If you are satiated, you can choose to end your satiation to instead @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.High Jump] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Long Jump] without triggering reactions, as you take a quick, enormous jump before any foe can react to your movement.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Feverish Enzymes] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your claws and fangs exude an infectious enzyme, related to the necrotic effects of ghoul fever, that causes a creature's wounds to heal slowly. Strike with your claw or jaws. This attack deals negative damage instead of its normal type; on a hit, the target halves any healing it receives until the start of your next turn. The target or an adjacent ally can spend two Interact actions to squeeze the enzymes from the wound and remove the effect.</p>\n<p>If you are satiated, when you hit you can choose to end your satiation and boost your enzymes, increasing the duration to 1 minute.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Grave Strength] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The flesh you've consumed over the course of your existence as a ghoul has made you stronger, gifting you with strange insights from the minds of the sapient creatures you've devoured and bringing you closer to a state of undead perfection. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.Advanced Undead Benefits]. In addition, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed while you're satiated.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Paralyzing Slash] Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Feverish Enzymes</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your enzymes can paralyze your foes rather than merely making it harder for them to heal their wounds. Strike with your claw or jaws. If you hit a living non-elf creature, it becomes paralyzed unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Regardless of the result of the save, the creature is temporarily immune to Paralyzing Slash for 24 hours. A creature that becomes paralyzed can attempt a new save to end the paralysis at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Sickening Bite] Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your saliva causes severe nausea and mild fever in the living, weakening them so that you can more easily finish them off. When you critically hit a creature with your jaws, the creature is sickened 1. This is a disease effect.</p>\n<p>If you are satiated, you can end your satiation to make the target sickened 1 on a regular hit instead.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Glutton For Flesh] Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have developed a capacity to store more flesh within your gaunt body to leave yourself satiated longer. If you Consume Flesh while satiated, you become fully satiated. You stay fully satiated for 3 hours, after which you become satiated for 1 hour. If you're fully satiated when an ability would end your satiation, you cease being fully satiated but remain satiated. If you have Grave Strength, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed when fully satiated instead of a +5-foot status bonus for being satiated.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Corpse Stench] Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your body exudes an overwhelming scent of decay in a 10-foot emanation, so putrid that it nauseates creates within that range. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be sickened (plus slowed 1 on a critical failure). While within the aura, the creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to Corpse Stench for 1 minute.</p>",

                "content": "<p>One of Old-Mage Jatembe's central lessons was that magic was magic, no matter what the source. Though the Magaambya seeks to hold true to Jatembe's teachings by aiming to understand magic of all kinds, the mages of the Magaambya have found the most success with magic rooted in the material world. Halcyon speakers are powerful conversants who epitomize the Magaambyan practice of blending arcane and primal magic, seeing both traditions as flowing from the same wellspring.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Halcyon Spells</h2>\n<p>Through hard study, Magaambyans can meld arcane and primal spellcasting. Halcyon spells are spells from the arcane or primal spell list. You don't gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell levels of halcyon spells only through feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your class; for example, a wizard who gained halcyon spells would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire. If you have more than one arcane or primal spellcasting class, you add halcyon spells to all such classes.</p>\n<p>Each time you cast a halcyon spell, decide whether it is an arcane or primal spell. You can't heighten a halcyon spell beyond your maximum spell level of halcyon spell, even if you have higher-level spell slots, and you can't select a halcyon spell as a signature spell.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, and each time you gain a halcyon feat, you can swap out one of your old halcyon spells for a different halcyon spell of the same level; this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as via a sorcerer's spell repertoire class feature. You can also swap out halcyon spells by retraining during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a halcyon spell, you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Halcyon Speaker Dedication] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, member of the Magaambya of conversant rank</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You devote much of your study to halcyon magic. You gain access to two common Halcyon cantrips and two common 1st-level halcyon spells. In addition to being able to cast your halcyon spells via your arcane or primal spell slots, you also gain a 1st-level halcyon spell slot. You can use your halcyon spell slots to spontaneously cast your halcyon spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the halcyon speaker archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Dualistic Synergy] Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Halcyon Speaker Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>If your next action is to Cast a Spell from your spell slots, you gain a benefit. If the spell is arcane, you can attempt a skill check to Recall Knowledge with a +1 status bonus to the check after casting the spell, or a +2 status bonus if the spell is 7th level or higher. If the spell is primal, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the spell's level for 1 round. If the spell is a halcyon spell, you gain both benefits.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Persistent Creation] Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong> s Halcyon Speaker Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Creation]</em> as an innate spell at will, choosing whether it is arcane or primal each time. The created object lasts until you spend 1 hour not within its immediate vicinity or until it is destroyed. Such objects are called persistent creations. If you cast creation again, any persistent creation you previously created with the spell immediately disintegrates.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Halcyon Spellcasting Initiate] Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Halcyon Speaker Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your knowledge of halcyon magic increases. You gain two common 2nd-level halcyon spells and two 3rd-level halcyon spells. You also gain a 2nd-level halcyon spell slot and a 3rd-level halcyon spell slot. These and all future halcyon spell slots work like the 1st-level halcyon spell slot you gained from Halcyon Speaker Dedication.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Shared Synergy] Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Dualistic Synergy</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can grant the benefit from Dualistic Synergy to an ally within 30 feet instead of yourself, either allowing that ally to Recall Knowledge, granting that ally temporary Hit Points, or both, depending on the spell's tradition.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Charged Creation] Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Persistent Creation</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your magic is drawn to your persistent creations. While you are within 30 feet of and have line of effect to your persistent creation, you can use it as the origin point for your line or cone spells. For instance, a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Lightning Bolt]</em> could originate from the persistent creation rather than from you.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Flexible Halcyon Spellcasting] Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Halcyon Spellcasting Initiate</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You broaden your ability to channel your power into halcyon magic. You gain one more common halcyon spell of each level of halcyon spell you can cast other than your highest (you do not gain an additional cantrip). You also gain one additional halcyon spell slot for each level of halcyon spell you can cast, other than the highest.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Halcyon Spellcasting Adept] Feat 14</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Halcyon Spellcasting Initiate; master in either Arcana or Nature, expert in the other</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You refine your halcyon magic. You gain two common 4th-level halcyon spells and two 5th-level halcyon spells. You also gain a 4th-level halcyon spell slot and a 5th-level halcyon spell slot. Your proficiency rank in either arcane or primal spell DCs and spell attack rolls advances from trained to expert.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Fulminating Synergy] Feat 16</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Dualistic Synergy</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you draw upon your spells' synergy, you create a physical manifestation of their magical resonance and invoke it to harm a foe. When you use Dualistic Synergy, choose a damage type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. In addition to Dualistic Synergy's normal effect, a foe within 30 feet of you takes an amount of damage of the chosen type equal to the spell's level. If the spell already deals damage of the chosen type, combine the damage before applying weaknesses and resistances.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Halcyon Spellcasting Sage] Feat 18</h2>\n<p>Prerequisites Halcyon Spellcasting Adept; legendary in either Arcana or Nature, master in the other</p>\n<p>Your command over halcyon magic is nearly unmatched. You gain two common 6th-level and 7th-level halcyon spells. You also gain a 6th-level halcyon spell slot and a 7th-level halcyon spell slot. Your proficiency rank in either arcane or primal spell DCs and spell attack rolls advances from expert to master.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Synergistic Spell] Feat 20</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Halcyon Spellcasting Initiate, Fulminating Synergy, legendary in Arcana and Nature</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You combine your synergy and spells into a fantastic web of magic, allowing you to cast two spells at once. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell from one of your halcyon spell slots, after that spell resolves, you can Cast another Spell as a free action. This spell must be cast from one of your halcyon spell slots and be a spell that would normally take two actions to cast.</p>",

                "content": "<p>It's quite common for mages of all sorts to study necromancy-the surprisingly diverse school holds the secrets of positive and negative energy, as well as life and death. Many tap into these powers with no consideration of the morality of their use. For these unscrupulous magic users, it's simply another avenue in their never-ending pursuit of power, and the abilities learned are turned to the caster's personal ends, whatever they may be.</p>\n<p>Others choose a different path. Through spiritual study and introspection, they have come to recognize the evil intrinsic in the existence of undead, the fundamental wrongness of using the universal energy of death to create an appearance of life. To combat this evil, these casters learn to conduct positive energy and direct it to great effect against the undead they encounter. They may also engage in ongoing study to learn of the nature of life, death, and undeath, and the precise relationship between each state. These scholars and mages are commonly known as hallowed necromancers-a slightly misrepresentative name, as many of them don't use religious methods, but a frequently used shorthand regardless.</p>\n<p>The exact origin of hallowed necromancers' abilities may vary from one to the next. Some are granted their gifts directly by a sympathetic deity such as Sarenrae or Pharasma, while others might use their knowledge of religion and the planes to learn such abilities on their own. Though rarer, it's even possible these practitioners might discover they possess an intuitive understanding and control over abilities that manifest spontaneously as their capabilities grow. Despite this variance, all share a fundamental understanding that undeath is an aberration to be quickly remedied.</p>\n<p>Though the majority of hallowed necromancers have similar goals and are willing to work together, they tend not to form their own organizations. More often, these necromancers attach themselves to existing groups-such as the Knights of Lastwall or Voices of the Spire-and use their powers in support of those groups' causes. Otherwise, they plan and carry out their own personal vendettas against the forces of undeath, often enlisting the help of trusted friends and allies.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">HALLOWED NECROMANCY IN GEB\n<p>As hallowed necromancy lacks any unified credo, its practitioners are found throughout Golarion. It's rare they make their presence known within the borders of Geb, however. Those who hide their profession usually move on to other lands and those who openly crusade against Geb's many undead quickly find themselves utterly overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>Hallowed necromancers captured in Geb might be executed only to be risen by their foes with their spellcasting ability intact but moral code absent or twisted.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Hallowed Necromancer Dedication] Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> good alignment, able to cast spells using spell slots, able to cast at least one necromancy spell, expert in Religion</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've studied techniques allowing you to blend so-called hallowed necromancy into your own spellcasting to bolster the living and destroy the undead. You gain the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Hallowed Ground]</em> focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Refocus] activity. You can Refocus by meditating or praying to connect yourself to conduits of positive energy. Focus spells from the hallowed necromancer archetype have the same tradition as your spell slots. Casting spells that create, heal, or otherwise aid or promote undead is anathema to you, as is cooperation with undead. Using negative energy isn't anathema, as it serves a natural purpose, but twisting that negative energy for creation is blasphemous to you. If you perform acts that are anathema to your principles, you lose access to all feats from this archetype.

You can either prepare these spells or add them to your repertoire just like the spells normally on your tradition's spell list.

In addition, your knowledge of the conduits to the Positive Energy Plane allows you more flexibility with these spells. Choose one of these two benefits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you're a prepared spellcaster, you can spend 10 minutes to replace one of the spells you've prepared with a spell of the same level from the list of sacred spells. You can do this while Refocusing.</li>\n<li>If you're a spontaneous spellcaster with the signature spells class feature, add two of the spells from the list of sacred spells to your repertoire.

You devised a unique and incredibly evil ritual to tear your soul from your body, and you painstakingly crafted a receptacle to house your freed soul.

You gain a unique soul cage—a magic item that houses your soul. Whenever you would die, your soul flees to the soul cage to allow you to be rebuilt. As long as your soul cage exists, you can't truly be destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the lich archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Drain Soul Cage] Feat 14</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Lich Dedication, Drain Bonded Item, spellbook</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You make your soul cage into your bonded item, allowing you to harness its abundant magical energy.

You disguise the soul cage as any non-magical object of the same Bulk, and it gains the effects of the magic aura and nondetection spells.

The damage die for your fist increases to 1d6 instead of 1d4, it deals negative damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and it loses the nonlethal trait. Your fist becomes magical. When you critically hit a living creature with your fist Strike, the creature is slowed 1 until the end of your next turn unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your spell DC.

If another creature attempts to Decipher Writing you encoded, they take a -2 circumstance penalty unless they speak all the languages you used when you created the writing.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Phonetic Training] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Linguist Dedication, expert in Society</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can pronounce and repeat words with near-perfect accuracy even if you don't understand their meaning, and you can write them down in a phonetic script that allows you or another creature with Phonetic Training to read it later. Even if the words are in a language with sound you can't pronounce, you can faithfully transcribe them. Memorizing long sequences of words remains just as difficult as it is normally.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spot Translate] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Linguist Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Another creature within 60 feet uses a linguistic effect in a language you understand.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You interpret a creature's words, repeating their message in a different language that you know. If the triggering effect's targets speak either the original language or the one you translated into, they are affected.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Analyze Idiolect] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Linguist Dedication, expert in Deception and Society</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You break down a specific individual's idiolect, memorizing their speech mannerisms and habits. If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, when you later attempt to Impersonate that individual, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Deception checks and DCs. Due to the intense character study required, you can't remember more than one idiolect at a time.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Read Shibboleths] Feat 7</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Linguist Dedication, master in Society</p>\n<hr />\n<p>All communication is filled with slight tells and signals. If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, their regional words, pronunciation changes, and nonverbal cues provide you with a minor fact about their social environment, such as their hometown or certain groups they might belong to. If a target of this ability is being deceptive about their social environment, such as a commoner pretending to be a noble, they must attempt a Deception, Society, or appropriate Lore check against your Society DC, providing you a false minor fact consistent with their assumed identity on a success.</p>\n<p>Once you've gleaned one or more true minor facts about a person, you can then incorporate these mannerisms into your speech to present yourself in a way that they find familiar. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to your Diplomacy and Deception checks with them.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Crude Communication] Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Linguist Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Even if you don't speak a creature's language, you can rely on inflection, root words, and body language to infer rudimentary meaning. If you interact with a creature for at least 10 minutes and that creature can speak a language, the GM rolls a secret Society check with a DC appropriate for the language's rarity. On a success, you understand the gist of the meaning and can communicate basic concepts back to the creature; on a failure, you are mistaken or communicate incorrect concepts. If you're legendary in Society, you can communicate instantly without needing to attempt a Society check; even if you didn't know the medium of communication the creature uses (speech, sign language, and so on), you intuit this information as soon as they try to communicate.</p>",

It is easily recognized as more than a simple mask unless the familiar succeeds at a Deception check to Impersonate a mask. Other than its appearance and the fact that it can be worn, it functions as other familiars.

You don't need to eat or drink and need only 6 hours of rest to feel well rested. You must still rest at least 8 hours and spend 1 hour of preparation to regain resources usable only a limited number of times per day, such as spell slots.</p><p>You can draw on primal power to stay awake and alert while otherwise resting your body and mind, gaining the full benefits of an 8-hour rest without falling asleep.

Select any number of targets of the spell and reduce the spell's damage to those targets by an amount equal to the spell's level. Until your next turn, when one of those targets damages you, that damage is reduced by twice the spell's level.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Uzunjati Storytelling] Feat 6</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, Uzunjati affiliation, master in a Recall Knowledge skill</p><hr /><p>You tell a quick story or begin telling a longer tale. This is most useful when you want to prove your scholarly credibility or impress someone quickly. Roll a check with a skill that can be used to Recall Knowledge in which you have expert proficiency, using the result entry for the Perform action. Like Performing, Storytelling rarely has an effect on its own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent Diplomacy checks against the observers-or even change their attitudes-if the GM sees fit. This action is not a Performance and cannot be used in place of anything that requires you to Perform.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Cascade Bearer's Spellcasting] Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, Cascade Bearers affiliation</p><hr /><p>Your Cascade Bearer training allows you to broaden the horizons of your halcyon spells further than most Magaambyans, weaving in spiritual magic. You can select halcyon spells from the divine or occult spell lists in additional to the arcane or primal spell lists, though they are still halcyon spells (so you choose when casting if they are arcane or primal spells). You gain a halcyon cantrip and a halcyon 1st-level spell.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Emerald Boughs Hideaway] Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, Emerald Boughs affiliation</p><hr /><p>You use Emerald Bough techniques to create a small extradimensional space called a hideaway that lasts as long as you are conscious. The hideaway functions as a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Bag of Holding (Type I)], but has no Bulk and takes no hands; it holds one object with a maximum Bulk equal to your highest mental ability score modifier; as you open the hideaway with pure thought, activating it to retrieve an item is a free action with the envision component instead of a single action with the Interact component. The hideaway's access point appears as an obviously magical gap within 1 foot of your body. Only you can access the hideaway; you can you use an Interact action each round to physically hold it open for another person. A successful dispel magic spell or similar effect against your spell DC and the hideaway's counteract level of 2 expels the object; the object is also expelled if you become unconscious.

A keen and incisive perception is necessary, of course, but that alone won't be sufficient. While many a ranger or rogue must sharpen their senses or face a short career, a true overwatch must be able to apply information received from all five senses (and any additional special senses they might have) to make split-second decisions that work toward achieving a tactical goal. Such a response can partially be trained through hours of daily drills designed to help a potential overwatch separate true threats and situations requiring their skills from false positives, and even situations where they would cause a problem if they didn't hold back. However, while training helps ingrain good practice into one's reflexes and muscle memory, ultimately, an overwatch candidate who lacks an innate degree of good tactical instinct will find such training slow to produce results, or in the worst case, even impossible.</p>\n<p>Beyond senses and instinct, the role of overwatch requires the ability to innovate your enhanced visual gear to assist in removing blind spots and seeing what others miss. This is essential, since you must keep track of your team and nearby foes. While it isn't explicitly necessary for you to be the one with enough skill in Crafting to maintain and upgrade your enhanced visual gear, many successful overwatches choose to do so in order to better understand how every piece works together to create the whole.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Overwatch Dedication] Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Perception</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have an innate knack for tactical observation, and you've innovated to apply that knack in a variety of ways that allow you to assist your allies.

Over time, this pact slowly changes the initiate internally and, sometimes, externally as well. The initiate's mind slowly fills with ancient pieces of lore and techniques that are as much part of the saumen kar as their hands and feet. As the initiate's mind adapts to this knowledge and power, their body sometimes evolves in kind—sprouting sweeping horns, gaining heightened olfactory senses, and growing additional height and muscle—becoming a hybrid between their old ancestry and saumen kar, wrapped in runic tattoos.</p><p>An unwilling creature can never be forced to become a pactbound initiate, and only those with deep bonds of mutual friendship with a saumen kar can even attempt the process. Befriending a saumen kar can be enough to begin one's initiation into the pact, though they must choose to accept the burden and can change their minds about undertaking the pact at any point until their final transition (represented by the Bound in Ice feat). Once a creature has completed the pact by accepting the full burden of a saumen kar and taking the Bound in Ice feat, all transformations are permanent. At that point, they can't retrain the Pactbound Dedication, Frostbite Runes, or Bound in Ice feats and must live out the rest of their lives as something between their old ancestry and a saumen kar. If their normal lifespan was less than 400 years, it's increased to at least 400 years. If their natural lifespan was greater than 400 years, it's instead reduced to approximately that amount of time.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pactbound Dedication] Feat 2</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Erutaki or Jotun language, trained in Nature, must have earned the trust of a saumen kar who initiates you into the archetype</p><hr /><p>You befriended one of the last saumen kar and were infused with a fraction of their power, granting you the potential to become a guardian of their ancient pact.

You can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Hide] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sneak] while it's snowing even lightly, even if it wouldn't be thick enough to normally grant concealment. Finally, all saumen kar can sense the mark of their pact upon you, and their attitude toward you is typically one step better than it would be otherwise (hostile to unfriendly, unfriendly to indifferent, etc.) Most saumen kar are unfriendly to outsiders; this would make them indifferent to you.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the pactbound initiate archetype.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ice Crafter] Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pactbound Dedication]</p><hr /><p>The ancient ice-crafting techniques of the saumen kar awaken within you.

You can craft permanent items out of ice instead of metal or wood; these items are a translucent crystal-blue in color, resemble icicles and glacier ice, and have the same statistics and properties as cold iron, including the price and the ability to deal additional damage to certain kinds of creatures. Any creature who wields or wears a piece of ice-crafted equipment takes 1 cold damage each round from contact with the primal cold of the crafted ice.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Crown of the Saumen Kar] Feat 6</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pactbound Dedication]</p><hr /><p>Your body begins to evolve and adapt, taking the first steps towards blending your very self with the ancient curse of the saumen kar.

You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against evil and necromancy spells and effects. You can sense the presence of evil undead as a pervasive taste of oily corruption in the air; this is a vague sense that allows you to know when such a creature is within 60 feet of you, though you can't precisely pinpoint their location with this sense. As normal for a vague sense, it can be fooled, but undead might not realize they need to take precautions against it. This sense also extends to living creatures who have the negative healing ability, like dhampir.</p><p>You deal an additional 1 cold damage with all Strikes made with an ice-crafted weapon.

The prison is a sphere made of unmelting ice, just large enough to fit your target. The target, and any creatures sharing its space, must attempt a Reflex save, with a DC using the higher of your class DC and spell DC. A creature that fails becomes trapped inside the prison. If it succeeds, the creature is pushed outside the prison into a space of its choice. If the target shares its space with a gargantuan creature, the effect fails.</p><p>The dome has AC 10, Hardness 20, and 40 Hit Points; it's immune to cold, critical hits, and precision damage.

Choose one cantrip from the arcane, divine, occult, or primal list. You can activate your wayfinder to cast that cantrip at will.

You can spend 1 minute to assemble a facsimile of an object of no more than 1 Bulk that you can see from available materials. The facsimile has the same shape and Bulk as the replaced object and can pass as the object if not examined. A creature familiar with the original who examines the object automatically realizes that it is a fake. A creature not familiar with the original can still tell it was a hastily jury-rigged stand-in of some kind, but they might not know the object was supposed to be something else.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Discerning Strike] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication, Thorough Reports</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have successfully identified the target with Recall Knowledge during this combat.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Identifying a creature is the first step in finding its weaknesses. Attempt a Strike against the target; if successful, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage. If you have succeeded on a Recall Knowledge check against the target during this combat and their creature type was previously recorded using Thorough Reports, you also deal [[/r 1[bleed]]] damage. The creature is then temporarily immune to Discerning Strike for 1 day.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Forced Entry] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Athletics, Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You are trained to preserve the archaeological value of your location when entering.

When making your daily preparations, you can choose one 1st-level spell from your spellbook or spell repertoire and store it in your wayfinder. You can cast this spell from the wayfinder using the normal actions required. Once the spell has been cast, it is expended, and you must make your next daily preparations to store another spell in your wayfinder.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Diverse Recognition] Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication, master in a skill used to Recall Knowledge</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You successfully Recall Knowledge about a creature you can see, using a skill in which you are a master.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your Pathfinder training allows you to quickly size up numerous threats.

You must still meet the requirements to attempt this check.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Recognize Threat] Feat 8</h2>\n<div><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in a Recall Knowledge skill, Pathfinder Agent Dedication\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have master proficiency in a skill to identify the triggering creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your first turn of an encounter begins, and you can see a creature.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p>You quickly assess the threat so you can relay the information to your team. Attempt a Recall Knowledge check against the triggering creature.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Snap Out Of It! (Pathfinder Agent)]{Snap Out Of It!} Feat 8</h2>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication, master in Medicine</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Pathfinders are trained to help each other be safe and successful, and you know how to jolt your allies back to their senses. Attempt a Medicine check on an adjacent ally who is fascinated, frightened, stunned, or stupefied and choose one of those conditions. The DC is the DC for the effect that caused the condition.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 2. If you chose fascinated, that condition ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose fascinated, that condition ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You increase the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose fascinated, increase the duration by 1 round instead.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Wayfinder Resonance Infiltrator] Feat 8</h2>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication, Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You are adept at using the unusual resonance of your wayfinder to aid in any deceptions you might employ. Once per day you can activate your wayfinder to cast illusory disguise, heightened to 2nd level, as an arcane spell. Additionally, once per day, you can Activate your wayfinder with a single-action envision activation to transform it into a perfect replica of another similarly sized badge of membership or office, such as an Aspis Consortium badge. This transformation lasts for 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Eidetic Memorization] Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Pathfinders are often asked to study the intricacies of ancient history under less than ideal conditions, and you've trained your brain to make the most of your limited time. You quickly memorize an inscription, scroll, or other piece of writing you can clearly see whose length is equivalent to no more than one page. You can then accurately recreate this writing using a writing kit, wax tablet, or other writing medium, once you have reached safety. You don't need to understand the writing or identify the language to reproduce it. Your memory lasts until the next time you make your daily preparations; if you have not written down or otherwise recreated what you saw by this point, your memory fades and any attempt to recreate what you saw is garbled and unintelligible. You can have only one piece of writing memorized at a time; any previous memorization fades the next time you use this ability.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Everyone Duck!] Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You fail, but don't critically fail, an attempt to Disable a Device on a trap.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You intentionally set off the trap, but you take special precautions to protect yourself and your allies from the trap's effects. For the next 2 rounds, if the trap rolls a critical success on an attack roll, it gets a normal success instead, and if anyone rolls a critical failure on their saving throw against the trap, they get a normal failure instead.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Educated Assessment] Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You attempt to Recall Knowledge about a creature, and the GM uses the same secret roll result against the creature's Deception or Stealth DC, giving you the information from a Battle Assessment. You might get a different degree of success on the Recall Knowledge check than what you get for the Battle Assessment.

You're both the director and the star of this show, and your enemies dance to the tune you play with your pistol... sometimes quite literally!</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>What Makes a Phenom?</h4>\n<p>Many gunslingers can learn how to twirl a pistol or intimidate a foe, but it's not just your skills that make you a phenom, it's your style and attitude. As a pistol phenom, you understand how to grab everyone's attention with everything you do, especially the way you talk, the way you walk, and the way you use your gun. But what's more, you're well aware of that fact and the power you have over others, and you aren't afraid to flaunt it.</p>\n<p>Despite this attitude, or perhaps because of it, as a pistol phenom you likely tend to get along well with groups of allies, understanding both how to take the spotlight to protect your allies and how to share it to make sure they get their time in the sun. The one exception to this can be other pistol phenoms. When two or more pistol phenoms gather in the same group, it's almost inevitable for a duel or other contest to arise. However, such a contest need not end in enmity. Depending on your temperament, and that of the other pistol phenom, the result of the exhilarating rivalry expressed during competition could be a lifelong friendship, albeit one in which you both keep score of your greatest achievements to compare exploits.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pistol Phenom Dedication] Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in at least one type of one-handed firearm, trained in Deception, trained in Performance</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You catch an opponent off-guard by spinning your weapon. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pistol Twirl] gunslinger feat, enabling you to Feint against creatures within your weapon's first range increment. This otherwise serves as Pistol Twirl for the purpose of meeting prerequisites, although as normal, it doesn't count as another pistol phenom feat for the purpose of meeting Pistol Phenom Dedication's special entry and taking another archetype. Whenever you Feint with a one-handed firearm, you can choose to attempt a Performance check instead of a Deception check.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained at least two other feats from the pistol phenom archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Gunpowder Gauntlet] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pistol Phenom Dedication]</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're wielding a loaded one-handed firearm.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your flair keeps foes' attention, as your motions with your gun draw your foes into a deadly game. As you toy with them and performatively brandish your weapon, you build their tunnel vision, leaving them trapped in a perceptual gauntlet of your own making. Attempt a Performance check against the Will DC of a single target within your one-handed firearm's first range increment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target takes a -2 status penalty to attack rolls against creatures other than you until the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target takes a -1 status penalty to attack rolls against creatures other than you until the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Dazzling Bullet] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pistol Phenom Dedication]</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your tricks discombobulate your opponent, leaving spots in their vision from the bright flash of your gunshot reflected straight into their eyes (or other visual organs). Attempt a Performance check against the target creature's Will DC and make a ranged firearm Strike against that target. If the Strike deals damage to the target creature and you succeed at the Performance check, the creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] for 1 round.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Hot Foot] Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pistol Phenom Dedication]</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're wielding a loaded firearm.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Using a carefully aimed shot, you make a creature \"dance.\" You shoot at the ground near a target's feet, causing them to react involuntarily; even mindless creatures have unconscious responses to dodge an attack, and you can capitalize off those uncontrollable reflexes to achieve your aim. As they dance to the sweet tune of your pistol's retort, you ensure your foe can't use whatever nasty surprise they had planned in store for you and your allies. Make an attack roll against the Reflex DC of a target creature within your firearm's first range increment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature can't use reactions, is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Flat-Footed], and takes a -2 circumstance penalty to Reflex saves. These effects last until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature can't use reactions until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Phenom's Verve] Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pistol Phenom Dedication]</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You're possessed with an incredibly vivacious spark that separates you not only from ordinary gun users and gunslingers, but even from other phenoms. Using that distinctive verve, when you perform impeccably and control the scene with your abilities, you also manage to set up your foes for disaster and ensure they remain in your sights for any follow-up attacks you want to make against them. If you critically succeed at a Performance check for Pistol Twirl or a pistol phenom archetype feat, you gain a +1 status bonus to your attack rolls with one-handed firearms and one-handed melee weapons until the end of your turn.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Reach for the Sky] Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pistol Phenom Dedication]</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're wielding a loaded firearm.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You command the room, firing a gun into the air and ordering everyone to surrender and put their hands in the air. You fire your firearm and then attempt a single Intimidation check to Demoralize each enemy within 30 feet. Creatures who become frightened instinctively put their hands in the air. If they had Raised a Shield, they lose the benefits, as they raise the shield above their head where it's of little use to block attacks. With their hands in the air, each of these frightened creatures can't use reactions or free actions that require their hands, or items held in their hands, until the beginning of their next turn. Regardless of the result, each creature is then temporarily immune to Reach for the Sky for 1 minute.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Whirling Knockdown] Feat 14</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pistol Phenom Dedication]</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're wielding a loaded one-handed firearm and a one-handed melee weapon.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You fire your gun while throwing off a target's balance with your melee weapon. Then, you topple your foe to the ground with the quick orchestrated combination. You don't need to use brute force to do so, or even necessarily to hit with your gunshot; the effect is all about performing perfectly and eliminating your target's movements and options, leaving them no choice but to fall.</p>\n<p>Make a ranged firearm Strike against a creature within the reach of your melee weapon and then attempt a Performance check against the creature's Reflex DC. If the Strike critically succeeds, the target takes a -2 circumstance penalty to its Reflex DC against this check. The Performance check has the following effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target falls and lands @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone]. It takes [[/r 2d6[bludgeoning]]] damage from the fall.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target falls and lands prone.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your plans backfired on you, and you're forced to drop your melee weapon in your space.</p>",

You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to remember a detail that has come up before in the current adventure, even if it was more than 24 hours ago.</p><p>If you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Thorough Reports] feat and have expert proficiency in the skill you're using to Recall Knowledge, your circumstance bonus to Recall Knowledge about creatures from that feat increases to +4.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Scrollmaster archetype.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Foolproof Instructions] Feat 8</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Scrollmaster Dedication</p><hr /><p>You feel confident that you can explain your scrolls so well that even your allies can use them... hopefully. During your daily preparations, you can select a single scroll and instruct a single ally in its use. Until your next daily preparations, the ally can attempt to use the scroll with a single action that has the manipulate trait. The ally rolls the skill corresponding to the spellcasting tradition. The GM determines the DC based on the scroll's level, possibly adjusted for the situation. If the spell has a spell attack bonus or a spell DC, use your level as the proficiency bonus and the highest of your ally's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifiers.</p><hr /><p><strong>Success</strong> For the rest of the ally's turn, they can spend actions to Cast the Spell.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> The ally misremembers your instructions and can't use the scroll this turn.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The ally misunderstood your instructions and can't use the scroll.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Innate Magical Intuition] Feat 8</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Scrollmaster Dedication</p><hr /><p>You've spent countless hours learning to recognize and predict a creature's innate magical abilities. The first time you successfully Recall Knowledge to identify a creature, in addition to any information you learn from your successful check, you learn the names of three of the highest-level innate spells it can cast, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your next save against an innate spell cast by that creature.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Lore Seeker] Feat 8</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Scrollmaster Dedication</p><hr /><p>You see what others don't, and you've developed magical tricks to find hidden truth.

If you could already cast spells, these spells are of the same tradition. Otherwise, they are arcane spells, you use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability, and you become trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for arcane spells.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Magic Finder] Feat 8</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Scrollmaster Dedication</p><hr /><p>You've learned a few tricks to ensure you find every last magic item and interesting magical effect during your missions. You can cast detect magic and read aura as innate spells at will. You can also cast locate as an innate spell once per day, but only to locate magic items, not specific mundane objects or types of objects. If you could already cast spells, these spells are of the same tradition. Otherwise, they're arcane spells, you use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability, and you become trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for arcane spells.</p><p>When you cast detect magic or read aura from this feat on an item or creature under the effect of a magic aura spell or interact with an item under the effect of an item facade spell, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your check to disbelieve the illusion.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Transcribe Moment] Feat 8</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Scrollmaster Dedication</p><hr /><p>You gain the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Transcribe Moment]</em> focus spell.

When you Decipher Writing, you need only half as long as usual (reducing the time from about 1 minute to about half a minute per page), and if you fail, you don't take the usual -2 circumstance penalty to further checks to decipher that text.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Bestiary Scholar] Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in Arcana, Crafting, Nature, Occultism, or Religion; Scrollmaster Dedication</p><hr /><p>You learn how to apply your extensive knowledge of certain creatures using the lore you know. When you gain this feat, choose one of the following skills in which you have attained master proficiency: Arcana, Crafting, Nature, Occultism, or Religion.

In addition, when you critically succeed at identifying a creature, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll or saving throw against that creature.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Cautious Delver] Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Scrollmaster Dedication</p><hr /><p>You've studied the many ways that ancient architects and spellcasters protected their possessions, such as by implementing deadly traps and curses, and learned some magic to counteract them. You can cast dispel magic, knock, and resist energy as innate spells, each once per day. If you can already cast spells, these spells are of the same tradition.</p><p>Otherwise, they're arcane spells, you use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability, and you become trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for arcane spells.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Font of Knowledge] Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Scrollmaster Dedication</p><hr /><p>Experience or focused study have granted you mastery of a number of topics. When you know about something, you know about it in great detail. When you succeed at a check to Recall Knowledge, you gain additional information or context. When you critically succeed at a check to Recall Knowledge, at the GM's discretion, you might gain even more additional information or context than normal.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Masterful Obfuscation] Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in a skill with the Recall Knowledge action, Scrollmaster Dedication</p><hr /><p>You've mastered the art of deceiving others about your area of study. When you gain this feat, choose one skill with the Recall Knowledge action in which you have attained master proficiency. You can attempt to deceive others about the truth of facts and knowledge related to that skill-such as by pretending to know something that you don't, planting false information, or the like-using the Lie action of the Deception skill. When you Lie in this way, attempt your skill check using the skill you selected when you gained this feat instead of Deception, applying all bonuses or penalties related from the selected skill to the check. While it's easier to convince someone who knows nothing about your chosen false information, on a critical success, you can even convince someone who has heard something contradictory, unless they have reason to be certain from direct experience. For instance, you might say, \"I know you may have heard to use silver weapons against vampires, but that's a misconception based on conflating them with werewolves. According to all credible scholars, cold iron will do the trick.\" Once a creature realizes you've used masterful obfuscation to Lie to them, either from a failed check or due to later discovering the falsehood, you can't use this feat against them again, as it relies on blind trust in your superior knowledge. However, you can still Lie to them normally.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Determined Lore Seeker] Feat 12</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> <span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Lore Seeker]</span></p><hr /><p>You've mastered useful spells that let you find hidden truths others might miss, and a preferred spell comes naturally to you. When you gain this feat, choose one of the innate spells granted by the Lore Seeker feat: comprehend language, restore senses, or see invisibility. You can cast this spell three times per day instead of once per day. When you cast any of the spells granted by Lore Seeker as innate spells, they gain additional effects. When you cast comprehend language, the spell is heightened to 4th level. When you cast restore senses,the spell is heightened to half your level, rounded up. When you cast see invisibility, for the duration of the spell you can use an action, which has the concentrate trait, to see invisible creatures normally (instead of seeing them as translucent shapes that are concealed to you) until the end of your next turn.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ward Mind] Feat 16</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Scrollmaster Dedication</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're currently affected by a mental effect that you gained by failing, but not critically failing, a saving throw.</p><p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your turn ends.</p><hr /><p>To protect the knowledge within your mind from intrusion or erasure, you ward yourself against a mental attack, temporarily delaying its effects. Until the end of your next turn, you ignore a single mental effect that meets the requirement. You can suppress a particular effect using Ward Mind or Cognitive Loophole only once, even if you have both feats.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> You can use this reaction even if the mental effect prevents you from using reactions.</p>",

Moving amid the inky blackness, shadowdancers are spies, assassins, infiltrators, and emissaries. Some shadowdancers use their relationship with the dark for good, while others embrace the primordial night, its terror, and its betrayal.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the reason why someone embraces the shadows, the shadows embrace that person in turn, gradually transforming them into something inky, nebulous, and mysterious.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats</strong> 10th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Uncanny Dodge]; 14th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spring from the Shadows]; 16th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Sense The Unseen]; 18th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Cognitive Loophole]</p>\n<p><strong>CALL OF SHADOWS</strong></p>\n<p>The shadows call out to a potential shadowdancer in a myriad of ways.

Many potential shadowdancers hear the shadows whisper in their heads. First dismissed as some perverse trick of the mind, the whispers can seem to ebb and wane, but a true calling becomes more lucid and more compelling.</p>\n<p>In some shadow-infused lands in the Pathfinder setting, particularly Nidal, Ustalav, and even Cheliax, organizations search for and recruit those called by the shadows, eager to transform them into spies and assassins. But the call can come to any creature anywhere. It's just a question of whether the creature heeds the call and forms a pact with the shadows.</p>\n<p>Though it is hard to convince many folks otherwise, given the fearsome reputations of shadowdancers working for dark powers and cabals, there is nothing intrinsically evil about embracing the shadows.

Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Wisdom.</p>\n<p>When you have at least two other feats from this archetype, the spiral glows with bright light in a 10-foot radius (and dim light for the next 10 feet). Feats that require a creature or object to be in the light of your spiral function whether it's in the bright or dim light.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the soul warden archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Cycle Spell] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Soul Warden Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your devotion to the cycle of souls grants you an additional divine spell. Choose from <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Bless]</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Disrupting Weapons]</em>, or <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Heal]</em>. You must make this selection when you take this feat and it can't be changed. Once per day, while your spiral is glowing, you can cast the selected spell as a divine innate spell.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Psychopomp Familiar] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Soul Warden Dedication, familiar</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your familiar becomes a masked psychopomp-an extraplanar guardian of the cycle of souls. This familiar continues to use all the same rules as other familiars, but one of its abilities must always be speech and it has the monitor and psychopomp traits. As normal when a familiar must always have a certain ability, the speech ability counts against your familiar's abilities each day.</p>\n<p>You can select three familiar or master abilities each day, instead of two, but one must be one of the following psychopomp familiar abilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Soul Sight</strong> Your familiar gains lifesense with a range of 30 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Spirit Touch</strong> Your familiar can touch incorporeal creatures. If you have the spell delivery master ability from your familiar, any spell the familiar delivers with it gains the benefits of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Ghost Touch] property rune.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Liberate Soul] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Soul Warden Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The light flows from your sigil of Pharasma to shatter the bonds imprisoning a soul. You attempt to counteract a possession effect, or an effect, object, or spell that is imprisoning a soul (such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Bind Soul]</em>, a soul gem, or a devourer's devoured souls). You must be within 60 feet of the possessed creature or object, or of the receptacle imprisoning the soul. Your counteract level is half your level rounded up, and your counteract modifier is your divine spell DC - 10. If the attempt fails, you can't use Liberate Soul against that particular effect again unless circumstances have changed drastically, as determined by the GM.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spiral Sworn] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Soul Warden Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You trace a spiral in the air while intoning prayers to Pharasma, gaining her blessing for a time. For 3 rounds, your Strikes and spells deal additional damage against undead, creatures in possession of an imprisoned soul, or creatures you have witnessed create or command undead. You gain a status bonus to damage with your Strikes against these creatures equal to the number of weapon damage dice. Spells you cast from spell slots gain a status bonus to damage against these creatures equal to the level of the spell; this bonus applies only to spells that deal damage and don't have a duration.</p>\n<p>If your spiral is glowing, you can target a willing creature in its light. If you do, that creature gains the bonuses instead of you.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Enhanced Psychopomp Familiar] Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Psychopomp Familiar</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your psychopomp's continued service in Pharasma's name brings it favor from the goddess. It might change appearance to look like a different, more powerful kind of psychopomp. You can select four familiar or master abilities each day, instead of two, but two must be from the Psychopomp Familiar feat or the following ability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Augury</strong> Your familiar can glimpse the strands of fate to give you a cryptic clue regarding your future. Your familiar can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Augury]</em> once per day using your magical tradition and spell DC. You must be at least 8th level to select this ability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Safeguard Soul] Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Soul Warden Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've girded your soul against outside interference. You gain a +2 status bonus to saving throws against death effects, possession effects, and effects that attempt to manipulate or steal your soul. You can't be transformed into an undead by any means. While your spiral is glowing, your allies in the light of the spiral gain this benefit as well.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Expand Spiral] Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Spiral Sworn</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your prayers encompass your companions, granting you the ability to share Pharasma's blessings. When you use Spiral Sworn, you can spend 2 actions instead of 1 to grant the benefits to all allies who are in the light of your spiral when you take the action.</p>",

You manifest an armor, shield, or weapon as a soulforged armament. Choose one essence power for the armament.

The weapon gains the thrown 30 feet trait and has the returning rune (even if it already has its maximum number of property runes). <em>Corruption Flaw</em> When you make a Strike with a thrown or ranged weapon and miss, reroll the Strike, targeting your ally nearest to the target. This Strike uses the same multiple attack penalty as the missed Strike and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Deep-Seeded Fear</strong> You gain a +2 status bonus to your Intimidation checks and don't take any penalties for not sharing a language when Demoralizing foes who can perceive your armament's essence form. When you manifest the essence form, you can attempt to Demoralize an enemy who can perceive the manifestation. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> If you attempt to Demoralize an enemy, your Demoralize also targets the ally closest to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Determined Toughness</strong> Any status penalties you take from the following conditions are 1 less than their condition's value: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]. This doesn't change the actual condition value, or any other effects of the condition (such as stupefied's disruption and its DC). <em>Corruption Flaw</em> Whenever you take a status penalty from the listed conditions, you also take a -1 penalty to the same statistics.</p>\n<p><strong>Harmful Malice</strong> (necromancy, negative) Your Strikes deal an additional 1d4 negative damage. Once while the armament is manifested, you can cast harm as an innate spell, with a level equal to half your level rounded up. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> Reduce any damage you would deal by half your level.</p>\n<p><strong>Heroic Heart</strong> (enchantment, mental) You gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, Perception checks, skill checks, and saves. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> You take a -1 penalty to attack rolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Healing Grace</strong> (healing, necromancy, positive) You gain fast healing equal to half your level. You can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Heal]</em> once as an innate spell with a level equal to half your level rounded up. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> Reduce all healing you would receive or grant with a spell by half your level.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical Resilience</strong> (abjuration) Armor or shield only.

When you manifest the essence form, choose one damage type: acid, chaotic, cold, electricity, evil, fire, good, lawful, negative, positive, or sonic. You gain resistance equal to your level + 2 to damage of the selected type. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> You gain weakness 1 to all damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Planar Pain</strong> (evocation) Weapon only. When you manifest the essence form, choose one damage type: acid, chaotic, cold, electricity, evil, fire, good, lawful, negative, positive, or sonic. Attacks with the weapon deal this type of damage instead of their physical damage with a +2 status bonus to the damage. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> When you deal damage with a weapon or unarmed attack, you take 2 damage of the last type you chose for planar pain, even if the damage type normally wouldn't harm you, such as good damage if you aren't evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Pull of Stasis</strong> (transmutation) Weapon only. Any time you hit with the soulforged weapon, the target takes a -10-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. On a critical hit, the creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] for 1 round instead. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> You take a -10-foot penalty to all your Speeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflecting Spirit</strong> Armor or shield only.

If an enemy's physical ranged attack misses you, you can use your reaction to immediately attempt a ranged Strike against the attacker using the projectile that missed. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> You have weakness 5 to physical ranged attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Resolute Defiance</strong> Shield only.

You gain a +1 status bonus to your attack roll if making an attack or to your AC if you were hit. This can change the outcome of the roll. If this bonus turns your missed attack into a hit or the hit against you into a miss, attempt a DC 5 flat check. If you fail, your soulforged armament is Dismissed-your weapon if you attacked or your armor or shield if you were defending.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Rapid Manifestation] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Soulforger Dedication]</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You roll initiative or a hazard attacks you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your unwavering soul brings up your defenses as soon as you're in danger.

Each armament can manifest its essence form only once per day.</p>\n<p>When you gain soulforged corruption, choose one armament's corruption flaw to affect you for stage 1. At stage 2, you take the flaws of all your soulforged armaments. While you have the curse, each armament gets a separate flat check to manifest its essence form, and failing prevents you from manifesting only that armament's essence form.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat a second time at 12th level or higher, choosing the final item type.</p>",

                "content": "<p>Just as Golarion's merchants scour busy marketplaces for newfound goods, scholars of magic congregate in teahouses, debate at symposia, and haunt the back rooms of esoteric shops to swap secrets of their trade. In such meetings, a different kind of magic may strike: the spark of innovation! The mixing of magical techniques produces fascinating and unpredictable results. As one of these innovators, sometimes called a spell trickster, you have a knack for pioneering magical techniques and discovering new effects from spells most novice spellcasters take for granted. Whether your unique abilities are the result of weeks of experimentation or a secret passed to you by a traveling practitioner, you delight in surprising others with your tricks.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>The Fruits of Research</h4>\n<p>While magic can spring from many sources, from wizard tutors to self-taught savants, the art of the spell trickster often springs from sophisticated magical research. The magical academies in Golarion have no claim to magic as a whole but can often teach lesser-known variants of a spell to their students. At the Magaambya academy in the Mwangi Expanse, for instance, initiates study multiple traditions of magic, adapting the techniques of harnessing magical essence from one tradition to create new methods of casting spells in another. The Arclords of Nex have spent thousands of years honing spells in both wartime and peace, demonstrating a fine control over the arcane by effortlessly changing their magic to suit their whims. The return of New Thassilon brought thousands of magical dabblers and scholars, each with their own unique tricks and each eager to see what new spell variants have developed in their long absence.</p>\n<p>This isn't to say that spell tricksters come solely from high academia. A sorcerer might demonstrate aberrant powers in her bloodline magic, hinting at a background more complex than a single eldritch influence acting upon her. An oracle might grope at a divine power that they poorly understand and cast a spell in a unique manner simply because they were never taught otherwise. A witch's patron or a whimsical deity might grant a favored servant a special power for whatever strange motives such beings might possess. Magic in Golarion isn't entirely predictable, no matter how many practitioners wish that it was so. While most spellcasters follow predictable patterns in their art, there are always exceptions.</p>\n<p>The rules in this section are presented as part of an archetype, meant for a character dedicated to the art of innovating magic—but you don't have to limit yourself to this premise. At the GM's discretion, a spell trickster feat could be made available to a character as a class feat without the character taking the archetype. In most cases, this option should only be offered as a reward or story element that the character, GM, or group has dedicated a significant amount of time to developing—a character who wishes to partake in these options without GM permission or involvement should simply take the spell trickster archetype. These feats could be used to represent the payoff from extended magical research; finding forgotten or forbidden lore in a lost corner of Golarion; pleasing a god, patron, or other notable power; a magical plane or artifact exerting its influence; or any other number of situations that an adventurer might encounter while exploring. Keep in mind, however, that these feats were created and balanced to be part of an archetype. If allowing spell trickster feats as general class feats begins to negatively impact the game, the players should be willing to walk the decision back and rebuild characters as necessary.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spell Trickster Dedication] Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Able to cast spells; trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your experience with magic and its traditions lets you specialize in the casting of certain spells, customizing familiar spells to create novel effects. Whenever you gain a feat from this archetype, you either learn to modify the effects of a single spell, or you change one of the modifications from a previous feat. Each time you Cast the Spell corresponding to the feat you chose, you decide whether to cast its normal or modified version. You can only apply one modification to a spell at a time, even if you know more than one modification for that spell. Besides modifications mentioned in the feat, the spell functions as normal.</p>\n<p>Choose up to two 4th-level spell trickster archetype feats for which you meet the spell-casting prerequisite. You gain those feats, ignoring their level prerequisite.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the spell trickster archetype. The two feats you gain from taking the dedication don't count toward this total.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Agile Hand] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spell Trickster Dedication], ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mage Hand]</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast mage hand, you can modify its target to be a set of thieves' tools. When you Cast the Spell in this way, the tools move up to 20 feet towards a device or lock. After you Sustain the Spell on future turns, you can use the tools to attempt Thievery checks to Disable a Device or Pick a Lock within the spell's range, but you take a -2 penalty to your Thievery check. If you critically fail, the spell ends and you can't use this modification again for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Barrier Shield] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spell Trickster Dedication], ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Shield]</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast shield, you can modify the spell to create a solid barrier you can use for cover, but not for blocking. You can't use the Shield Block reaction when the spell is modified in this way, but you (and only you) can spend an action to Take Cover to gain standard cover from it.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Forceful Push] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spell Trickster Dedication], ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mage Hand]</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast mage hand, you can modify its target to be 1 creature. If you do, replace its standard effects with the following: You push your foe telekinetically. Make a spell attack roll against the target's Fortitude DC. On a success, you push the target 5 feet away from you. On a critical success, you push the target 10 feet away from you.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Shining Arms] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spell Trickster Dedication], ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Light]</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast light, you can modify its target to be 1 melee weapon, either unattended or possessed by you or a willing ally, and modify its duration to be 1 minute. If you do, add the following to its effects: When a creature wielding the weapon critically hits a foe, you can Dismiss the Spell as a reaction, causing the foe to be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] for 1 round. After you use this reaction, you can't use this modification again for 10 minutes.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Summon Ensemble] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spell Trickster Dedication], ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Summon Instrument]</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast summon instrument, you can modify its duration to be sustained, up to 1 minute. When you do, you summon a number of instruments equal to your spellcasting ability modifier that hover around you and play of their own accord. Once per turn when you Sustain the Spell, choose an opponent within 30 feet who can hear your performance. The target must attempt a Will save against the spell's DC; on a failure, it becomes distracted by your performance and becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Flat-Footed] for 1 round. The target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Tracing Sigil] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spell Trickster Dedication], ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Sigil]</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast sigil, you can modify the spell to add the following to its standard effects: The target leaves a magical trail that you and others can try to follow. You and other creatures can attempt to Track the target, substituting an Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check (whichever matches the magical tradition of your sigil spell) for the Survival check. Much like Tracking with Survival, this must take place somewhere the target has been and follow the trail; it doesn't allow anyone to find the target from a distance. You can only have a single target marked with a modified sigil in this way. If you use this ability again on a second target, the sigil spell on the first target ends, and your mark fades.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Wild Lights] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spell Trickster Dedication], ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Dancing Lights]</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast dancing lights, you can modify its duration to be 1 minute and modify its standard effects to create a single floating light in the shape of a Tiny creature, instead of up to four floating lights. The creature hovers over your head unless you spend a single action that has the concentrate trait to direct the light to move up to 30 feet, in which case it remains there until you direct it again. If you direct it back to your head, it hovers there and follows you again until you direct it elsewhere. If the light ever moves beyond 120 feet of you, it winks out immediately.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Animate Net] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spell Trickster Dedication], ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Animate Rope]</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast animate rope, you can modify its target to be 1 net. If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You cause a net to animate and throw itself at a Medium or smaller creature within 20 feet of the net. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's Reflex DC. On a success, the target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Flat-Footed] and takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it Escapes; on a critical success, it's also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] until it Escapes. The Escape DC is equal to your spell DC as long as the spell lasts. Once the spell ends, the Escape DC returns to the normal DC for a net (usually 16), and a creature adjacent to the target can Interact to remove the net.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Confounding Image] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spell Trickster Dedication], ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mirror Image]</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast mirror image, you can modify its duration to be sustained up to 1 minute and modify its range to 30 feet. If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You create an illusory duplicate of yourself that appears in an unoccupied square within range. The image takes up space and has a reach of 5 feet, and your allies can flank with the image. It doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have other than an AC equal to your spell DC and saving throw modifiers equal to your spell DC - 10. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, or if you ever move more than 30 feet from it, the spell ends. Creatures can move through its space without hindrance. When you Sustain the Spell, you can move the image to an unoccupied square within range.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Disk Rider] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spell Trickster Dedication], ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Floating Disk]</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast floating disk, you can modify its duration to be sustained, up to 10 minutes. If you do, add the following heightened entry to its effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> The disk can hold up to 10 Bulk. The spell no longer ends if you ride atop the disk (though it does if any other creature rides atop it, including if the creature is riding on you). If you are riding the disk, it changes its capacity to hold you, plus additional Bulk equal to the maximum you could carry without being encumbered.

They come from a tradition of ancient secrets and principles, which they temper with modern innovation and perspective. Spellshots combine magical power into the art of gunplay to create a distinct and mystical way known only to spellshots, enigmatic and unavailable to other gunslingers in the world at large. The first to identify themselves as spellshots tied their magical traditions to the history of the Star Code and the Crowned Regents in Arcadia. Ancient, reclusive crafters known as the Crowned Regents created star guns, the legendary magical firearms that shot white-hot blasts of energy. Wielders of star guns became bound together by the Star Code—a set of cultural expectations that defined how one should behave while using these powerful weapons. You can find more information about star guns, the Crowned Regents, and the Star Code in Guns &amp; Gears.</p>\n<p>Most spellshots continue to come from Arcadia, as the stories describing the relevant skills and training to become one have been passed down over the generations. Many gunslingers who grow up in this region hear of these tales early in their lives, and they develop the techniques to channel magical energy through their firearms in imitation of the Regents' arcane methods. While Arcadia is home to the vast majority of the world's spellshots, the techniques have slowly spread to other regions. However, spellshots remain particularly rare in the Inner Sea region due to the unique history of guns there and their connection to the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, which exists in a magic-dead region of the Mana Wastes.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spellshot Dedication] Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Way of the Spellshot]</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've steeped yourself in magic and gunplay to the extent that you can conjure bullets from thin air, using a rudimentary knowledge of arcane theory to create a temporary piece of ammunition.

                "content": "<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While many people across Golarion use prosthetic devices, you've acquired and outfitted yourself with a particularly advanced combat model of clockwork prosthesis: a piece of cutting edge technology called a sterling dynamo. You know how to maintain your dynamo and how to customize it to suit your needs and style, incorporating any promising new technologies you encounter into its design.</p>\n<p>There's a significant distinction, however, between someone who merely has a sterling dynamo prosthesis and someone like you who is a true sterling dynamo. With their recent invention, people in Absalom and Dongun Hold with access to the technology have begun to adopt sterling dynamos as their prostheses of choice, among the wide variety of amazing options already available in both markets. However, not everyone who chooses to use sterling dynamo technology is a member of the sterling dynamo archetype.</p>\n<p>With the sterling dynamo archetype, you both use a sterling dynamo prosthesis and truly understand its advantages, limitations, and limitless potential. You don't have to literally be your own mechanic, as there's no requirement for a sterling dynamo to be particularly skilled at crafting, but even if you aren't, you can still \"feel\" what's right when it comes to adjusting and optimizing your dynamo. Whether you implement these improvements yourself or present your mechanic with ideas and insights that allow them to achieve something special on your behalf, your strength and ingenuity are what make you a sterling dynamo.</p>\n<p>As you train to use your dynamo in all sorts of adventures, you may become capable of feats its original inventors never dreamed possible. In fact, as you progress in the archetype and explore the possibilities, you might find that these inventors want to interview you in order to apply your insights and help them create a new generation of the technology with even greater capabilities. The sterling dynamo's adaptability grants it vast potential, so the sky's the limit!</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Prosthetics in Golarion</h4>\n<p>Prosthetics in Golarion don't require membership in an archetype or special organization to obtain. A character can purchase a simple prosthetic foot, eye, hand, or virtually any other body part for as little as 5 silver pieces, with more expensive prosthetics that are decorated with unique customizations or designs available for a corresponding mark-up. For more information on prosthetics, see page 69 of Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar. The sterling dynamo prosthetic technology presented here was created through collaboration between a Dongun Hold prosthesis inventor, who created the flexible silvery clockwork joint system, and a researcher from the Clockwork Cathedral in Absalom, who created a prototype variant that increased how customizable the model was and sent it back to the dwarven inventor to iterate further. That iteration became the sterling dynamo that entered the market in late 4721 AR. It has been widely applauded for its adaptability in both combat and everyday use.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Sterling Dynamo Dedication] Feat 2</h2>\n<hr />\n<p>You obtain a sterling dynamo prosthetic, which allows you to replace or augment a limb, or even add a simple new non-prehensile limb, such as a tail. While your sterling dynamo prosthetic can replace a missing prehensile limb, such as an arm, choosing to add a new limb can never increases your character's number of hands or prehensile limbs beyond two, even in combination with other abilities or effects.</p>\n<p>Your sterling dynamo prosthesis is especially optimized for combat, granting you a dynamo melee unarmed attack that is in the brawling weapon group and is made of silver (which makes it more effective against certain types of creatures, such as devils and werewolves).</p>\n<p>You have several options to customize your sterling dynamo. First, choose whether you have a power driver dynamo, which deals [[/r 1d6[bludgeoning]]] damage and has the shove trait, or a percussive striker dynamo, which deals [[/r 1d4[bludgeoning]]] damage and has the agile and finesse traits. Most dynamos are automated, so they don't require a free hand to use, like other unarmed attacks. However, you can instead choose to make your dynamo be manually controlled via a handheld switch, lever, or other device; to make an attack with a manually controlled dynamo, you must have a hand free to operate it, but the benefit is great control and a more devastating strike. This increases the damage die by one size, to a 1d8 for a power drive dynamo or 1d6 for a percussive striker dynamo. Arm dynamos are always manual, but they use the hand on that arm to operate the dynamo when making strikes. Manual control is required only in the heat of combat, not for less strenuous adventuring or everyday activities.</p>\n<p>You need to keep your sterling dynamo wound, but the process isn't particularly onerous, so in most situations, it won't be an issue. If you spend 1 minute winding up your dynamo, it can remain active for 24 hours before needing additional winding. However, enemies can attempt to Disable the dynamo, which has a level equal to your own, to reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour, or 2 hours on a critical success. Certain other abilities that adversely affect technology might also reduce the dynamo's remaining operational time. When your dynamo is out of operational time, you can still use it as a normal prosthetic, but you cannot use your dynamo unarmed attack or any other abilities from this archetype until you wind the dynamo again. You can wind the dynamo for 1 minute at any time to return it to the maximum 24 hours of operational time.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the sterling dynamo archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Modular Dynamo] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Sterling Dynamo Dedication]</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your dynamo has modular configurations, allowing you to swap between various different possibilities with ease in order to adapt to various situations in combat. Your dynamo attack gains the modular trait, as well as one of the following configurations of your choice: power driver ([[/r 1d6[bludgeoning]]] damage; shove), percussive striker ([[/r 1d4[bludgeoning]]] damage; agile, finesse), rotating sickle ([[/r 1d6[slashing]]] damage; trip), or entangling barbs ([[/r 1d6[piercing]]] damage; grapple). If you have a manually controlled dynamo, these damage dice increase by 1 size, as usual, and you can also choose the extendable baton ([[/r 1d4[bludgeoning]]] damage; finesse, reach), which has the damage increase already factored in.</p>\n<p>When you use an Interact action to switch configurations using the modular trait, you switch between the initial configuration of dynamo you chose with the Sterling Dynamo Dedication and the new configuration you chose with Modular Dynamo.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, you choose another configuration and add it to the list of options you can choose when you use an Interact action with the modular trait.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Piston Punch] Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Sterling Dynamo Dedication]</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You lash out with a powerful punch, extending your dynamo to a greater length in order to attack two creatures in a row. Make a single bludgeoning or piercing dynamo Strike and compare the attack roll result to the ACs of up to two foes. The first foe must be within your melee reach and the second foe must be adjacent to the first foe in a straight line away from you. Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature you hit. A Piston Punch counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty. Reduce the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Stasian Smash] Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Sterling Dynamo Dedication]</p>\n<p><strong>Access</strong> You are from Ustalav.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've modified your dynamo with Stasian coils, allowing you to make a powerful attack that crackles with electricity. Make a dynamo Strike. On a success, the Strike deals an additional [[/r 1d12[electricity]]] damage to the target, as well as [[/r 1d4[electricity]]] damage to up to two other foes within 10 feet as sparks leap across the gaps. If you critically fail your dynamo Strike, you take [[/r 1d12[electricity]]] damage. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. At 18th level, the additional electricity damage to the target increases to 2d12, and the additional electricity damage to the other foes increases to [[/r 2d4]]{2d4}. Reduce the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Beast Dynamo Howl] Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Sterling Dynamo Dedication]</p>\n<p><strong>Access</strong> You are from Arcadia.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've incorporated beast tech from Arcadia into your dynamo, adding in components from various terrifying creatures to enhance your prosthesis's capabilities. The beast parts can unleash a disturbing howl as you make a powerful attack with your dynamo. Attempt a single Intimidation check to Demoralize each enemy within 30 feet; you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language. Then, make a dynamo Strike. Reduce the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Golem Dynamo] Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Sterling Dynamo Dedication]</p>\n<p><strong>Access</strong> You are an automaton or are otherwise from the ancient Jistka Imperium.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned the secrets of Jistkan golem prostheses, allowing you to incorporate golem components into your dynamo and gain a portion of their magic. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against magic, and your dynamo Strikes become magical.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Soaring Dynamo] Feat 18</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Sterling Dynamo Dedication]</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've built clockwork wings or jets into your dynamo, allowing you to use your prosthesis to fly. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. Each minute of flight reduces the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour, measured from the first time you use the Fly action in a given minute.</p>",

But magic is so much more than that-it is thought, will, and action, and with the right talismans, you can make even the cut of a sword a deeply magical act. This all hinges on the small magical talismans you affix to your gear. You know how to make and use the perfect talismans for any job.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Talisman Dabbler Dedication] Feat 2</h2>\n<p>You are trained in the use of talismans and similar magical paraphernalia. This training might have occurred in a formal classroom or been an agglomeration of folk magic picked up over time. You can craft talismans and know the formulas for all common talismans in the Core Rulebook of your level or lower. You remember talisman formulas and don't need a formula book for them.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you carry a collection of magical baubles you can turn into temporary talismans. Each day during your daily preparations, you can make two talismans with an item level no higher than half your level. You must know each talisman's formula. A talisman created this way is a temporary item and loses its magic the next time you make your daily preparations if you haven't already used it.</p>\n<p>Finally, when you Affix a Talisman, you can (in any combination) affix or remove up to four talismans in the 10-minute span.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Talisman Dabbler archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Quick Fix] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Talisman Dabbler Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can attach a talisman using only a bit of glue and some string.

Your snares include clockwork and steam-powered cogwheels and gears, and their gush of steam can hinder those you ensnare. If you choose to construct a snare using gears and a creature fails their saving throw against the snare, all creatures are concealed to that creature for 1 round, as a burst of steam obscures its vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the snarecrafter or trapsmith archetypes.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Gear Gnash] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Trapsmith Dedication], expert in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Snares you create have complicated inner workings that are quite difficult to disable. Creatures attempting to Disable your snares that use gears must succeed at an additional Thievery check in order to disable the snare.

When you construct a snare using gears, you can cause it to trigger based on the visual features of a creature. For example, you could lay a snare that can only be triggered by a Large or Larger creatures, or one that only activates when a creature wearing red clothing would trigger it. You can use this ability to specify your snares to trigger on creatures that typically do not trigger snares, such as creatures smaller than Small, though the creature must still otherwise satisfy the snare's trigger as normal.</p>",

Contrary to the usual rules for companions, as an undead master it's possible for you to have more than one undead companion at a time. However, only one of those companions, your \"active companion,\" follows you during exploration and encounters; the rest are reduced to an \"inactive\" state that can be easily tucked into an inventory or stored in a nearby crypt.

Many adventurers are skilled at dispatching undead, but you go a step further. You study them, learn their weaknesses, and master the tools to end them quickly and cleanly. An undead slayer doesn't simply kill monsters; they become what even monsters fear. Leave it to others to be a shield-you become the blade that strikes evil at its heart. You can identify the common types of undead by sight. You drill and practice with the special gear necessary to destroy some of the more complicated undead, like vampires; train in their strengths and weaknesses; and learn how to create safe houses to stash your arsenal and hide from undead.</p>\n<p>Some undead slayers work at the behest of an organization to exterminate the undead of a particular region, but many act independently, or in a group of like‑minded adventurers.

The sanctum is roughly the size of a 20-foot cube. This sanctum is in a location you have access to and can be part of a larger structure, such as the basement of a temple or hidden room of a library.

Make a Strike against a creature you know is undead. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If this Strike hits, you deal one extra die of positive damage, with the same die size as the weapon or unarmed attack you used. Any further Strikes you make against the same creature before the start of your next turn using the same weapon or unarmed attack deal extra positive damage equal to the number of weapon dice.

Your character at first seems like they bumble into their successes through sheer circumstance. However, when the circumstances pile up, others might start to suspect another possibility: perhaps your character is secretly so incredible that they not only achieve impressive results but do so in a way that hides their skill behind a veneer of lucky breaks. Ultimately, either could be true about your character, or some combination of both. You might decide the truth together with the GM as soon as you take this archetype or hold off until later to make that call. Because this archetype hints at hidden talent intentionally obfuscated, it offers a good choice for a character who's secretly more powerful or skilled than they seem or who must hide their abilities for some reason-perhaps associated with the plot of the campaign.</p>\n<p>If your inclination is to play a character who hides their abilities, consider training in the Deception skill and taking skill feats like Charming Liar and Confabulator that emphasize your character's crafty nature and skill at concealing their true intent.</p>\n<p>If you instead prefer to play a character who's legitimately a bit uncoordinated but abnormally lucky, you might choose to pursue actions that have a high chance of earning you a Hero Point.

Whatever the exact chain reaction, and no matter how improbable, the indiscriminate catastrophe creates significant challenges for your enemies across a wide area while leaving everyone else alone.</p>\n<p>Make a Strike with a ranged weapon, and if you hit, you can make another Strike at a target within 30 feet of the first target. If you hit the second target, attempt to Strike a third target within 30 feet of the second target, and so on, continuing until you miss a target. You can cease the chain at any point; otherwise, it ends when you first miss an attack. However, you can't target the same creature more than once; each time you move to a new target, it must be a target you haven't made a Strike against yet during this particular use of Chain Reaction.</p>\n<p>This damage is caused by some improbable set of events that injures one target after another, rather than from actually making several shots. Perhaps you shot at a tree branch that then fell on the targets, or one target's scream caused another to accidentally set off their gun and shoot themselves in the foot. This means that only the first target suffers any special effects tied to the bullet (if it was magical ammunition, for example), but each target you hit still takes the same damage dealt by your Strike. Normally, all damage is of the same damage type as the initial bullet. However, the GM might choose to change the damage type based on their description of the chain reaction. For example, if one target was burned by fire, that target might take fire damage instead of physical damage.</p>",

While you can make a great profit working on custom vehicles for wealthy clients, you still keep a vehicle of your own to tinker with as your personal passion project.</p>\n<p>You might be part of a vehicle mechanic union, working with other mechanics and engineers to find fair jobs and support each other's labor. While some vehicle mechanic unions are secular, many realize the benefits of organizing alongside a sympathetic religion, and so they typically adopt the ideals of economically-focused gods like Abadar or deities interested in crafting such as the goddess Brigh—the Whisper in Bronze—the goddess of invention. Whether religious or secular, vehicle mechanic unions take the bonds between fellow union members seriously.

Almenia Oarstone (LG female dwarf shipwright) is the current leader of the union, having been a member for more than 60 years. It is said that you can count on one hand the number of ships that have docked in Absalom on which she has never worked.

In this way, the vehicle mechanic archetype pairs excellently with a PC who has chosen the trick driver archetype. Vehicles are an element you should consider carefully before deciding to include, even in a guns and gears campaign. Vehicles are relatively complicated and can move very fast, which may make mapping encounters quite difficult. They can also move characters too far from the fight for other participants to respond.

Pilots, crew, and passengers of the vehicle gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells until the start of the pilot's next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Pulled</strong> You have eased the amount of effort needed for those pulling your signature vehicle to move it. The vehicle gains a +10 circumstance bonus to its Speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Rowed</strong> Reinforced ports protect the rowers below decks from harm. Rowers of your signature vehicle who are below decks have greater cover from attacks from outside the vehicle and are not damaged when the vehicle takes collision damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Steam</strong> The outlet of steam forms a cloud around the vehicle as it moves. For the duration of its movement, your signature vehicle is concealed.</p>\n<p><strong>Wind</strong> The draft of the wind helps the vehicle turn. During this movement, your signature vehicle can turn normally, rather than needing to move in a straight line as normal for a 2- or 3-action Drive.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Efficient Controls] Feat 7</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Vehicle Mechanic Dedication], master in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>By reducing redundant systems and streamlining essential functions, you have made it easier for the vehicle to operate with fewer crew. Reduce the number of crew required to operate your signature vehicle by 25%. For example, you would reduce a sailing ship from needing 1 pilot and 8 crew to 1 pilot and 6 crew. This adjustment only affects the number of crew needed to operate the vehicle; it doesn't reduce the vehicle's need for a pilot.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Impervious Vehicle] Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Vehicle Mechanic Dedication]</p>\n<hr />\n<p>From armor plating and flexible components, to reinforced materials and backup redundant functionality, you have built safeguards to protect your vehicle from the rigors of combat. Your signature vehicle gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and Fortitude saves, and increases its Hit Points by an amount equal to twice your level.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Miraculous Flight] Feat 18</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Vehicle Mechanic Dedication]</p>\n<hr />\n<p>With superior engineering and magical application, you have freed your signature vehicle from the bonds of gravity, allowing it to soar through the sky like a dragon. The vehicle gains magical propulsion and a fly Speed equal to its fastest current Speed. If your signature vehicle already had a fly Speed, reduce the distance the vehicle needs to make a 90-degree turn to half the usual length (typically half the length of the vehicle).</p>",

                "content": "<p>As a vigilante, you have two faces: a public persona, and a secret identity that lets you hide your extralegal actions from polite society. Your secret identity lets you adventure and carry out clandestine missions while keeping the civilians you care about safe. Whatever your purpose- fighting crime, inciting rebellion, sowing chaos-your vigilante identity makes you both hard to pin down and a mysterious, intriguing subject of gossip.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats</strong> 4th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Quick Draw]</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Vigilante Dedication] Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Deception</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have two identities, each with its own name, alignment, and abilities. Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these people, and as such, your two identities can be at most one alignment step from each other (for instance, you could be neutral in one identity and neutral evil in the other, but not chaotic evil in the other). If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they must use a Seek action to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC, as if you were using the Impersonate action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC. Unlike with Impersonate, you don't have to attempt a Deception check to interact with someone to conceal your other identity-a check happens only if someone else specifically tries to uncover your other identity.</p>\n<p>Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don't reduce the time required to change identities.</p>\n<p>Your two identities are completely distinct. You have your current identity's alignment for effects that rely on alignment, though you are eligible for abilities that require a certain alignment (such as a cleric's deity) only if both of your identities qualify. Checks to Recall Knowledge about one of your identities don't reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the check knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity, such as the detect alignment spell, work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn't exist.</p>\n<p>To maintain the separation between your identities, some of your abilities have one of two traits: social or vigilante. You can use social feats only while in your social identity. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity risks exposing you as a vigilante. This means that if you were particularly meek or inconspicuous before you took this feat, your identity could be at greater risk of exposure. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can otherwise use both social and vigilante abilities in either identity unless they rely on your identity being a secret. You can use feats that don't have either trait regardless of your current identity.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Vigilante archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Hidden Magic] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion; Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned to hide the magical auras of your gear. During your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your magic items to appear non-magical. Objects adjusted in this way remain so until your next preparations. A spellcaster using detect magic or read aura must succeed at a Perception check against your Deception DC to see through your obfuscations.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Minion Guise] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> animal companion or familiar, expert in Deception, Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you are in your social identity, you can also grant a social identity to an animal companion, familiar, or other minion you gained from a class feature. When changing to your social identity, you also change your minion's appearance to that of a socially acceptable creature of its type, such as grooming a wolf to appear as a large dog or disguising a familiar to appear as an exotic pet. Commanding your minion to use unusual magical or combat abilities it gained from your class features or feats while in this social identity risks exposing your vigilante identity.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Safe House] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You establish a safe house-a secure space in which to hide your secrets from the outside world. This safe house is roughly the size of a 10-foot cube. It's in a location you have access to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a hidden room or an underground cave. The safe house protects objects and people inside it from magical detection. This has the effects of nondetection, using your Deception modifier for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the counteract level. Setting up or moving your safe house takes a week of downtime. The size of the safe house expands to four 10-foot cubes if you're an expert in Deception, eight cubes if you're a master, and 16 cubes if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Social Purview] Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have built a reputation for yourself in your social identity. Choose one archetype that you meet the prerequisites for. You gain that archetype's dedication feat and can select feats from that archetype, even if you haven't yet gained enough feats in the vigilante archetype to take another dedication feat. These feats become part of your social identity and gain the social trait-for instance, a fighter vigilante could take the wizard dedication feat and have a wizard social identity. Using these feats in your social identity doesn't risk exposing your vigilante identity, but using them in your vigilante identity could put you at risk for exposure.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Startling Appearance (Vigilante)]{Startling Appearance} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are completely unnoticed by the target creature.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can startle foes who are unaware of your presence. Make a Strike against your target. That creature is flat-footed against this Strike, as normal. If your Strike hits, the target remains flat-footed for the rest of your turn and is frightened 1 (frightened 2 on a critical hit).</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Quick Change] Feat 7</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in Deception, Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can shift between your identities with ease. Instead of spending 1 minute to change your identity, you can now do so as a 3-action activity. If you are legendary in Deception, you can perform this change as a 1-action activity.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Subjective Truth] Feat 7</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in Deception, Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your disparate identities allow you to defeat magic that detects lies. As long as what you say is true from the point of view of your current identity, you can say it even under effects like zone of truth that force you to speak the truth.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Many Guises] Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in Deception, Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever you change your identity, instead of taking on your social or vigilante identity, you can become someone completely ordinary. This identity isn't a specific individual-rather, you become a nondescript member of your ancestry, of any gender, with a neutral alignment and a mundane occupation such as common laborer, farmer, or peasant. Spells and abilities detect you as if you were this ordinary identity, rather than either of your two real identities, unless they succeed at a counteract check against your Deception DC. You can't use either social abilities or vigilante abilities while in this identity.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Frightening Appearance] Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Intimidation, Startling Appearance</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your dramatic appearances can frighten bystanders. When you make a Startling Appearance, you can also attempt to Demoralize each opponent within 10 feet to whom you were unnoticed before your Strike.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Stunning Appearance] Feat 16</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Startling Appearance</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your sudden appearance leaves your foe unable to respond. When you use Startling Appearance, if your foe's level is equal to or lower than yours, they are also stunned 1 on a hit, or stunned 2 on a critical hit.</p>",

Specializing in a variety of grabs, holds, and strikes, wrestlers are dangerous opponents whose techniques can leave a foe broken and defeated without taking their life.</p>\n<p>The wrestling tradition is common all over Golarion. Gladiators and other warriors who fight for entertainment use wrestling techniques in combat. The discipline's focus on grappling is also useful in non-gladiatorial matches, as many foes are unable to contend with an opponent's hold. Grappling is particularly effective against spellcasters, who have a difficult time completing the somatic components of their spells while grabbed.</p>\n<p>Wrestlers have storied traditions in the Hold of Belkzen, where orcs use specialized grappling techniques to subdue the large animals they ride as mounts. Orcs prefer wrestling these creatures partially to minimize harm to them, but also because they believe that the process of subduing the creature creates a stronger bond between mount and rider.</p>\n<p>Outside of the Inner Sea, wrestlers are common in Iblydos and Arcadia. Iblydan wrestlers focus on grappling techniques to make sure they're never left without a means to fight on the battlefield, even if their weapons are destroyed. Arcadian wrestlers engage in matches designed to retell stories of ancient gods. These matches feature impressive acrobatic feats as well as highly technical grappling maneuvers.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats</strong> 4th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Combat Grab], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Crushing Grab], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Snagging Strike]; 8th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Whirling Throw]</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Wrestler Dedication] Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Athletics, unarmed attacks, and unarmored defense</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your training in the wrestling arts has made you particularly adept at moving, striking, and grappling while unencumbered.

                "content": "<h1>Mummy</h1><p>Mummification is a common funereal rite across the breadth of Golarion throughout the ages. Becoming a living mummy - one capable of both motion and thought - is another thing altogether.</p><p>Most of those forced into undeath as mummies are bound to tombs, temples, and vaults as guardians. Some willingly undergo the process, embracing death to live beyond it. These willing mummies become the most powerful of their kind, rising above their brethren like an emperor above their subjects.</p><p>The horrifically painful living mummification process must be performed by others - usually a team of well-trained necromancers, priests, or ritualists - upon a still-living subject. Death by mummification is gruesome, but to be kept alive for as long as possible throughout the process is a thousandfold worse. The process usually takes weeks, beginning with forced starvation, followed by the consumption of spices and tonics that desiccate the subject's internal organs.</p><p>Very rarely, mummies are created by natural processes occurring in locations that are cursed or inundated by negative energy. These mummies most often rise in deserts, bogs, swamps, at high altitudes, or in frigid locales. Although the process through which they are created is less painful and far shorter in duration, the spiritual shift from living to undead is no less traumatizing.</p><p>Mummies are most commonly found in Geb and Osirion, as well as the surrounding nations of Thuvia, Katapesh, and Qadira. They have a foothold in the Gravelands, the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, and the Mwangi Expanse, particularly around Mzali.

You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Toughness] feat, but also fire weakness equal to half your level.</p><p>Your fist draws moisture from the living by touch, making it more damaging and deadly. The damage die for your fist increases to 1d6 instead of 1d4, and your fist loses the nonlethal trait.</p><p>Finally, you become supernaturally bound to the dominant terrain in which you were created, either because you formed naturally from the weather of that terrain or because of the local ingredients and methods used in an intentional mummification process.

In addition to the benefits of your Aid, the triggering ally rolls their Deception check twice and takes the better result. This is a fortune effect.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Change of Face] Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Alter Ego Dedication</p><hr /><p>You know that for the best disguise to work, one requires not only the right skills but also the right look-luckily you can copy both using special magical techniques. When you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Impersonate], you don't need a disguise kit; instead, simple illusions or temporary transmutations ripple over your body like mirror shards, providing the supplies that the kit ordinarily would. When you Impersonate in this way, your Impersonate activity gains the occult trait.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Fake It Till You Make It] Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Alter Ego Dedication</p><hr /><p>When you take on a role, you become more capable with all sorts of tasks involving that role. When you Assume a Role, choose two skills associated with the role in some way; if you're untrained, you can use your level as your proficiency bonus for those skills, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with those skills as long as you remain in that role.

You can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Silence]</em> on yourself as a 2nd-level innate occult spell and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ventriloquism]</em> as a 1st-level innate occult spell, both once per day. You also can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ghost Sound]</em> as an innate occult cantrip.

You lose this benefit if you don't use it before the end of your next turn.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Swap Reflections] Feat 8</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Alter Ego Dedication</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per 10 minutes</p><hr /><p>You've learned how to use even your reflection to your advantage. You send your own reflection to forcibly swap places with the reflection of an enemy, pulling each of you through opposite ends and switching places. The enemy must be within 120 feet, you must both be adjacent to reflective surfaces (such as glass, mirrors, or calm water), and you must be able to see the target's reflection and have line of effect to it. The target attempts a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] save against your spell DC or class DC, whichever is higher.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The spell has no effect.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> You swap positions with your target or arrive adjacent to your target, whichever your target prefers.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> You swap positions with your target or arrive adjacent to your target, whichever you prefer.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You instantaneously swap positions with your target, and the target becomes trapped in its own reflection for 1 minute. Once on each of its turns, the target can spend 1 action to attempt another Will save to escape. If the save succeeds, the effect ends early.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Illusory Identity] Feat 12</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Alter Ego Dedication</p><p><strong>Access</strong> Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.</p><hr /><p>There are times when skills or looks are not enough to convince someone of your identity, and you instead require adequate documentation. Replicating the methods of the Sapphire Butterfly, you've learned to use magic to forge a new identity as you need it. During your daily preparations, you can choose a blank piece of paper, journal, badge, or similar item normally used to display authority, to magically invest. You can use an Interact action to mentally outline the basic information that is displayed when that item is presented to another creature, such as a name, a title, connection to an existing group or agency, and other basic details. A more complex outline requires more time, at the GM's discretion. That creature must attempt a Will save against your Deception DC. This item only works while you are holding it and appears blank if anyone else attempts to use it, though you can include others within the details of your outline.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target sees the item as being entirely blank, and becomes immune to this effect until your next daily preparations.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> The target sees only the basic information listed out in a simplistic manner, as described in the Interact action. Though not fully convinced, the target plays along, but this worsens the target's attitude toward you by one step.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> The target sees the information presented by the item in the proper format relevant to your situation, with the appropriate language, names, dates, signatures, and other details.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target sees the information presented by the item as granting a higher level of authority than anticipated, and immediately treats you with the proper deference. As failure, and the target's attitude toward you immediately improves by one step.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Borrow Memories] Feat 14</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Alter Ego Dedication</p><hr /><p>Knowing how someone thinks makes it much easier to know where they'll be, or even replace them altogether. You can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mind Probe]</em> as an innate occult spell once per day, using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.</p><p>If you cast <em>mind probe</em> on a target you're studying for the purpose of Assuming their Role, and the target fails their save, you can delay the spell from coming into effect until you Assume their Role. When you use the spell this way, you can Sustain it up to 10 times during its duration, asking a question each time. The spell lasts until you ask all 10 questions or are no longer Assuming the Role, whichever comes first. You don't need to Sustain the Spell to extend its duration-only when asking a question-nor do you need to be in range or have line of effect to Sustain it.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.It Was Me All Along!] Feat 14</h2><p><strong>Frequency </strong>once per day</p><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Alter Ego Dedication, or Vigilante Dedication</p><p><strong>Access </strong>Members of the Firebrands at the rank of second mark or higher have access to this feat.</p><p><strong>Requirements </strong>Your identity is hidden, either by magic or a disguise.</p><hr /><p>You discard a disguise and dramatically reveal your true identity, catching your foes off guard. If you created your disguise using magic such as with humanoid form or illusory disguise, you immediately Dismiss the spell as a free action. Stride up to your speed and attempt a Deception check to Feint one target within 30 feet. If you succeed, you roll twice and take the better result on your first attack roll against that target this turn.</p>",

You, however, somehow fell out of the flow of time, if only for an instant, but in doing so gained a perspective that few others have.<br /><br />Now you stand on the banks of the river, watching the flow, choosing where to dive in, or even defying the current, at least for a short while, as you skim its surface and skip from moment to moment. As a chronoskimmer, time is yours to exploit.</p><p>You have the means to see the timelines of all creatures, including your own. You can use this insight to manipulate the flow of time for creatures, much like you can pluck the leaf from the river and place it elsewhere. Manipulating timelines can be dangerous, however, and the Dimension of Time isn't wont to allow these transgressions against time to stand forever. The threat always looms of time dimensionals coming to correct your actions or of you becoming removed from time forever.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Chronoskimmer Dedication] Feat 2</h2><p>You became partially unstuck from time and have learned how to manipulate your place in flow of time. When you roll initiative, you can choose one of three options: either do nothing and roll initiative normally, stabilize your timestream, or destabilize your timestream and send it into intense fluctuations. If you choose to stabilize your timestream, you don't roll initiative, and instead your initiative is equal to 10 + your initiative modifier. If you choose to destabilize your timestream, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:11]. On a success, your initiative is equal to 19 + your initiative modifier, and on a failure, your initiative is equal to 1 + your initiative modifier. Both stabilizing and destabilizing your timestream are fortune effects.</p><p>Additionally, if your initiative roll result is tied with an opponent's initiative roll, you go first. Your manipulation of time grants you access to a number of abilities, some of which require a saving throw. The DC for these abilities is either your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, and is called your chronoskimmer DC.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the chronoskimmer archetype.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Turn Back the Clock] Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Chronoskimmer Dedication</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><p><strong>Trigger</strong> You fail a skill check or saving throw.</p><hr /><p>After failing a test of skill, you hop back in your personal timeline so you can try again.

Choose an ally or a foe. If you choose an ally, the next time within the next round that ally makes an attack roll or skill check, they roll it twice and take the higher result; this is a fortune effect. If you choose a foe, the next time within the next round that foe makes an attack roll or skill check, they must roll twice and take the lower result unless they succeed at a Will save against your chronoskimmer DC; this is a misfortune effect. Regardless of your choice, the target becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Reversing Charge] Feat 8</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Chronoskimmer Dedication</p><hr /><p>You dive into the fray before rewinding yourself to safety. Stride up to your Speed. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee Strike against that enemy. You then teleport back to the square from which you began your Snapback Charge. You can use Reversing Charge while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Superimpose Time Duplicates] Feat 8</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Chronoskimmer Dedication</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p><hr /><p>You call alternate versions of yourself, either from a different timeline or perhaps yourself from a different point in your current timeline, to aid you in combat. Until the start of your next turn, these alternate selves flicker in and out in your vicinity, providing flanking for you against all enemies within your reach. Flanking with your time duplicates is the same as flanking with an ally and so is subject to effects like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.All-Around Vision] or the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Deny Advantage] class feature.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Borrow Time] Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Chronoskimmer Dedication</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute</p><p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your turn begins.</p><hr /><p>You reach ahead and make use of time that's yet to be. You become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Quickened] and can use the extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike. You gain this extra action immediately and can use it this turn. At the end of your turn, you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 1}.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Steal Time] Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Chronoskimmer Dedication</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p><hr /><p>You reach into another creature's timeline and attempt to alter their flow of time.

The creature takes the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Slow]</em> based on the result of its saving throw.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Combat Premonition] Feat 12</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Chronoskimmer Dedication</p><hr /><p>By narrowing your sense of the future, you can improve that of your allies. When you roll initiative, instead of stabilizing or destabilizing your own timestream, you can grant your allies a flash of insight into their future. Choose two allies. Those allies roll their initiative roll twice and take the better result; this is a fortune effect. You roll your initiative roll twice and take the worse result; this is a misfortune effect. The two effects are tied together: if you would avoid the misfortune effect for any reason, or if any of your allies would negate their fortune effect, your Combat Premonition does nothing.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Escape Timeline] Feat 12</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Chronoskimmer Dedication</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your turn begins.</p><hr /><p>You step outside of the flow of time momentarily, allowing you to avoid dangers. Your physical form stops existing momentarily, and you can't be targeted or affected until the start of your next turn-you simply don't exist at that moment in time. Your turn ends immediately, advancing 1 round for all timed durations and effects, such as conditions and afflictions. You still attempt saving throws, flat checks, or any other checks at the end of your turn as normal, but you don't take any damage due to these checks (though you take any non-damaging effects as normal). At the start of your next turn, you reenter the flow of time and reappear in the same space where you left time last round.

Your Strides are augmented until the end of your turn, allowing you to instantly teleport to any point you could reach with your @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Stride] instead of traversing normally to the location. Your augmented Strides have the teleport trait and don't trigger reactions that can be triggered by move actions or upon leaving or entering a square.

Your reanimated clockwork corpses are stable, effective, and, more importantly, they don't rampage or crave the flesh of the living in the same way an undead would. Plus, they aren't vulnerable to positive energy, making them easier to use around good clerics and their ilk without your minions taking friendly fire. (Except Pharasmins, always so inconveniently up in arms about the whole “desecrating the bodies of the dead” thing. They can't learn the difference between the stench of undeath and the smell of progress.)</p><p></p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Clockwork Reanimator Dedication] Feat 2</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>trained in Crafting</p><hr /><p>You can animate corpses through cunning engineering. You gain a prototype construct companion to serve as a minion. Unlike normal construct companions, yours is a corpse animated by clockwork gears and technological prowess.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the clockwork reanimator archetype.

It becomes an advanced construct companion. During an encounter, even if you don't use the Command a Minion action, your construct companion can still use 1 action on your turn that round to Stride or Strike.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Hijack Undead] Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Clockwork Reanimator Dedication</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p><hr /><p>Your clockwork devices can commandeer the bodies of undead, bending them to your will. Make a melee Strike against an adjacent undead creature. On a success, instead of taking damage, the target becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Controlled] by you if its level is equal to or lower than your level - 3. It can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC to resist being controlled by you. If the target is already under someone else's command, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw, and the undead uses the better result.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected and temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> The undead creature becomes a minion under your control for 1 minute. The control ends if you or an ally attacks the minion undead.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.It's Alive!] Feat 6</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Clockwork Reanimator Dedication</p><hr /><p>You've mastered the use of electrical energy to power your clockwork creations. Whenever your construct companion takes electricity damage, it gains temporary Hit Points equal to either half the electricity damage it took or your level, whichever is lower. These temporary Hit Points last for up to 1 minute.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Incredible Reanimated Companion] Feat 8</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Clockwork Reanimator Dedication</p><hr /><p>You imbue the necrotized flesh of your reanimated construct companion with strange chemicals and fine-tune the clockwork within, enhancing all its capabilities. It becomes an incredible construct companion.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Self Destruct] Feat 12</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Clockwork Reanimator Dedication</p><p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your reanimated clockwork companion is reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're within 60 feet of your reanimated clockwork companion.</p><hr /><p>You've installed a self-destruct device within your construct companion, which you can trigger with a special device from up to 60 feet away. When you activate the device, your reanimated construct companion explodes, dealing [[/r 2d6[fire]]] damage per level to all creatures in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]{30-foot radius}. Creatures caught in the blast can attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] save, with a DC equal to the higher of your class DC or spell DC.</p><p>[[/r ((2*@actor.level)d6)[fire]]]{Leveled Fire Damage}</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Hijack Undead] Feat 14</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Clockwork Reanimator Dedication, Hijack Undead</p><hr /><p>Undead creatures find it all but impossible to resist your commands. When you use Hijack Undead, if the undead fails its save, it becomes your minion for 10 minutes. If it critically fails, it becomes your minion for 24 hours.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Paragon Reanimated Companion] Feat 14</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Incredible Reanimated Companion</p><hr /><p>You have reached the pinnacle of necromantic science, creating a mechanical zombie unlike any the world has seen before. Your reanimated construct companion becomes a paragon construct companion.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Unwind Death] Feat 16</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Clockwork Reanimator Dedication</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> The target's body must be mostly intact.</p><hr /><p>Combining necromancy with the mysterious temporal powers of clockwork, you wind a creature backward from the moment of its death. Attempt a @Check[type:crafting|dc:40] check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Raise Dead]</em>, except it still has the wounded condition it had before dying, increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is then temporarily immune to Unwind Death for 1 day.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Zombie Horde] Feat 20</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Clockwork Reanimator Dedication</p><hr /><p>You built your reanimated construct companion of modular components from various corpses. Its unique makeup enables your companion to split into dozens or even hundreds of much smaller corpse constructs. Acting as one, this shambling swarm can overwhelm your enemies.</p><p>You Command your reanimated construct companion. Instead of its normal actions, the companion splits into a horde of Small and Tiny construct companions within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30] from its original space. The horde makes a Strike against each foe within the emanation with a +2 circumstance bonus to its attack rolls. The multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after the companion makes all the attacks. The miniature companions recombine into a single companion of their original size at any location within the emanation.</p>",

You can choose to suppress it, but if you instead let it manifest, you can channel its power in your favor.

You presented yourself before their altar and they answered your call, flooding your body with their power and granting you the gift of their original form. Or maybe you were abducted in the dark, on a night that the moon refused to shine, when you were taken to a profane location where a mysterious cult bound you to their master against your will. Now you have powers you didn't before and you have new features that scare (and maybe, in a small dark part of your heart, thrill) you.</p><p>You might have even become a living vessel through a strange bargain. For instance, perhaps at the brink of death, you received an offer from an entity to spare your life in exchange for inhabiting you. Or you might have offered yourself to the entity in exchange for saving a loved one, for riches, or to fulfill a lifelong dream.</p><p>Beings of any alignment can inhabit a living vessel. Evil-aligned beings, especially demons, are most likely to be interested in such an arrangement, especially if it involves forcefully taking over and changing the body and mind of a sapient being. Part of being a living vessel is learning more about your entity and finding what assuages them best and what their ultimate plans might be for your body and the world. Few vessels can fully dictate the terms of the arrangement, but the fact that you give the entity a corporeal form does give you some amount of leverage. Use it wisely.</p><p><strong>Additional Feats</strong> Your GM might determine that you can take a pact feat from the pactbinder archetype as an additional feat, as long as the pact is made to the entity within you. For instance, if you're hosting a fey, you could make a pact involving fey. These pact feats are at the same level as for a pactbinder.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Living Vessel Dedication] Feat 2</h2><p>Whether willingly or not, you've become a vessel for a being of unimaginable power. You and your GM should work together to determine the being's nature and decide how much you know and how much remains a mystery to you for now. Some decisions might influence your options later. You might need to decide whether the entity is a demon, for instance, to know if you qualify for later feats.</p><p>You need to spend at least an hour each day assuaging the entity within you or you take a -1 penalty to Will saves for 24 hours. The process of assuaging the entity is determined together between you and the GM.

But why fight what you can't change? You prefer to bargain.</p><p>As a pactbinder, you make deals with strange entities, otherworldly beings, and all sorts of multiversal denizens, amiable and unapproachable alike. Over the course of your many negotiations, you've learned something important: while such beings always seek a bargain tilted in their own favor, sometimes your definition of value differs enough from theirs that you can still come out ahead. In fact, sometimes, those who don't understand pacts like you do might mistake the payment for the benefit, or vice versa. Perhaps an ancient being of nightmare demanded to consume something you sought to be rid of, like a painful memory or a negative personality trait, priding itself on how it was taking something personal from you. Little did it know, you let it win on haggling your end of the deal. Of course, this practice isn't without its own risks, as who knows what you might become without that part of you.</p><p>All these things, you can and must consider in every pact. In addition to pacts, you might also pursue magical contracts. While less of a metaphysical commitment than a pact, contracts offer similar benefits you just can't resist— and you can employ your skill set as a pactbinder to manipulate the precise wording of the bargain.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pactbinder Dedication] Feat 2</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Diplomacy as well as either Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion</p><hr /><p>The first step toward forming a successful pact is an understanding of the magic behind it, along with skill at negotiation. It doesn't hurt that you also learned how to magically bind yourself to keep your word, enabling you to bargain more easily. You increase your proficiency from trained to expert in Diplomacy and in one of the following: Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Binding Vow]</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the pactbinder archetype.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pact of Fey Glamour] Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Pactbinder Dedication</p><hr /><p>You've sworn a pact with fey powers, granting you the otherworldly appearance of your dreams in exchange for oaths of hospitality. As long as you keep your end of the bargain, your base appearance changes indefinitely to any one appearance you wish that's within the bounds of possibility for your ancestry; this effect can't be counteracted or removed except by violating the pact. Additionally, you can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Illusory Disguise]</em> as a primal innate spell once per hour, using the higher of your class DC and your spell DC to determine the DC.</p><p>In exchange, you promise to accept any fey's request for hospitality, granting them food, drink, and lodging for up to 3 days and 3 nights. You also promise not to harm any creature to whom you've offered hospitality or who has shown hospitality to you, whether or not that creature is fey, unless that creature does harm first. If you refuse hospitality to a fey or violate hospitality, you lose the benefits of this feat until you atone for your transgressions, instantly reverting your appearance to the one you had before the pact.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Sociable Vow] Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Pactbinder Dedication; expert in Diplomacy</p><hr /><p>You can leverage your vow in more social interactions.

You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Dragon Breath] activity. In exchange, you promise to search for objects the dragon wants for its hoard upon request. These requests might be extremely specific unique objects, or they might be a broad category of objects. While the dragon agrees to pay you a fair price for the item you retrieve, the pact requires you to give your time and service.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pact of Infernal Prowess] Feat 8</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Pactbinder Dedication</p><hr /><p>You've sworn a pact with devils, granting you success in life in exchange for your soul in the afterlife.

Additionally, you can choose to automatically succeed at checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Earn Income] for tasks below your level, without rolling. However, when you die, your soul is consigned to Hell. You can't be returned to life except by powerful magic such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Miracle]</em>, and even then, the devils responsible for the contract can track your every move for 1 year. The devils gain the effects of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Discern Location]</em> spell. They can also use 10th-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Scrying]</em> on you at will, and you automatically critically fail your saving throw.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> You can't retrain out of a Pact of Infernal Prowess without journeying to Hell and destroying the devil's written contract spelling out the terms of your pact.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pact of the Final Breath] Feat 12</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Pactbinder Dedication</p><hr /><p>You've sworn a pact with a powerful psychopomp-typically an olethros advocate or yamaraj judge-granting you a reprieve before your soul will be collected in exchange for respect for the dead and assistance against the undead. As long as you keep your end of the bargain, you live twice as long as you normally would before dying of natural causes. Additionally, the first time each day that you would be reduced to 0 Hit Points and gain the dying condition, you instead regain a number of Hit Points equal to twice your level (starting from 0 HP), remain conscious, and gain fast healing equal to your level for 3 rounds.</p><p>In exchange, you swear to treat the dead you come across with respect, performing last rites and final dispositions to ensure their spirits rest in peace and are less likely to rise as undead. Furthermore, you swear to destroy undead you come across, so long as it's within your power to do so without inordinate risk to yourself. Violating your part of the pact causes its protections to immediately end. If at that point you had already lived beyond your natural lifespan, the psychopomps typically give you a few moments to make any last farewells, and then you simply breathe your final breath and pass on.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pact of Eldritch Eyes] Feat 14</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Pactbinder Dedication</p><hr /><p>You've sworn a pact with an entity beyond mortal comprehension, granting you distant visions and insights. You can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Prying Eye]</em> as an occult innate spell once per hour, using the higher of your class DC and your spell DC to determine the DC.</p><p>In exchange, you allow the entity to peer through you at your world. The entity's touch creates strange dreams, typically nightmares. Every morning, you awaken trained in an unexpected Lore skill determined by the GM, which you retain until the next time you rest for the night. While the entity contacts you most often while you sleep, it occasionally peers at you during the day, leading to disorientation and visions. You can generally determine what's going on during these visions, so normally this occurrence imparts no mechanical penalty. However, in the unlikely event that an encounter begins while you're experiencing visions from the entity, you might take a circumstance penalty to your initiative roll.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> The entity isn't particularly attached to its pact with you. If you want it gone, you can retrain out of Pact of Eldritch Eyes, after which the entity withdraws its eyes to the void.</p>",

If you do something especially strange or dangerous while you're in your Daydream Trance, such as entering a restricted area or fighting someone in the street, any creature that isn't one of your allies must attempt a @Check[type:perception|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] check against your class or spell DC (whichever is higher). On a success, it realizes something is amiss, and on a failure, it believes nothing is out of the ordinary.

If you're legendary in Arcana, Nature, or Occultism, or Religion, whenever a creature that you can observe gains the benefits of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Time Stop]</em> or similar effects, you can observe what happens during the stopped time, though you still can't act yourself for the duration.</p><h2><br />@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Chronomancer's Secrets] Feat 8</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Time Mage Dedication</p><hr /><p>The secrets of time peel back, revealing deeper truths. You gain either the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Stasis]</em> domain spell or the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Path of Least Resistance]</em> focus spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your pool by 1.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> You can take this feat a second time, gaining the focus spell that you didn't gain the first time. Increase the number of Focus Points in your pool by 1.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Future Spell Learning] Feat 8</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Time Mage Dedication</p><hr /><p>More future memories of time magic percolate back to the present, teaching you spells you've yet to learn. Add <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Behold the Weave]</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Cast into Time]</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Haste]</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Loose Time's Arrow]</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Quicken Time]</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Slow]</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Stagnate Time]</em> to your spell list. You can thus potentially learn these spells even if they aren't normally on your tradition's spell list.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.What Could Have Been] Feat 8</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Time Mage Dedication</p><hr /><p>Rather than conjuring creatures from elsewhere in the world or the planes, you can temporarily pull a much different version of yourself from an alternate timeline-for instance, instead of summoning a generic or random troll with <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Summon Giant]</em>, you summon a troll version of yourself from a timeline where you're a troll. If your next action is to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Cast a Spell] that summons a creature, that creature is another version of you. This creature remains the type of creature you summoned and has largely the same abilities (plus the following adjustments), but it clearly resembles you, likely sharing some distinguishing features, such as mannerisms, speech patterns, tattoos, or clothing. The summoned creature gains a +1 status bonus to any skill check in which you're trained, a +2 status bonus if you're an expert, a +3 status bonus if you're a master, or a +4 status bonus if you're legendary. The creature also takes a -2 penalty to all skills in which you're untrained.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Into the Future] Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Time Mage Dedication</p><hr /><p>You know your spell will be needed not now but in a few moments, so you cast your magic into the future. If your next action is to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Cast a Spell] that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast, the spell's effects occur 1 round later, at the beginning of your next turn, rather than immediately. Targets and choices about the spell must be determined when the spell is cast, and requirements, such as line of sight and line of effect, must be valid both when the spell is cast and when its effects occur. Consequences for the action of Casting the Spell itself, such as an Attack of Opportunity reaction or ending a foe's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fascinated] condition by taking a hostile action, aren't delayed.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Purge of Moments] Feat 16</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Time Mage Dedication</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p><hr /><p>All things eventually end, a truth that you can put into practice by accelerating your passage through time to shake off harmful effects. Five rounds of apparent time occur for you. No one, including you, can act during this time, but effects on you run their course, including beneficial effects, negative effects, afflictions, conditions, and persistent damage. Roll saving throws, flat checks, damage, and any other rolls for those effects normally as if the time had passed. Excessive use of this technique is responsible for more than a few premature gray hairs among time mages.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Timeline-Splitting Spell] Feat 18</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Time Mage Dedication</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><hr /><p>You invest in two futures, then choose the one to make a reality. You Cast two Spells that each take 1 or 2 actions to cast. These can't be the same spell heightened to two different levels. You expend the resources for both spells, such as spell slots, Focus Points, and material components. Determine the immediate results for both spells, including attack rolls, saving throws, damage, and any other dice rolls. Then, choose which of the two spells takes effect, using the previously made rolls. The other spell's resources are still expended, but the spell has no effect as the magic disappears the other timeline.</p>",

Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell, your scent extends between worlds, like Carmine Jaws's own. This causes you to be able to smell ethereal creatures, those in an extradimensional space with an aperture that's within your scent range, incorporeal creatures and objects, and other creatures and objects that are insubstantial or not fully in phase with reality. Unlike your normal scent, this is an imprecise sense.</p>",

If you already have the Conceal Spell feat, you can use Conceal Spell once per round as a free action instead of as a single action.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Emancipator's Mask] Feat 20</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication</p><hr /><p>Your mask grants you the abilities of Whistling Kite, the Vigilant Seer, who emancipated thousands. When you are attempting a check to free someone else from an effect that immobilizes, paralyzes, or controls them, roll twice and take the higher result; this is a fortune effect. The GM might decide that this fortune effect applies when attempting checks to remove other conditions or effects to free another. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only one creature, you can choose to permit the target to make an attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape].</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Grand Medic's Mask] Feat 20</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication</p><hr /><p>Your mask is infused with restorative magic associated with Ibex, the Flourishing Field, so it constantly repairs itself. You gain fast healing 5. If you lose a limb or other body part, it regrows within 1 day. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only one creature, you can choose to have the spell also give that creature temporary Hit Points equal to the spell's level until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Protective Spirit Mask] Feat 20</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication</p><hr /><p>Your mask carries the protective instincts of White Bull, the Horn Forger, and no one will hurt your allies while you have anything to say about it. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only one ally, you can choose to have the spell also give that creature a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Item.Effect: Protective Spirit Mask]</p><p>You also gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.Protector's Interdiction] reaction.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Sky Master Mask] Feat 20</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication</p><hr /><p>Your mask holds the legacy of Black Heron, the Wings of Knowledge, who united the aeromancers of the Shory Empire. You can harness residual magical power to fly. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only you, your fly Speed doubles until your next turn.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Stalking Feline Mask] Feat 20</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication</p><hr /><p>Like Azure Leopard, the Patient Warden, your mask makes you most at home in the night and teaches you how to use the darkness to hunt. You gain greater darkvision. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell with the shadow or darkness trait, you can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Hide] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sneak] as a free action. You must still meet the usual requirements of the action you choose, such as having cover or concealment to Hide and being undetected or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] to Sneak.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Storyteller's Mask] Feat 20</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication</p><hr /><p>Your mask remembers the stories of Shifting Frog, Storyteller of the Past and Future. You can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Foresight]</em> once per day as an innate spell, either arcane if you have Wizard Dedication or primal if you have Druid Dedication, but the duration is 10 minutes instead of 1 hour. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only a single foe, you can Recall Knowledge about that foe.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Thick Hide Mask] Feat 20</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication</p><hr /><p>Your mask grants you the toughness of Elephant, the Conjured Chronicle. Increase your maximum number of Hit Points by 20. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only you, you gain resistance 10 to all physical damage until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Tireless Guide's Mask] Feat 20</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication</p><hr /><p>Your mask hosts the legacy of Golden Snake, the Tireless Guide, allowing you to guide others with ease. Your allies can use Follow the Expert to follow you for any of your trained skills, in addition to skills in which you are an expert or better. When they follow you when you use a trained skill, their circumstance bonus is +1. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only one ally, that ally can Stride as a free action.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Vigilant Mask] Feat 20</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication</p><hr /><p>Your mask grants the extraordinary magical senses of Carmine Jaws, the Hyena who Looks Between. You gain scent as a precise sense to a range of 60 feet. If you already have scent as a precise sense, increase its range by 60 feet. You can sometimes catch a faint whiff of magic itself. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell, your scent extends between worlds, like Carmine Jaws's own. This causes you to be able to smell ethereal creatures, those in an extradimensional space with an aperture that's within your scent range, incorporeal creatures and objects, and other creatures and objects that are insubstantial or not fully in phase with reality. Unlike your normal scent, this is an imprecise sense.</p>",

To better study the celestial mantle, these eccentric astronomers broke away from their Sovyrian kin and migrated to the wild continent of Ukulam, where the night skies were clear of light pollution. Though reclusive, Oatia skysages have been known to pass on their esoteric knowledge and unique worldview to similar-minded adventurers. Such adventuring skysages search for secrets and omens in the stars and can even call down stars' light to aid them in battle.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Oatia Skysage Dedication] Feat 2</h2><p>Your study of the stars unlocks supernatural insights and magic.

You gain a spell repertoire with two common cantrips of your choice; these cantrips can be from any spell tradition, but they must be divination spells. You cast these spells as occult spells as you draw on the stars and night sky. You're trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs. If you have a hand free and you've gazed at the night sky in the last 24 hours, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch.

Like your Oatia skysage spells, you cast this focus spell as an occult spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell.

                "content": "<p>As a religious and diplomatic representative of Findeladlara—and all Ilverani of the north—you see it as your duty to befriend shorter-lived peoples you encounter on your travels. Unlike other Ilverani, also called \"snowcaster elves\" by outsiders, you find outsiders interesting and believe there is much to learn from having conversations and relationships with others. Whether to watch them, teach them, or to keep would-be enemies close, you believe a broad smile, ageless learning, and a watchful eye are key. Some see this watchful and outwardly friendly nature as condescending, but they don't understand the reason why worshipers of Findeladlara feel a duty to uphold this tradition. When Earthfall struck and most of the other elves on Golarion fled to Sovyrian or delved deep into the earth, the elves that would one day come to be known as Ilverani remained and sought to shelter others from catastrophe. They built refuges to protect others and helped guide people to safety during the Age of Darkness. While Twilight Seekers today don't build safe structures, they do work to build bonds among people so that society can be protected against other catastrophic events should they come to pass.</p><p>This calling brings you in contact with many different cultures, yet you seek to preserve the ways of your people. To this end, you are ever on your guard against the lure of \"modern fads.\" Unfortunately, some twilight speakers have succumbed to the allure of other ways of life and, for them, there is only one outcome: exile.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Twilight Speaker Dedication] Feat 2</h2><p>You have carefully studied the histories, customs, and etiquette of many of the younger peoples of Golarion. You become an expert in Society. At 7th level, you become a master in Society, and at 15th level, you become legendary in Society. You can use the Society skill instead of the Diplomacy skill when you attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Make an Impression] on a non-elven intelligent humanoid creature.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the Twilight Speaker archetype.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Empathic Envoy] Feat 4</h2><p>You believe that treating others with respect is the fastest way into their hearts, and in turn others are more likely to believe in your good intentions and write off bad first impressions as flukes. If a creature's attitude towards you becomes lower over the course of a social interaction (for example, from friendly to indifferent, or from indifferent to unfriendly), their impression of you returns to its starting level an hour after the social interaction ends. This ability has no effect if the creature you are interacting with becomes hostile.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Disarming Smile] Feat 6</h2><p><strong>Trigger</strong> You are the target of a melee attack and the attacker has not rolled yet.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are aware of the attacker, the attacker is an intelligent humanoid creature, and you have not attempted to harm the attacker.</p><hr /><p>With a wide, sincere smile, you give your attacker pause. You attempt a Diplomacy check against the triggering attacker's Will DC. After you use Disarming Smile, all creatures who witnessed you use it are temporarily immune to your Disarming Smile for the next 24 hours.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Your enemy ceases their attack. The attack fails and the triggering target can't attempt hostile actions against you until the beginning of its next turn or until you (or your allies) take hostile actions against the enemy (or its allies). You can begin talking to the creature on your next turn to attempt another Diplomacy check; on a success, you sustain the effect until the beginning of your next turn, to a maximum of 1 minute. Talking on subsequent rounds requires that you be able to communicate with the target creature and imparts the auditory and linguistic traits to the action.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> Your foe pauses momentarily. Their attack fails, but they can attempt further attacks against you.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> The target's attack is unaffected.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Betraying Shank] Feat 6</h2><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are within melee reach of a target, but it is not in combat with you.</p><hr /><p>While your usual diplomacy is well intentioned, you know that sometimes those same skills will need to be turned to deception. In a flash, you draw a sheathed or concealed agile or finesse weapon and make a melee Strike. The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Flat-Footed] against your Strike. You then roll Deception for initiative.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ilverani Purist] Feat 8</h2><p>All twilight speakers are trained to resist the alluring customs of younger peoples, but you have made it your mandate to keep the Ilverani way unchanged. Such dedication has given you a trained eye for subtlety and deception. When you attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sense Motive]{Sense the Motive} of a non-elf humanoid creature and you roll a critical failure, you fail instead.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.World-Wise Vigilance] Feat 8</h2><p>Your keen study of other cultures gives you insights into the ways those cultures fight. When you use Perception to roll initiative and none of your enemies have the elf trait, you can choose to roll Society instead.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Emphatic Emissary] Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Trigger</strong> You roll initiative.</p><hr /><p>You can tell when diplomacy has failed and a meeting is close to unraveling or falling to blows. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your initiative roll. During your first turn in combat, you can use your Disarming Smile, targeting every hostile intelligent humanoid creature that can see you but has yet to act. If you choose to sustain your Disarming Smile, you sustain the effect for only one creature, as normal.</p>",

The harrower uses the ancient art of fortune-telling to harness destiny and augment their spellcasting abilities, infusing them with power by drawing cards from their harrow deck and letting fate decide what elements of their magic need augmentation. For many years, the traditions of the harrower were limited to regions like Varisia and Ustalav, where the Varisian people had more deeply established traditions.

If your next action is to Cast a Spell, the suit of the card you draw enhances the spell in one of the following ways. If the card you draw matches the suit of your active harrow omen, the effect is enhanced further as detailed below. When you Harrow Cast, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:11]. If you fail this check, you lose your active harrow omen at the end of your turn.</p><p><strong>Hammer</strong> The force of the spell is enhanced. This effect only enhances single-target offensive spells that require you to make a successful spell attack or require a saving throw from the target to resist. If you hit the target, or if they fail their saving throw, the spell inflicts additional force damage equal to the spell's level. This additional damage doubles if your harrow omen is Hammers.</p><p><strong>Key</strong> Some of the magic remains behind, infusing your defenses. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to your AC and all saving throws.

If your harrow omen is Shields, the Hit Points restored increases to 4d6 + twice the spell's level.</p><p><strong>Book</strong> The spell's magic infuses your mind with sudden insights about the target. You can attempt to Recall Knowledge about the target as a free action, using your spell attack roll to make the check. You gain a +2 status bonus to this roll if Books is your harrow omen.</p><p><strong>Star</strong> The spell's magic bolsters those it aids. This effect only enhances single-target spells cast on willing subjects. The magic restores Hit Points to the affected target equal to 2d6 + the spell's level. If your harrow omen is Stars, the magic also grants the target a +2 status bonus to all saving throws until the start of your next turn.</p><p><strong>Crown</strong> The spell's magic is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] and subtle, and observers may not realize you're doing anything more than manipulating cards in your harrow deck. Attempt a Fortune-Telling Lore check against all observer's Perception DCs. If your check is successful against an observer's Perception DC, that observer doesn't notice you are Casting a Spell, even though normally spells have sensory manifestations. This hides only the spell's spellcasting actions and manifestations, not its effects.

The card flies through the air to strike at that target, inflicting 4d6 damage, with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classDC.value)|basic:true] saving throw against your class DC. The type of damage inflicted is determined by your active harrow omen; if the card drawn is in the same suit as your active harrow omen, the target takes a –2 status penalty to its saving throw. The damage increases to 6d6 if you're 10th level and 8d6 if you're 15th level. You can continue to throw cards at targets on your turn as long as you Sustain the Vengeful Spirit Deck—throwing a card takes two actions. This effect lasts as long as you Sustain it, up to 1 minute, or until you no longer have an active harrow omen. Once the effect ends, you lose your active harrow omen.</p><p><strong>Hammers:</strong> [[/r 4d6[cold]]] damage, [[/r 6d6[cold]]], [[/r 8d6[cold]]]</p><p><strong>Keys:</strong> [[/r 4d6[fire]]] damage, [[/r 6d6[fire]]], [[/r 8d6[fire]]]</p><p><strong>Shields:</strong> [[/r 4d6[poison]]] damage, [[/r 6d6[poison]]], [[/r 8d6[poison]]]</p><p><strong>Books:</strong> [[/r 4d6[electricity]]] damage, [[/r 6d6[electricity]]], [[/r 8d6[electricity]]]</p><p><strong>Stars:</strong> [[/r 4d6[mental]]] damage, [[/r 6d6[mental]]], [[/r 8d6[mental]]]</p><p><strong>Crowns:</strong> [[/r 4d6[acid]]] damage, [[/r 6d6[acid]]], [[/r 8d6[acid]]]</p><hr /><p><em>Note: The original text provided by Paizo does not state which type of saving throw to use.</em></p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Reading the Signs] Feat 8</h2><p>You have a knack for drawing the right card, be it from a harrow deck, in a game of cards, or even when drawing from a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Deck of Many Things]. When you're attempting a skill check involving the drawing of cards or resolving the effects of a divination effect (including attempting a saving throw against a hostile divination effect against you), you gain a +2 status bonus to the check. When you draw a card to determine your harrow omen, perform Harrow Casting, cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Harrowing]</em>, or if you activate a magical deck of cards, draw 2 cards, and choose the one you prefer as your actual card drawn. You can even use this ability when drawing from a Deck of Many Things, but only once per deck. The unused card is shuffled back into the stack.</p>",

                "content": "<p>The military history of the dwarves is a story of largely defensive combat and tactics, whether it be as simple as guarding a camp during the Quest for Sky or a protracted siege, such as at the Sky Citadel of Kraggodan. The martial discipline of the stalwart defender arose over the course of centuries to become an iconic dwarven warrior, capable of holding their ground against overwhelming odds and not ceding an inch of stone.</p><p>To be a stalwart defender is to stand with the resilience of a mountain. When danger arrives you face it unflinchingly, allowing your enemy's blows to glance off you like wind whistling past granite. This mindset comes naturally to dwarves, while other ancestries typically need specialized training to attain the determination needed for such a style.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Stalwart Defender Dedication] Feat 2</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in light armor</p><p><strong>Access</strong> You are a dwarf or have undergone defender training in a dwarven settlement such as Highhelm. </p><hr><p>You have completed your initial training in the ways of a stalwart defender. You gain the Tenacious Stance action. </p><hr><p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you take two other feats from the stalwart defender archetype.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Mountain Skin] Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Stalwart Defender Dedication</p><hr><p>You become trained in medium and heavy armor. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in any armor (but not unarmored defense), you also gain that proficiency rank in the armor types granted to you by this feat.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Tunnel Wall] Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Shield Block, Stalwart Defender Dedication</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are in Tenacious Stance.</p><hr><p>Using your shield, you guard against the movement of foes as surely as if you were a wall of stone. You Raise a Shield and become anchored for 1 round. While anchored, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to the DC to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Tumble Through] your space.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Crushing Step] Feat 6</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Stalwart Defender Dedication</p><hr><p>The weight of your armored feet casts aside natural impediments. When wearing medium or heavy armor, you ignore difficult terrain from non-magical sources. If you are a master in the armor you are wearing, you also ignore greater difficult terrain from non-magical sources.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Gravel Guts] Feat 6</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Stalwart Defender Dedication</p><hr><p>Stone never becomes queasy, so why should you? You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against the sickened condition. When you succeed at a Fortitude save to reduce your sickened value, you reduce it by 2 (or by 3 on a critical success).</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Upset Balance] Feat 6</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Stalwart Defender Dedication, expert in Athletics</p><p><strong>Trigger</strong> You are damaged by a melee Strike.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are in Tenacious Stance.</p><hr><p>You lean into your foe's attack, using the weight of your body and armor to send them reeling.

With a heavy impact of your armored heel, you crack the ground underneath you. The ground within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] becomes difficult terrain. If you are a master or better in the armor you are wearing, this becomes greater difficult terrain. The cracked ground settles and reverts to normal terrain after 1 minute.</p><hr><p><strong>Special</strong> At 16th level, you can take this feat again.
