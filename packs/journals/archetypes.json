Or in a pinch, with trebuchets, siege towers, catapults, hwachas, and all other lethal miscellanea of a combat engineers' corp. As a true artillerist, you leave the penny-ante pistols and knives to those who only need to operate on a small scale. You're a consummate professional in the art of big guns, a maestro at merging mathematics and manpower to transform whatever castle wall, infantry battalion, or rampaging dragon offends you into a smoking crater in the ground.</p><p>You're not just some daredevil demolitionist, though. You're part of a team, accustomed to coordinating with your unit to maximize your time and effectiveness. Whether jumping in to help your crew load the next round, quickly calculating the trajectory of the engine's next shot, or taking the shot yourself, your presence on the team ensures their chances of success are maximized, creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p><table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr style=\"text-align:right\"><th>Leading with a Cannon</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>A proper artillerist is more than an engineer, though their skills in that field certainly shouldn't be underestimated. When a war becomes unavoidable, the presence of knights and pikemen might decide a skirmish or battle, but a well-trained artillerist with a reliable squad and a few good siege weapons can make the difference between prolonged months of battle with countless lives lost and a shorter, less bloody affair with fewer deaths and a more lasting victory.</p><p>Castles and fortifications are critical tools for holding land in a world full of empires, kingdoms, and duchies all vying for power. Many wars are won or lost not based on the military might of either side, but on a castle's ability to withstand an extended siege. Without a team of engineers capable of penetrating a castle or keep's defenses, the occupants can wait out an invading force for as long as they have enough food and water to keep their citizens and defenders healthy and fed. Many wars have been \"won\" when the besieged force manages to last through a single winter. Besieging armies whose supply lines break down due to snow-clogged passes or insufficient cold weather gear are forced to retreat due to losses from poor hygiene or hypothermia long before attrition has had an opportunity to impact their opponents.</p><p>An artillerist changes this dynamic, completely rewriting the rules of war. Rather than time being on the side of the besieged, it becomes the tool of the besieger. Each day that passes while a skilled artillerist hammers the castle walls with cannon fire and catapult stones brings the fortifications ever closer to crumbling down. Some wise nobles and warlords who realize their opponents have brought siege weapons, especially powerful black powder siege weapons like cannons, will choose to negotiate surrender before battle is even started, recognizing an inevitable defeat that can be staved off temporarily by sacrificing many soldiers but not thwarted without outside intervention.</p><p>Ruthless or evil artillerists, or the warlords they follow, might take things a step further, specifically targeting granaries to starve enemies out or launching rotting food, corpses, or diseased livestock into parts of the town near water sources. As food and water supplies dwindle, so too does the morale of the castle's inhabitants and defenders. Even a stubborn noble or warlord will find it hard to continue resisting a siege when their own troops mutiny and their citizens begin seeking a way out.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Artillerist Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in martial weapons</p><hr /><p>Artillery is a team sport, where every member of the crew has to rely on the other members.

                "content": "<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\"><li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li></ul><p>The art of creating the weapons most commonly referred to as \"beast guns\" is truly ancient, with the first iterations of the weapons created on the continent of Arcadia well over 10,000 years ago. This means that beast guns predate all other forms of firearm crafting in Arcadia, even the legendary star guns, whose secrets have been lost to the ages. The tradition of designing beast guns has persisted throughout Arcadia well into the modern era, though it has become increasingly rare as the proliferation of classic firearms and the prestige associated with star guns has allowed more people access to equivalent destructive power without the intense requirements behind crafting a beast gun. However, beast gunners remain virtually unknown outside of Arcadia.</p><p>The art of bonding to a beast gun and gaining the full magic of a beast gunner is an extended ritual with multiple steps, beginning with the hunt. A person seeking to bond to a beast gun typically does so with a brand new weapon made after they hunt down the creature themselves. This involves telling the story of the hunt, the beast, and the weapon created from the hunted creature. Finally, the weapon is carefully modified and tailored to ensure a proper bond between the beast gun and the prospective beast gunner. However, it's also possible to bond to an heirloom beast gun passed down through the generations by adding symbolic fresh components from the same kind of creature, after performing the same ritual hunt necessary to forge a new weapon with the intent of establishing a bond.</p><p>To perform the ritual the prospective beast gunner must first plan a hunt to slay the creature corresponding to the beast gun, whether they wish to bond with a brand new beast gun or establish a link to an old beast gun. Typically, these ritualized hunts can include up to five assistants plus hunting beasts like canines or birds who help corner the beast and bring it down. If the assistants are significantly more powerful than the hunted creature, or if there are so many assistants the creature never stood a chance at survival, the magic simply fails during the bonding process and the hunt and organic materials are wasted, usually much to the shame and chagrin of the hunter. The same doesn't apply if the prospective beast gunner hunts the creature alone, even if they are significantly more powerful than the creature, such that the creature never stood a chance against them in a one on one fight.</p><p>You're one of those who successfully completed the hunt and bonded with your prized weapon. Now, you seek to discover the hidden depths that others who think they know how to use beast guns can only imagine.</p><table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr style=\"text-align:right\"><th>Choosing your Beast Gun</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A beast gunner's bond with their beast gun is deep and mystical, so if you hope to be a successful beast gunner, it's important to choose a beast gun that suits your temperament, magic, and combat style. For example, if you favor strength and intimidation, a screech shooter is the right choice for you, whereas a spider gun might be optimal if you prefer a more careful style of setting up the battlefield in advance. Similarly, a tentacle cannon is slow and methodical and can hold an enemy in place at close range, while a drake rifle is energetic and mobile and can be used to attack from a great distance. Each beast gun has a personality and magical abilities that attract people who value them. For this reason, some experienced beast gunners say the weapon chooses you.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Additional Feats:</strong> <strong>8th </strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Call Gun]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Beast Gunner Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert with at least one type of firearm, you own a beast gun and have slain the type of creature associated with your beast gun in a fair hunt (see above); trained in Arcana and Crafting</p><hr /><p>You've bonded to your beast gun and unlocked the first hints of its hidden potential.

You might wear the robes of the deity's order, or you might give little thought and even less reverence to the source of your powers. However you feel about these potent gifts, there can be no doubt that you wield a special power. Benevolent deities are most likely to empower a blessed one. However, any deity can grant such a blessing, as long as they're capable of granting a healing divine font to their clerics. This means such deities as Lamashtu might grant the blessed one's powers for their own purposes. Despite this possibility, it's quite uncommon for deities of cruelty, death, and destruction to grant the power of rejuvenation. When this does occur, the deity usually has a malicious intent behind the gift. Ultimately, you decide how you will use this gift.

You and your mount are an unparalleled team, moving with shared intent to become a powerful force in combat. You might wield a banner in the name of an order of which you're a member, a liege to whom you've sworn your service, or an ideal you uphold. Or you might fight solely to further enrich your own prestige, reputation, and coffers. Traditionally, cavaliers are envisioned riding atop majestic or fearsome horses, but in reality, all kinds of animals can serve this honorable role, from riding dogs to dinosaurs. What's important is not the type of mount but the connection between the cavalier and their companion. This bond is their true strength.</p><table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e remaster\"><thead><tr style=\"text-align:right\"><th>Cavalier Pledges</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Many cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific organization or individual, such as a noble family or sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization, or particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid's animal order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema, you should work with your GM to determine the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge. Cavaliers who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier's Banner. If you violate the anathema of your pledge, you lose access to those feats until you benefit from an <em>atone</em> ritual. Changing the subject of your pledge is equivalent to retraining a class feature.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Cavalier Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Nature or Society</p><hr /><p>You gain a young animal companion that serves as your mount. You can choose from animal companions with the mount special ability, as well as any additional options from your pledge, as determined by your GM. You must choose an animal companion that's at least one size larger than you, but if the animal usually starts as Small, you can begin with a Medium version of that animal (changing no statistics other than its size).</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> If you have pledged yourself to a cause, you can take a second dedication feat closely tied to that cause even if you haven't taken two additional cavalier feats. For instance, if you pledged yourself to fight crime with a group of vigilantes, you could take the vigilante dedication without first completing the cavalier archetype.

By gathering and purifying vast quantities of qi and enriching their bodies' qi with energies from the Universe and Creation's Forge, these warriors pursue—or \"cultivate\"—immortality and gain mastery over life and death. Many cultivators seek to become ageless immortals with awe-inspiring mystical powers known as xian and potentially even ascend to divinity as minor officials of the Tian pantheon. More unorthodox cultivators instead mingle qi with the Void and the Netherworld's dark energies.</p><p>While humanoid cultivators are the norm, it isn't unheard of for animals, trees, rocks, or even household objects to cultivate their qi and become powerful yaoguai. The mountains of Shanguang, Shenmen, and Zi Ha are famed sites for cultivators, as are the bamboo groves of Songbai and the verdant heart of the Valashmai Jungle. All types of cultivators are watched over carefully by Tian Xia's imperial dragons, for cultivators go against Heaven's will in seeking to transcend their ontology and destiny. There is little place for the timid among cultivators, as they seek to stand among the most powerful beings of both earth and Heaven. As a result, their personalities tend to be extreme, possessed of otherworldly benevolence, hellish wrath, or unmoving poise.</p><p>The intense effort and discipline required to reach the peaks of cultivation weed out most aspirants before they can even truly begin, and the tribulations that most cultivators attract winnows the rest. While calamity drives many to cultivate, rumors persist that gods and dragons alike test and punish cultivation's path with yet more hardship and woe.

The awe-inspiring presence of these creatures makes them worthy of reverence-or even outright worship. Dragon disciples dedicate themselves to becoming like these great beasts, with each disciple striving to typify one variety of dragon. Sorcerers of draconic blood, barbarians with the dragon instinct, and many kobolds with close ties to their draconic predecessors become dragon disciples, but anyone who has encountered one of these terrifying creatures might follow this path.</p><p>As a dragon disciple, you study and learn from the example of dragons, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you admire the dragons you emulate. While most dragon disciples do indeed revere their chosen dragon, countless tales are told of dragon disciples born of great personal tragedy at the hands of boundless draconic fury. These disciples have transformed themselves into what they despise in order to gain the power to destroy their draconic tormentor and at long last earn their revenge.</p><table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr style=\"text-align:right\"><th>Instinct of the Wyrm</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>The acquisition of draconic might can change the dragon disciple's body and give them magical abilities, as reflected in the archetype's feats, but the mind often changes as well, potentially even overwhelming the disciple's normal personality. Any dragon disciple can find the attitudes of dragonkind intruding into their thoughts. The foremost emotion among all types of dragons is pride. Even the influence of a benevolent metallic dragon can overwhelm a dragon disciple with pride. When tempered, this feeling levels out to a steady confidence, but when uncontrolled, it can grow to an air of arrogance or superiority.</p><p>Disciples of metallic dragons also feel the pangs of compassion and benevolence. They grow to be more focused on cooperation and might take on leadership roles. Disciples of the vile chromatic dragons are plagued by thoughts of cruelty and greed. They long to see fear in the eyes of foe and friend alike. Those who succumb to these thoughts become bullies or tyrants.</p><p>Instinctual draconic feelings can be constant, yet they seem to intensify when the disciple uses their draconic powers. In the few seconds after using a breath weapon or attacking with claws, or when the disciple sprouts wings, they might have a moment of mental transformation. This can bring on the full mindset of a dragon, or even make the disciple temporarily believe they truly are a dragon, and is often accompanied by a draconic roar, cackle, or majestic display.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Dragon Disciple Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p><strong>Access</strong> You are a kobold with the dragonscaled or spellscaled heritage, a dragon instinct barbarian, or a draconic bloodline sorcerer.</p><hr /><p>You choose to study or worship one type of dragon, and your focus grants you a measure of its power.

Those who gain admission to such training classes might duel in formalized settings—and that's certainly the more genteel route to take. However, others assert that there's no better training ground for duels than the chaotic life of an adventurer. In such situations, a flexible, single‑handed fighting style is invaluable.

You believe that by balancing, mixing, and rearranging these elements, magic is made. This belief has led you to eschew traditional magical theories and divisions, and you instead focus on harnessing, manipulating, and shaping the elements. There are many paths to elementalism, and many classes can become elementalists. As the most basic building blocks of matter, the elements can be shaped to your specific training and understanding. The study of elementalism expands every day.</p><p>You cast spells drawn from multiple traditions and can use the elements to alter and empower your spells, making them manifest and mixing them in unique ways. Most elementalists embrace either the philosophy of four elements common in the Inner Sea or the five-element cycle prevalent in Tian Xia. This is often a balance, but some elementalists feel a stronger connection to a singular element that they hone to great heights, utilizing the other elements to support and augment their favored.</p><h2>Elemental Magic (1st)</h2><p>You're a spellcaster who specializes in harnessing the elements. Though you might feel a kinship for one element over the others, you're capable of shaping many of them. Due to your specialization in elemental magic, you have a smaller, more focused spell list than other spellcasters, though your magic is drawn from multiple traditions. If you choose this class archetype, you must select the Elementalist Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> You must have a spellcasting class feature that chooses spells from the arcane or primal spell list.</p><p><strong>Elementalist Adjustments:</strong> Replace your spell list with the elemental spell list. Your actual magical tradition is unchanged, but you choose your spells from the elemental list instead. You must choose an elemental philosophy (detailed below), which determines which spells and other elemental magic you can use.</p><p><strong>Druid Elementalist Adjustments:</strong> If you're a druid of the storm order and air is in your elemental philosophy, you can choose to replace your starting order spell, tempest surge, with updraft.</p><p><strong>Elemental Sorcerer Adjustments:</strong> If you're a sorcerer with the elemental bloodline, you can replace your initial bloodline spell with an initial elemental focus spell, and your advanced bloodline spell with an advanced elemental focus spell. The initial and advanced elemental focus spells you select must have the same trait as your elemental bloodline.</p><p><strong>Wizard Elementalist Adjustments</strong>: If you're a wizard, you can either choose to be a universalist or to follow an arcane school dedicated to one element from your elemental philosophy. If you choose an elemental school, your curriculum spells can be any spells that you have access to and that have your chosen element's trait.

Your choice of elemental philosophy affects your other spells. Your personal list also contains any spell that shares one or more traits with those in your elemental philosophy, and doesn't have any traits that aren't in your elemental philosophy. For example, an elemental cycle elementalist could choose a spell with both the earth and fire traits, but not one with the air and fire traits, while an inner sea elementalist could choose either of those, but not a spell with metal and fire traits.</p><p>You can't take elementalist feats or use elementalist abilities for an element you're unable to attune to.

They collect spirits expressly for the purposes of offering them comfort, guidance, and absolution. After an exorcist's ministrations, these spirits are freed of their burdens, emotion, and regrets and are reabsorbed into the River of Souls. Although exorcists rarely gather in one place, many different religions employ them to deal with spiritual threats.</p><p>Exorcists are most commonly found among the faithful of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Ashava] the True Spark (the empyreal lord of dancers), but among the major deities of the Inner Sea region, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Sarenrae], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Pharasma], and even @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Shelyn] count a fair number of exorcists among their faithful. Exorcists can come from any walk of life, but many are redeemer champions, clerics, or monks. Apart from the role of the spirit dwelling, exorcism practices can vary. For example, a bard or rogue might attract spirits with trickery, charm, or empty promises. In contrast, a cleric of Pharasma could take a more severe route, demanding the spirits return to the natural order of things.</p><p><strong>Additional Feats:</strong> <strong>8th</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spiritual Sense]; <strong>10th</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Blind-Fight]; 14th Sense Evil; <strong>16th</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Sense the Unseen]</p><table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr style=\"text-align:right\"><th>Spirit Dwellings and Remnants</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>A spirit dwelling can be any object, from an everyday item like a mirror, hand bell, or gemstone, to a custom clockwork device, so long as it can be held in one hand, is light Bulk, and doesn't serve another function (such as a weapon, shield, consumable, or magic item). Your spirit dwelling has the trait of the magical tradition used to take Exorcist Dedication and the necromancy trait. Your spirit dwelling is attuned to you, so only you can use it. If your spirit dwelling is lost or stolen, you can turn another object into a new spirit dwelling with a 1-hour ritual; this causes your previous spirit dwelling to revert to a mundane object and any spirits within to harmlessly disperse.</p><p>Your spirit dwelling can house not just wisps but greater remnants of spiritual energy left behind by defeated ghosts and haunts. You can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Collect Spirit Remnant] activity.</p><p><strong>Rejuvenating Spirits</strong>: Though all spirit wisps and most remnants can pass on immediately when purified, if a spirit remnant came from a creature with the rejuvenation special ability (such as most ghosts), a recurring haunt, or another entity who ordinarily doesn't pass on when destroyed, its ties to this world are too strong for it to easily pass on. When a spirit remnant from such an entity is released as part of your daily preparations, instead of joining the River of Souls, it begins re-forming itself in the time and location noted in its rejuvenation ability. However, you learn a clue about the spirit's unfinished business, which may help you put it to rest permanently.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr style=\"text-align:right\"><th>Exorcists across Golarion</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>The well-known exorcists of Pharasma use methods of repeated prayer, holy water, and sacred rituals. Ashavic exorcists often dance under the moonlight to entice lost souls and guide them onward. In Osirion, exorcists practice execration, or proactive preventive exorcism techniques. In Northern Garund and some parts of Qadira, playing the stringed tanbura, rattling manjur, and specific drum patterns help cut the threads that tie the spirit to this world. Matanji orcs in the Mwangi Expanse perform exorcisms by drawing tattoo-like diagrams in iron ink. In Tian Xia, exorcists often use fulus (Secrets of Magic 158) to assist in their practice.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Exorcist Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Occultism or Religion</p><hr /><p>You've learned to attract, quell, and purify spirits, housing them in a special receptacle called a spirit dwelling until they're ready to move on. Through the power of prayers or ritual incantations, one mundane object in your possession becomes a spirit dwelling (page 23). Your spirit dwelling functions as a lure for lost spirits weakened by their time on the Material Plane. Each day during your daily preparations, your spirit dwelling attracts a spirit wisp who comes to dwell inside. If your spirit dwelling contains no wisps, you can spend 10 minutes in a minor ritual to cast your spirit dwelling around an area and attract another wisp. You can also capture stronger spirit remnants from vanquished undead spirits, as explained in the sidebar on page 23. As long as your spirit dwelling contains any spirits, it glows faintly, casting dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p><p>As an exorcist, you do more than just collect spirits: you also help rid them of their burdens and lingering resentments, aiding their transition from the Material Plane. Every day, before your daily preparations, any spirit wisps and remnants remaining within your spirit dwelling from the previous day are purified and can join the River of Souls in their final journey to Pharasma's Boneyard.</p><p>You can also learn abilities that let you purify a spirit in your spirit dwelling immediately in a cathartic surge, granting you a helpful effect as they depart for the afterlife.

Hoping to produce the next great innovation in fireworks technology, you often send back the notes from your studies and field demonstrations to esteemed colleagues from your fireworks house, seeking their opinions on your next big idea.</p><table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr style=\"text-align:right\"><th>Describing Your Fireworks Display</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>As a firework technician, the exact visuals of your character's special abilities might matter significantly to you. No two firework technicians use exactly the same fireworks display, even if they come from the same fireworks house and both use the same feat to generate the display. In fact, it's likely that when you use a feat from the firework technician archetype, the resulting display remains a bit different each time as you tinker, perfect, and refine your technique. Even so, you probably have a few themes that you prefer for each of your firework technician feats. For instance, your Coughing Dragon Display might appear in the sinuous serpentine shape of a literal imperial dragon, coughing out glittering trails. It might also resemble a simple series of geometric shapes, an enigmatic spiraling aeon trailing off in a shape with radial symmetry, a pattern shaped like a tree blossoming with flowers in the sky, or anything else you can imagine. To help your fellow players visualize what your character is doing, you might come up with some go-to descriptions or draw art depicting some of your favorite displays.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Firework Technician Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Crafting</p><hr /><p>You've learned the secrets of making fire and sound bloom using black powder, metals, and paper. You most likely came by this knowledge through formal training with a fireworks house in Tian Xia or a fireworks company from Vudra, though perhaps you mastered fireworks completely by yourself after finding a secret stash in an old shipwreck.</p><p>You become trained in Fireworks Lore or become an expert if you were already trained in it. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Alchemical Crafting] feat, a pool of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Infused Reagents] equal to your level, and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Advanced Alchemy] (allowing you to make alchemical items during your daily preparations without the normal cost or time expenditure). You can use your infused reagents only to make fireworks, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Launch Fireworks Display], and use other feats from this archetype. Your advanced alchemy level is 1. If you gain infused reagents from more than one source, you use the highest number of reagents to determine your pool rather than adding them together.</p><p>You can also create special fireworks displays using your infused reagents, designed to create distinctive effects you can use to make onlookers marvel and even to gain an advantage in combat. You gain the Launch Fireworks Display action and learn some basic displays, and you can learn additional, more complex displays through other firework technician feats.

Your soul carries on, but your body is gone. Your mind, too, may have changed: though death can impact thoughts and desires in all sorts of ways, most ghosts experience stronger, more volatile emotions and are frequently overcome by their past ties. A need to reconcile the past overwhelms other needs. Motivations can change over time but are always strong. Pragmatism, compassion, and foresight fall before a ghost's fundamental desires.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ghost Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> You died and returned as a ghost.</p><hr /><p>You have risen as a shell of your former self, a spirit of mist and anguish. You gain the ghost, spirit, and undead traits, and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.Basic Undead Benefits]. Your undead craving is to settle your unfinished business. You also gain the incorporeal trait, as described on page 218, except you can't pass through solid objects unless you select the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pass Through] feat. Being a ghost has the following major effects.</p><p><strong>Floating</strong> You can float but are still tethered to the ground. Replace your land Speed with an equal fly Speed. You can't rise more than a few inches above the ground when you Fly. This means you can move above many types of difficult or hazardous terrain without moving slowly or being damaged, even though you can't fly without limit. You can Leap, High Jump, Long Jump, and take similar actions, and use your fly Speed for any calculations that would normally require your land Speed.</p><p><strong>Items</strong> You can transmute physical items to make them part of your incorporeal form. This requires spending 10 minutes with the items within reach, during which you transform the items into part of your form; you can return items you already have incorporated to a corporeal state at the same time. The items retain all their runes and other abilities, need to be invested normally if they have the invested trait, and need to be worn, held, or stowed appropriately. Once you've incorporated the items, you and other incorporeal creatures can use them normally—you can Interact with them, Release them, and so on. Your incorporated weapons gain the benefits of the ghost touch property rune, allowing you to use them normally against both corporeal and incorporeal creatures. Incorporated items become corporeal again only if you transmute them back or are destroyed, in which case, they drop to the ground under you.</p><p><strong>Attacks</strong> Your unarmed attacks become magical and deal void damage instead of their normal type.</p><p><strong>Strength</strong> Unlike most incorporeal creatures, your Strength modifier is not -5; you keep the same Strength attribute you had before you became a ghost, though you can only attempt Strength-based skill checks—typically Athletics checks—against other incorporeal creatures, as normal for an incorporeal creature. Against incorporeal creatures, use your Strength normally to determine the results of Athletics checks, Strikes with melee weapons, and any other checks or damage rolls dependent on Strength.</p><p><strong>Ties that Bind</strong> When you become a ghost, work with your GM to choose a bound site and unfinished business, both of which matter for your character's story, as well as some ghost archetype feats. Your bound site tethers you to the physical world and is typically either a location important to you in life or the place where you died. Unfinished business keeps you from passing to the afterlife. If someone resolves your unfinished business, you decide whether to accept the change and pass on, or to fight it. If you pass on, you get a few minutes to say your goodbyes, and then move into the River of Souls and the afterlife. Your character ceases to be. If you fight the change, you remain, though you and the GM might determine a new unfinished business. If you are physically destroyed, you cease your existence as a ghost but still might not be able to pass on to the afterlife if your unfinished business is incomplete. In this liminal state, you might come across strange energies and become another sort of creature, or anchor to a summoner and become an eidolon.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Frightful Moan] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.xUaEpnfd1FMGNG1z inline hr=false]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ghostly Resistance] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.pwM4RGwCTLiVSic0 inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ghostly Grasp] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ozm0xy2lrOq6GiWU inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ghost Flight] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.zJXsGF61lH0WHw5v inline hr=false]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pass Through] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 10</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.7fyWKASX6uNByJF5 inline hr=false]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Rejuvenation] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.AtidbY3lU49taaUR inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Unlimited Ghost Flight] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 14</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.LhqWrgeBH2sdRxND inline]</p>",

The moment you become a ghoul, your existence focuses upon satisfying this endless craving. Ghouls who go more than a few days without feeding on freshly dead humanoid flesh find themselves in constant pain; those who go for more than a week might be driven to the edge of delirium, becoming bestial in their craving.</p><p>When you succumb to ghoul fever and become a ghoul, you don't lose your mind or memories. You keep your personality only to have it warped by the never-ending need to consume flesh. A brave warrior remains brave, but under the curse of the fever, that brave warrior's prime directive is to consume flesh. A rogue might go from finding clever ways to pick pockets to finding ways to waylay opponents and devour them.</p><p>Since most societies don't allow cannibalism, ghouls who wish to continue their old lives must satisfy their cravings in secret, finding a way to balance society's rules while feeding the constant gnawing hunger inside them. Some take up professions that allow them to secretly eat dead flesh or create dead bodies to feed upon. There are tales told of ghoul mercenary troops who satisfy their cravings and profit, while ghoul spellcasters can use their magic to procure and preserve flesh.</p><p>Ghouls who won't restrain themselves with rules of the living may join or establish ghoul societies.

In addition to the personality changes, your body changes as well. Your ears become pointed, and your skin grows blueish and pale. Your fingernails sharpen into claws; your teeth become razor sharp, ready to tear flesh off the bone; and your tongue grows long and pointed.</p><p>You gain the ghoul and undead traits and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.Basic Undead Benefits]. Your undead craving is for the flesh of dead creatures; freshly dead corpses from sapient creatures fulfill your cravings much more than non-sapient or rotted corpses, but any dead creature can stave off the hunger for at least a little while.

The first unarmed attack is a claw that deals 1d4 slashing damage with the agile and finesse traits, and the second unarmed attack is a set of jaws that deal 1d6 piercing damage and have the finesse trait.</p><p>You gain the Consume Flesh action (see below). Satisfying your craving is difficult. Consuming Flesh temporarily satiates you. Many ghoul feats have extra abilities or functions that can be used when you are satiated, though using those abilities also causes you to lose your satiated status.

Though the Magaambya seeks to hold true to Jatembe's teachings by aiming to understand magic of all kinds, the mages of the Magaambya have found the most success with magic rooted in the material world. Halcyon speakers are powerful conversants who epitomize the Magaambyan practice of blending arcane and primal magic, seeing both traditions as flowing from the same wellspring.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Halcyon Spells</h2><p>Through hard study, Magaambyans can meld arcane and primal spellcasting. Halcyon spells are spells from the arcane or primal spell list. You don't gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell ranks of halcyon spells only through feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your class; for example, a wizard who gained halcyon spells would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire. If you have more than one arcane or primal spellcasting class, you add halcyon spells to all such classes.</p><p>Each time you cast a halcyon spell, decide whether it is an arcane or primal spell. You can't heighten a halcyon spell beyond your maximum spell rank of halcyon spell, even if you have higher-rank spell slots, and you can't select a halcyon spell as a signature spell.</p><p>Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, and each time you gain a halcyon feat, you can swap out one of your old halcyon spells for a different halcyon spell of the same rank; this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as via a sorcerer's spell repertoire class feature. You can also swap out halcyon spells by retraining during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a halcyon spell, you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Halcyon Speaker Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, member of the Magaambya of conversant rank</p><hr /><p>You devote much of your study to halcyon magic. You gain access to two common Halcyon cantrips and two common 1st-rank halcyon spells. In addition to being able to cast your halcyon spells via your arcane or primal spell slots, you also gain a 1st-rank halcyon spell slot. You can use your halcyon spell slots to spontaneously cast your halcyon spells.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Dualistic Synergy] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.9EqUTnbV8WHE2aKm inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Persistent Creation] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.L9aBLPG2veBkVow9 inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Halcyon Spellcasting Initiate] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 10</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.HgBksiMTUibPK36M inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Shared Synergy] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 10</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.8NQaqtHheeMUNGYr inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Charged Creation] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.ADVrDjp75fr2BYMa inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Flexible Halcyon Spellcasting] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.UqA9GdO2pGQwg9cd inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Halcyon Spellcasting Adept] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 14</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.LDv6RVuDXJ9nOfhj inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Fulminating Synergy] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 16</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.XpZkzUV9PwUHvmyq inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Halcyon Spellcasting Sage] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 18</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.iuLLw1X5RjRcR4rH inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Synergistic Spell] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 20</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.WAWaew53zpTFVwQM inline]</p>",

Many tap into these powers with no consideration of the morality of their use. For these unscrupulous magic users, it's simply another avenue in their never-ending pursuit of power, and the abilities learned are turned to the caster's personal ends, whatever they may be.</p><p>Others choose a different path. Through spiritual study and introspection, they have come to recognize the evil intrinsic in the existence of undead, the fundamental wrongness of using the universal energy of death to create an appearance of life. To combat this evil, these casters learn to conduct vitality energy and direct it to great effect against the undead they encounter. They may also engage in ongoing study to learn of the nature of life, death, and undeath, and the precise relationship between each state. These scholars and mages are commonly known as hallowed necromancers-a slightly misrepresentative name, as many of them don't use religious methods, but a frequently used shorthand regardless.</p><p>The exact origin of hallowed necromancers' abilities may vary from one to the next. Some are granted their gifts directly by a sympathetic deity such as Sarenrae or Pharasma, while others might use their knowledge of religion and the planes to learn such abilities on their own. Though rarer, it's even possible these practitioners might discover they possess an intuitive understanding and control over abilities that manifest spontaneously as their capabilities grow. Despite this variance, all share a fundamental understanding that undeath is an aberration to be quickly remedied.</p><p>Though the majority of hallowed necromancers have similar goals and are willing to work together, they tend not to form their own organizations. More often, these necromancers attach themselves to existing groups-such as the Knights of Lastwall or Voices of the Spire-and use their powers in support of those groups' causes. Otherwise, they plan and carry out their own personal vendettas against the forces of undeath, often enlisting the help of trusted friends and allies.</p><table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr style=\"text-align:right\"><th>Hallowed Necromancy in Geb</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>As hallowed necromancy lacks any unified credo, its practitioners are found throughout Golarion. It's rare they make their presence known within the borders of Geb, however. Those who hide their profession usually move on to other lands and those who openly crusade against Geb's many undead quickly find themselves utterly overwhelmed.</p><p>Hallowed necromancers captured in Geb might be executed only to be risen by their foes with their spellcasting ability intact but moral code absent or twisted.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Hallowed Necromancer Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> good alignment, able to cast spells using spell slots, able to cast at least one necromancy spell, expert in Religion</p><hr /><p>You've studied techniques allowing you to blend so-called hallowed necromancy into your own spellcasting to bolster the living and destroy the undead. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Hallowed Ground] focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Refocus] activity. You can Refocus by meditating or praying to connect yourself to conduits of vitality energy. Focus spells from the hallowed necromancer archetype have the same tradition as your spell slots. Casting spells that create, heal, or otherwise aid or promote undead is anathema to you, as is cooperation with undead. Using void energy isn't anathema, as it serves a natural purpose, but twisting that void energy for creation is blasphemous to you.

Some liches prefer to secure their soul cage through obscurity rather than force, enshrouding it in magical abjurations or illusions to hide it from prying eyes. The most gifted crafters among liches tinker and improve their soul cage over time, rendering it nigh indestructible. This is a dangerous proposition, undertaken by only the most confident and arrogant magical engineers, as physically altering one's soul cage could have unintended consequences on its function.

Halcyon spells are spells from the arcane or primal spell list. You don't gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell ranks of halcyon spells only through feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your class; for example, a wizard who gained halcyon spells would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire. If you have more than one arcane or primal spellcasting class, you add halcyon spells to all such classes.</p><p>Each time you cast a halcyon spell, decide whether it is an arcane or primal spell.

Marshals can come from any class or background, though they all share a willingness to sacrifice their own glory for the greater good of the team. Some marshals lead from the front, sword and shield raised, while others may call instructions and encouragements from the rear while providing allied spellcasters with skilled support. Regardless of their preferred method of combat, marshals' ability to bring the best out in every ally is a valuable addition to any group. Though not every marshal is seen by their allies as a source of encouragement. Such marshals strike fear both in enemies and allies alike to inspire competence in battle and ensure that cowardice will not be tolerated. Such tactics are often seen as more practical than cruel, and the results speak for themselves. Quick action and the necessity to fight drive these leaders and their allies forward into the fray of battle. Regardless of what kind of marshal you wish to become, you will lead your allies to glory and victory.</p><p>While many see marshals as traditionally warriors of martial prowess, anyone could make for a potent marshal. Not every such leader charges into the thick of battle. While doing so may inspire bravery in desperate times, many leaders lead from the safety of the back lines. Spellcaster marshals often lead in this manner. In their mind, the practicality of their own survival outweighs the powerful yet fleeting courage a charge inspires. After all, more battles await in the future, and their skills may very well be needed again.</p><p><strong>Additional Feats:</strong> <strong>8th</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Reactive Strike]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Marshal Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in martial weapons and either Diplomacy or Intimidation</p><hr /><p>You've combined your social skills and combat training to become a talented combat leader.

Whenever there's a threat or opening, you're the first to point it out, and you're ready to help your allies directly when necessary.</p><p>.As a group's overwatch, you might let the position go to your head. In such cases, you might think of yourself as the mastermind behind the chessboard and feel detached from your allies, thinking of them as little more than pawns on the field.</p><p>But more likely your role allows you to feel a deeper connection to your allies, and your coordination and heroics stand out most when you subsume your individual ego to serve the group's needs. In that case, you might think of yourself as a part of a functional whole—if your party was a single living body, you serve as the eyes, but that doesn't mean you're the brain, the heart, or other vital organs.

A keen and incisive perception is necessary, of course, but that alone won't be sufficient. While many a ranger or rogue must sharpen their senses or face a short career, a true overwatch must be able to apply information received from all five senses (and any additional special senses they might have) to make split-second decisions that work toward achieving a tactical goal. Such a response can partially be trained through hours of daily drills designed to help a potential overwatch separate true threats and situations requiring their skills from false positives, and even situations where they would cause a problem if they didn't hold back. However, while training helps ingrain good practice into one's reflexes and muscle memory, ultimately, an overwatch candidate who lacks an innate degree of good tactical instinct will find such training slow to produce results, or in the worst case, even impossible.</p><p>Beyond senses and instinct, the role of overwatch requires the ability to innovate your enhanced visual gear to assist in removing blind spots and seeing what others miss. This is essential, since you must keep track of your team and nearby foes. While it isn't explicitly necessary for you to be the one with enough skill in Crafting to maintain and upgrade your enhanced visual gear, many successful overwatches choose to do so in order to better understand how every piece works together to create the whole.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Overwatch Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Perception</p><hr /><p>You have an innate knack for tactical observation, and you've innovated to apply that knack in a variety of ways that allow you to assist your allies.

The initiate's mind slowly fills with ancient pieces of lore and techniques that are as much part of the saumen kar as their hands and feet.

Befriending a saumen kar can be enough to begin one's initiation into the pact, though they must choose to accept the burden and can change their minds about undertaking the pact at any point until their final transition (represented by the Bound in Ice feat). Once a creature has completed the pact by accepting the full burden of a saumen kar and taking the Bound in Ice feat, all transformations are permanent. At that point, they can't retrain the Pactbound Dedication, Frostbite Runes, or Bound in Ice feats and must live out the rest of their lives as something between their old ancestry and a saumen kar.

You might wield a single pistol, a pair of pistols, or a pistol paired with a melee weapon to pull off showy maneuvers. However you slice it, though, the use of pistols or other one-handed firearms is crucial to your technique and style.</p><p>To you, everything is a show, and you use your gun as a prop and instrument, not just to kill opponents but to trick, mislead, hinder, and even bully them into doing what you want them to do. While others tend to focus on delivering as much devastation downrange as possible, your style is all about control. By controlling a foe's attention and actions, you can bolster your own attacks and mitigate the foe's potential for mayhem. You control the tempo of the battle much as you would a staged performance, carefully ensuring your foe's actions don't fall outside of your intended script. You're both the director and the star of this show, and your enemies dance to the tune you play with your pistol... sometimes quite literally!</p><table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr style=\"text-align:right\"><th>What Makes a Phenom?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Many gunslingers can learn how to twirl a pistol or intimidate a foe, but it's not just your skills that make you a phenom, it's your style and attitude. As a pistol phenom, you understand how to grab everyone's attention with everything you do, especially the way you talk, the way you walk, and the way you use your gun. But what's more, you're well aware of that fact and the power you have over others, and you aren't afraid to flaunt it.</p><p>Despite this attitude, or perhaps because of it, as a pistol phenom you likely tend to get along well with groups of allies, understanding both how to take the spotlight to protect your allies and how to share it to make sure they get their time in the sun. The one exception to this can be other pistol phenoms. When two or more pistol phenoms gather in the same group, it's almost inevitable for a duel or other contest to arise. However, such a contest need not end in enmity. Depending on your temperament, and that of the other pistol phenom, the result of the exhilarating rivalry expressed during competition could be a lifelong friendship, albeit one in which you both keep score of your greatest achievements to compare exploits.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Pistol Phenom Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in at least one type of one-handed firearm, trained in Deception, trained in Performance</p><hr /><p>You catch an opponent off-guard by spinning your weapon.

Judged souls proceed to their assigned planes, becoming petitioners. These, too, die in time, becoming absorbed by and expanding their associated plane, as their own spiritual essence joins with the plane's as a substance known as quintessence.

When you manifest the essence form, choose one damage type: acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic, spirit, vitality, or void. Attacks with the weapon deal this type of damage instead of their physical damage with a +2 status bonus to the damage. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> When you deal damage with a weapon or unarmed attack, you take 2 damage of the last type you chose for planar pain, even if the damage type normally wouldn't harm you, such as good damage if you aren't evil.</p><p><strong>Pull of Stasis</strong> (transmutation) Weapon only. Any time you hit with the soulforged weapon, the target takes a -10-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. On a critical hit, the creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] for 1 round instead. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> You take a -10-foot penalty to all your Speeds.</p><p><strong>Reflecting Spirit</strong> Armor or shield only.

In such meetings, a different kind of magic may strike: the spark of innovation! The mixing of magical techniques produces fascinating and unpredictable results. As one of these innovators, sometimes called a spell trickster, you have a knack for pioneering magical techniques and discovering new effects from spells most novice spellcasters take for granted. Whether your unique abilities are the result of weeks of experimentation or a secret passed to you by a traveling practitioner, you delight in surprising others with your tricks.</p><table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr style=\"text-align:right\"><th>The Fruits of Research</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>While magic can spring from many sources, from wizard tutors to self-taught savants, the art of the spell trickster often springs from sophisticated magical research. The magical academies in Golarion have no claim to magic as a whole but can often teach lesser-known variants of a spell to their students. At the Magaambya academy in the Mwangi Expanse, for instance, initiates study multiple traditions of magic, adapting the techniques of harnessing magical essence from one tradition to create new methods of casting spells in another. The Arclords of Nex have spent thousands of years honing spells in both wartime and peace, demonstrating a fine control over the arcane by effortlessly changing their magic to suit their whims. The return of New Thassilon brought thousands of magical dabblers and scholars, each with their own unique tricks and each eager to see what new spell variants have developed in their long absence.</p><p>This isn't to say that spell tricksters come solely from high academia. A sorcerer might demonstrate aberrant powers in her bloodline magic, hinting at a background more complex than a single eldritch influence acting upon her. An oracle might grope at a divine power that they poorly understand and cast a spell in a unique manner simply because they were never taught otherwise. A witch's patron or a whimsical deity might grant a favored servant a special power for whatever strange motives such beings might possess. Magic in Golarion isn't entirely predictable, no matter how many practitioners wish that it was so. While most spellcasters follow predictable patterns in their art, there are always exceptions.</p><p>The rules in this section are presented as part of an archetype, meant for a character dedicated to the art of innovating magic—but you don't have to limit yourself to this premise. At the GM's discretion, a spell trickster feat could be made available to a character as a class feat without the character taking the archetype. In most cases, this option should only be offered as a reward or story element that the character, GM, or group has dedicated a significant amount of time to developing—a character who wishes to partake in these options without GM permission or involvement should simply take the spell trickster archetype. These feats could be used to represent the payoff from extended magical research; finding forgotten or forbidden lore in a lost corner of Golarion; pleasing a god, patron, or other notable power; a magical plane or artifact exerting its influence; or any other number of situations that an adventurer might encounter while exploring. Keep in mind, however, that these feats were created and balanced to be part of an archetype. If allowing spell trickster feats as general class feats begins to negatively impact the game, the players should be willing to walk the decision back and rebuild characters as necessary.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spell Trickster Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Able to cast spells; trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion</p><hr /><p>Your experience with magic and its traditions lets you specialize in the casting of certain spells, customizing familiar spells to create novel effects.

They come from a tradition of ancient secrets and principles, which they temper with modern innovation and perspective. Spellshots combine magical power into the art of gunplay to create a distinct and mystical way known only to spellshots, enigmatic and unavailable to other gunslingers in the world at large. The first to identify themselves as spellshots tied their magical traditions to the history of the Star Code and the Crowned Regents in Arcadia. Ancient, reclusive crafters known as the Crowned Regents created star guns, the legendary magical firearms that shot white-hot blasts of energy. Wielders of star guns became bound together by the Star Code—a set of cultural expectations that defined how one should behave while using these powerful weapons. You can find more information about star guns, the Crowned Regents, and the Star Code in Guns &amp; Gears.</p><p>Most spellshots continue to come from Arcadia, as the stories describing the relevant skills and training to become one have been passed down over the generations. Many gunslingers who grow up in this region hear of these tales early in their lives, and they develop the techniques to channel magical energy through their firearms in imitation of the Regents' arcane methods. While Arcadia is home to the vast majority of the world's spellshots, the techniques have slowly spread to other regions. However, spellshots remain particularly rare in the Inner Sea region due to the unique history of guns there and their connection to the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, which exists in a magic-dead region of the Mana Wastes.</p><p><strong>Additional Feats: 4th</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Basic Arcana], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Basic Wizard Spellcasting]; <strong>6th</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Advanced Arcana] <strong>8th:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Arcane Breadth]; <strong>12th:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Expert Wizard Spellcasting]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Spellshot Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Way of the Spellshot]</p><hr /><p>You cast arcane spells like a wizard, gaining a spellbook with four common arcane cantrips of your choice.

When a grave threat arises, a zodiac constellation might shine on an everyday student or worker, granting them the power to transform into a powerful alter ego to repel those threats. Though most of these starlit sentinels act covertly when the world is asleep, some become well known either as urban legends or outright celebrities, though usually only as their alter ego. Some might find themselves pulled between the dual pressures of an unassuming civilian identity working in a market by day, and the defender of that same market from rampaging oni or qi-stealing jiang-shi under the light of the stars. Due to a quartet of well-known female sentinels operating out of Goka, many have come to believe that the zodiac chooses only girls as its champions, but the heavens care little for such mortal concerns and are equally likely to grant their power to those of any gender. Starlit sentinels are rare, even in Tian Xia, and individual sentinels are unique; a new sentinel empowered by a given constellation won't awaken as long as the previous sentinel of that constellation is active.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Starlit Sentinel Dedication]<span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p>You've been chosen by one of the constellations of the Tian Xia zodiac.

The sterling dynamo prosthetic technology presented here was created through collaboration between a Dongun Hold prosthesis inventor, who created the flexible silvery clockwork joint system, and a researcher from the Clockwork Cathedral in Absalom, who created a prototype variant that increased how customizable the model was and sent it back to the dwarven inventor to iterate further.

While your sterling dynamo prosthetic can replace a missing prehensile limb, such as an arm, choosing to add a new limb can never increases your character's number of hands or prehensile limbs beyond two, even in combination with other abilities or effects.</p><p>Your sterling dynamo prosthesis is especially optimized for combat, granting you a dynamo melee unarmed attack that is in the brawling weapon group and is made of silver (which makes it more effective against certain types of creatures, such as devils and werewolves).</p><p>You have several options to customize your sterling dynamo. First, choose whether you have a power driver dynamo, which deals @Damage[1d6[bludgeoning]] damage and has the shove trait, or a percussive striker dynamo, which deals @Damage[1d4[bludgeoning]] damage and has the agile and finesse traits. Most dynamos are automated, so they don't require a free hand to use, like other unarmed attacks. However, you can instead choose to make your dynamo be manually controlled via a handheld switch, lever, or other device; to make an attack with a manually controlled dynamo, you must have a hand free to operate it, but the benefit is great control and a more devastating strike. This increases the damage die by one size, to a 1d8 for a power drive dynamo or 1d6 for a percussive striker dynamo. Arm dynamos are always manual, but they use the hand on that arm to operate the dynamo when making strikes. Manual control is required only in the heat of combat, not for less strenuous adventuring or everyday activities.</p><p>You need to keep your sterling dynamo wound, but the process isn't particularly onerous, so in most situations, it won't be an issue. If you spend 1 minute winding up your dynamo, it can remain active for 24 hours before needing additional winding. However, enemies can attempt to Disable the dynamo, which has a level equal to your own, to reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour, or 2 hours on a critical success. Certain other abilities that adversely affect technology might also reduce the dynamo's remaining operational time. When your dynamo is out of operational time, you can still use it as a normal prosthetic, but you cannot use your dynamo unarmed attack or any other abilities from this archetype until you wind the dynamo again. You can wind the dynamo for 1 minute at any time to return it to the maximum 24 hours of operational time.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Modular Dynamo] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.sVEF7j9Wh1KNGPUm inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Piston Punch] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.0SbHdwYumvmzwWw3 inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Stasian Smash] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.A0keRhzNlcB1u4gD inline hr=false]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Beast Dynamo Howl] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 10</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.K0x90HNHi5hONdDl inline hr=false]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Golem Dynamo] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.xzesXSIXTqsVxm1e inline hr=false]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Soaring Dynamo] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 18</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fyJ2slL98hnQH3On inline]</p>",

This all hinges on the small magical talismans you affix to your gear. You know how to make and use the perfect talisman for any job. The utility of talismans seems endless.

This all excites you, but no more than exploring just how far you can push your talent. What are the true limits of these baubles? You've heard rumors and tales of great dabblers like yourself mastering the art of creating and affixing fantastical magical memorabilia. Some say that these great sages have found a way to affix multiple talismans to a single object, circumventing the most fundamental limitation of the art.

Your secret identity lets you adventure and carry out clandestine missions while keeping the civilians you care about safe. Whatever your purpose—fighting crime, inciting rebellion, sowing chaos—your vigilante identity makes you both hard to pin down and a mysterious, intriguing subject of gossip. While many adventurers prefer to bask in the glory or infamy of their actions, you keep that part of your life a secret. There are various reasons why you might do this. Perhaps you have something or someone in your life that you want to protect from the dangers and threats that your other life. Perhaps you are a public figure, and your alternate life could draw undue attention from your community. It could also be that you don't like attention and wish to retain the ability to step away from it all and relax in peace. Regardless of your reasons, you have a secret identity and will go to great lengths to keep it secret. Vigilantes can have many goals and agendas. Some see them as glory seekers, but more often than not, they are working towards some lofty goal. Perhaps they are trying to inspire a people to fight back against their oppressors. They could be hunting down a crime lord they have a personal vendetta against. Maybe they seek to rebalance the wealth of a nation, stealing from the rich to give to those in need. You are one such vigilante, living a hidden life so you can fight in secrecy. What will you do to keep your secret and continue down your path?</p><p><strong>Additional Feats:</strong> <strong>4th</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Quick Draw]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Vigilante Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Deception</p><hr /><p>You have two identities, each with its own name and abilities. Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these people. If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they must use a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] action to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC, as if you were using the Impersonate action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC. Unlike with Impersonate, you don't have to attempt a Deception check to interact with someone to conceal your other identity—a check happens only if someone else specifically tries to uncover your other identity.</p><p>Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup, along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don't reduce the time required to change identities.</p><p>Your two identities are completely distinct. Checks to Recall Knowledge about one of your identities don't reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the check knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn't exist.</p><p>To maintain the separation between your identities, some of your abilities have the vigilante trait. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity may risk exposing you as a vigilante. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can spend 1 week of downtime to create a new social identity.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Hidden Magic] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.K3Au5071pfvNwGob inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Minion Guise] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.rAbfuZ1mc3lUYH41 inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Safe House] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.vKzAIJuyr9SU2JzU inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Social Purview] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.rNPeOwFZE5Ma18JJ inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Startling Appearance (Vigilante)]{Startling Appearance} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.qg8TlLJRgvjzW9YK inline hr=false]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Quick Change] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 7</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.v1PtAazmEFhTp6fZ inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Subjective Truth] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 7</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.oXoQ9wwOmDe0hwbU inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Many Guises (Vigilante)] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.jZalt2bFGjK8XXcP inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Frightening Appearance] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ano4tRq88V39eyPq inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.It Was Me All Along!] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 14</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.hPfqQpiq6W8RPCxz inline hr=false]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Stunning Appearance] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 16</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Startling Appearance</p><hr /><p>Your sudden appearance leaves your foe unable to respond.

Becoming a living mummy - one capable of both motion and thought - is another thing altogether.</p><p>Most of those forced into undeath as mummies are bound to tombs, temples, and vaults as guardians. Some willingly undergo the process, embracing death to live beyond it. These willing mummies become the most powerful of their kind, rising above their brethren like an emperor above their subjects.</p><p>The horrifically painful living mummification process must be performed by others - usually a team of well-trained necromancers, priests, or ritualists - upon a still-living subject. Death by mummification is gruesome, but to be kept alive for as long as possible throughout the process is a thousandfold worse. The process usually takes weeks, beginning with forced starvation, followed by the consumption of spices and tonics that desiccate the subject's internal organs.</p><p>Very rarely, mummies are created by natural processes occurring in locations that are cursed or inundated by void energy. These mummies most often rise in deserts, bogs, swamps, at high altitudes, or in frigid locales. Although the process through which they are created is less painful and far shorter in duration, the spiritual shift from living to undead is no less traumatizing.</p><p>Mummies are most commonly found in Geb and Osirion, as well as the surrounding nations of Thuvia, Katapesh, and Qadira.

Of course, crafting the shell of a wind-up zombie is one matter—your primary focus is on the craftwork necessary to make the whole thing work together. To you, the magic involved is only a means to an end, a way to make science more efficient through necromancy and potentially a little bit of evocation for some electric power.</p><p>While some think your creations are vile, you see beauty in utility and believe animated corpses are tools that can be used for good or ill. For better or worse, when it comes to results, the science you've cobbled together fulfills the most important criterium for any new innovation: it works, plain and simple. Your reanimated clockwork corpses are stable, effective, and, more importantly, they don't rampage or crave the flesh of the living in the same way an undead would. Plus, they aren't vulnerable to vitality energy, making them easier to use around good clerics and their ilk without your minions taking friendly fire.

Some gain this power through magical training from an ancestor or mentor, while others earn it as a gift or reward from some greater being, or by inexplicable chance. Whatever the source, you have mastered the ability to form a mental image into a corporeal figment solid enough to affect the physical world. You trained the power to aid you in battle by shaping itself into a potent weapon, bound by only the reaches of your own imagination.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Mind Smith Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p>You've learned to imagine a shape in your mind, to envision it so strongly it takes form in the material world. You gain a single melee weapon of your choosing, called a mind weapon. Your mind weapon is a martial melee weapon. The overall shape and design of your mind weapon can be of your choosing but it has one of the following four basic statistics:</p><ul><li>A one-handed weapon that deals 1d4 damage and has the agile and finesse traits</li><li>A one-handed weapon that deals 1d6 damage and has the finesse trait</li><li>A one-handed weapon that deals d8 damage</li><li>A two-handed weapon that deals 1d10 damage and has the reach trait</li></ul><p>Each day during your daily preparations, you can decide if you want your weapon to deal bludgeoning damage and be in the club weapon group, deal piercing damage and be in the spear weapon group, or deal slashing damage and be in the sword weapon group. Your mind weapon is an extension of your mind-it has no Hardness, and any ability that would damage your mind weapon instead damages you directly, pushing back against the weapon's corporeal form and becoming mental damage of the same amount the weapon would have taken.</p><p>You can project your mind weapon using an Interact action, just as you would draw any other weapon. Only you can hold, carry, or wield your mind weapon; if held by another person, it quickly disappears from their hand, reforming in your mind for you to project again. If you're disarmed of your mind weapon, it dematerializes, but you can draw it again with an Interact action starting at the beginning of your next turn.</p><p>Upon creating your mind weapon, you also learn to use a mind smith's keepsake: an object of light Bulk, such as a bracelet or figurine, that you wear or keep on your person and inscribe with weapon runes. Your keepsake can't be a magic item, nor can it have any significant monetary value beyond the value of any runes you inscribe on it. You can buy and inscribe fundamental runes and weapon property runes onto your keepsake in the same way you would for a regular weapon, and you can move runes to and from your keepsake to other weapons or runestones for the usual cost. Any runes inscribed on the keepsake apply to your mind weapon when you create it. If your keepsake is ever lost or destroyed, you can spend 1 week of downtime imprinting a new object with your weapon's mental properties, though this new keepsake won't have any of the runes that were inscribed on the prior keepsake.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Malleable Movement] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.aMI39DZhWgNgJTAn inline hr=false]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ghost Blade] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.tor4lzY0wpNcJd2U inline hr=false]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Just the Tool] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.cB6K0wkiDhduAjtL inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Mental Forge] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.yantkiDNmsT5ONZX inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Mind Shards] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.xaSlCFYUXlu5f0zw inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Malleable Mental Forge] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.PccekOihIbRWdDky inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Mind Projectiles] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.P5Zu46vfO4ptBBoj inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Runic Mind Smithing] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 10</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.2uQbQgz1AbjzcFSp inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Metallic Envisionment] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.8KUvJuAWCoxWg5FH inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Advanced Runic Mind Smithing] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 16</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fgnfXwFcn9jZlXGD inline]</p>",

In fact, sometimes, those who don't understand pacts like you do might mistake the payment for the benefit, or vice versa. Perhaps an ancient being of nightmare demanded to consume something you sought to be rid of, like a painful memory or a negative personality trait, priding itself on how it was taking something personal from you. Little did it know, you let it win on haggling your end of the deal. Of course, this practice isn't without its own risks, as who knows what you might become without that part of you.</p><p>All these things, you can and must consider in every pact.

With other disciplines, the marks of experience accumulate as magic is learned, creating an equilibrium of sorts between the exercise of power and the necessary consequences. Time magic suffers no such limitations of cause and effect. Distortions and anachronistic thoughts echo back throughout a time mage's entire life, providing a nonlinear perspective that others can find distracting or even alien. The threat of creating a paradox is ever looming. Many a reckless time mage has inadvertently erased themselves from existence, glimpsed a future they now have no choice but to enact, or attracted the attentions of temporal creatures, such as iriis or siktemporas.</p><p>For these reasons, most mages merely dabble in time magic, learning a spell or two here and there.

A community might raise insects for certain byproducts, such as a bee's honey or a spider's silk, or tame larger versions of common species as mounts. Some even take this harmony to the extreme and willingly host a swarm of insects inside their bodies. Because of their unusual arrangement, swarmkeepers tend to live solitary lives, or at least as solitary as you can be as a host of thousands. When dealing with those who might be squeamish of their abilities, some swarmkeepers wear straw skeps, backpack-like boxes often employed by beekeepers as a kind of social camouflage. Such items might even be used to house additional insects if their swarm grows too big to fit inside their body.</p><p>Swarmkeepers can add new capabilities to their swarms. For some, this means incorporating many different species of insects into their swarm, making even mortal enemies in nature work together. Others selectively cultivate one kind of insect precious to them into various morphs that give the swarm new capabilities.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Swarmkeeper Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Nature</p><hr /><p>Your body has become a symbiotic hive for a swarm of crawling insects.

                "content": "<p>According to folklore, the thlipit martial art began with a wager. A group of bored tripkees looking for a little sport devised a game of using their tongues to gather fruit out of nearby trees. As the competition wore on and the bets escalated, the contestants began snatching falling fruit in midair and even using their tongues to push away the competition. While the names of the original competitors vary between tellings, all agree that the contest ended with a particularly magnificent tongue flick, landing an overripe mango squarely upon a losing bettor's head.</p><p>No matter the origin, variants of the game and the martial art it spawned have become mainstays in tripkee society. In contrast to other fighting styles, thlipit doesn't stand on ceremony or rigid discipline. Practitioners refer to themselves as contestants and play off the forms and moves as mere exercises or games. Despite this veneer of frivolity, thlipit can be just as dangerous in the mouth of an adept as any other weapon.</p><p>Thlipit combines fluid movements reminiscent of whip fighting with the leverage of a wrestler's stance. It favors quick smacks, brief grabs, and short throws. Friend, foe, and the contestant themselves always remain in motion. Moves are often exaggerated to play up stylish elements for spectators or lure brash opponents into attacking early.</p><p>No formal schools exist to teach thlipit. Many tripkees are familiar with the style from childhood games, even if they haven't developed the physicality to be considered a true contestant. Self-directed instruction remains common, though aspiring contestants will seek out veterans and ask to be taken on as apprentices. Even though this sort of self-directed instruction happens frequently, a veteran contestant will still occasionally take on a student or two to pass along particular forms or styles.</p><p>Though thlipit originated with tripkees, tripkee migration to Vidrian and other population centers has exposed other peoples to the sport. Most notably, thlipit has become popular with the recent generation of iruxi youth, who have adapted it for use with a tail rather than a tongue. Though not every move is possible with a tail, they have added their own innovations to the style.</p><p><strong>Additional Feats </strong>4th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Lunge]; 6th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Slam Down]; 12th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Crashing Slam]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Thlipit Contestant Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> You have a long prehensile tongue or a tail.

Baruk later fell in battle against a linnorm, successfully slaying the beast before succumbing to its death curse. His helm, soaked in the blood of man and linnorm and saturated with the magic of the linnorm's curse, was claimed by Baruk's daughter, who often told stories about the helm giving her a bear's strength and ferocity, though it was unclear at the time whether this was a boast.</p><p>Over many generations, the magic of the hood was proven true, and more than that, the magic continued to grow and evolve with ever-more-ursine attributes.

                "content": "<p>Battle harbingers are elite, specially trained members of their faith, usually carrying out missions that require extra martial prowess. Built for the battlefield and used to working alongside other warriors, as well as tackling dangerous solo operations, battle harbingers typically spend more time training outside their temples than praying within them. What they lack in spellcasting prowess they make up for with expertise in weaponry and defense.</p><p>Even less combat-oriented faiths understand that battle harbingers can be a necessity, especially if there's a dangerous quest that must be undertaken alone. Because battle harbingers rigorously train their bodies to withstand hardship, they tend to have more capability to support themselves, leaving more traditional priests to handle group-wide supportive magic and prayers.</p><p>Battle harbingers specialize in bolstering themselves with their deity's power and weakening their opponents in the same vein.</p><p>A battle harbinger's training varies greatly from that of a typical cleric. While this training initially resembles that of a warpriest cleric, the martial and spellcasting philosophies of a battle harbinger soon differ. A battle harbinger is taught to rely less on their spells, instead focusing on a select array of spells to supplement their combat abilities. Their main magical abilities focus on battle auras, spells that create areas centered on the battle harbinger that either empower their allies or hamper their foes. Battle harbingers are generally expected to take the fight directly to a foe, and their auras supplement these tactics.</p><p>The main component of a battle harbinger's training involves their battle creed. While a battle creed varies from faith to faith, the core aspects of these creeds remain the same regardless of dogma. A battle creed declares a battle harbinger to be a living weapon for their god or faith. The battle harbinger is expected to enter combat on behalf of their god and to adhere to strict training regimens that support this goal. Battle harbingers train to make use of powerful armor and their god's favored weapon. Supplemental training focuses on the body, allowing battle harbingers to stave off fatigue and dangers that target one's health directly. Some battle harbingers, such as those who follow Erastil, prefer to make use of ranged tactics, but they still learn more direct combat should the need arise.</p><p>Although a battle harbinger's spellcasting capabilities are more limited than their fellow clerics, their magic generally isn't less potent. Battle harbingers are still capable of calling down strong divine power, but they rely on this magic less often than their brethren. This is mostly due to their martial training, which focuses on their bodies, combat, and defense. As such, a battle harbinger doesn't carry as much magic potential as other clerics. The exception to this is their training in battle auras, which many battle harbingers are able to make greater use of as their prowess grows.</p><p>While most battle harbingers are associated with a given temple, it's not unusual for one to be a lone mercenary, enacting their deity's will along their travels and through their contract work.</p><h2>Battle Creed<span style=\"float:right\">1st</span></h2><p>You've undergone a special training to focus your body toward combat. While you still adhere to the teachings of your faith, you also know that you serve as an instrument of your church. More so than any warpriest, the physical rigors that come with battle are key to your training. You've dedicated yourself to the battle creed, a specific approach that puts combat prowess first, even at the expense of a cleric's typical spellcasting and restorative abilities. Defeating one's enemies is more important than healing an ally in the heat of battle; the time for healing comes after. As you abide by the battle creed, your physical and martial capabilities grow stronger. You must select Battle Herald Dedication as your 2ndlevel class feat.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> You must be a cleric.</p><p>You don't gain the Resolute Faith class feature.</p><p>You don't gain the Miraculous Spell class feature.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Adjustment:</strong> Your spellcasting capabilities are more restricted. At 1st level, you can prepare one 1st-rank spell and five cantrips. As you increase in level, your number of spell slots and the highest rank of spells you can cast from spell slots increases, shown in Battle Harbinger Spells per Day. Because of your focus on your physical training at the expense of magical aptitude, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest rank and, if you can cast 2nd-rank spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 rank lower than your highest spell rank. For anything that requires the ability to cast spells of a certain rank that's lower than the highest slots you have, you still qualify even if you no longer have spell slots at those ranks.</p><table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e lost-omens\"><thead><tr style=\"text-align:right\"><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Divine Font Adjustment:</strong> Instead of preparing heal or harm spells with your divine font, you instead gain the battle font, which allows you to prepare battle aura spells. You gain 4 additional spell slots each day at your highest rank of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only bane or bless in these slots. Any feats and effects that refer to a battle aura refers to these spells, regardless of whether they were cast with your standard spell slots or your divine font spell slots. At 5th level, the number of additional slots increases to 5, and at 15th level, the total number of additional slots increases to 6. Your battle auras use your class DC instead of your spell DC.</p><p><strong>Doctrine Adjustment:</strong> Instead of choosing a doctrine, you follow the battle creed. At 1st level, you gain the benefits of the initial creed. You gain additional benefits from your creed at the listed levels.</p><p><em>Initial Creed (1st):</em> You're trained in light and medium armor, and you have expert proficiency in Fortitude saves. You're trained in martial weapons. If your deity's favored weapon is a simple weapon or an unarmed attack, you gain the Deadly Simplicity cleric feat. At 13th level when you gain the Divine Defense class feature, you also gain expert proficiency in light and medium armor.</p><p><em>Lesser Creed (5th):</em> You gain expert proficiency with your deity's favored weapon, martial weapons, simple weapons, and unarmed attacks. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using your deity's favored weapon, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect. Your proficiency rank for your class DC increases to expert.</p><p><em>Moderate Creed (9th):</em> You gain Reactive Strike as a cleric feat.</p><p><em>Greater Creed (11th):</em> Your proficiency ranks for the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics increase to expert.</p><p><em>Major Creed (13th):</em> You gain master proficiency with your deity's favored weapon. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p><p><em>True Creed (15th):</em> Your proficiency rank for your class DC increases to master. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master.</p><p><em>Final Creed (19th):</em> Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmed defense, increase to master.

This chosen follower becomes a mortal herald, a living instrument for their god. Like a champion or cleric of a deity, a mortal herald has great divine power coursing through them, allowing the individual to enact the god's will within the Universe. Unlike a champion or cleric however, the god recognizes that their chosen mortal herald has skills and abilities that may be unique to them. Not every mortal herald is clad in impenetrable armor or capable of casting divine magic. Instead, the god grants gifts to their mortal herald that best match the individual's strengths. Regardless of who the person was before becoming a mortal herald, they are now a powerful divine being in their own right. Due to the specific needs of a deity and the dedicated nature of a mortal herald, a follower of a covenant or pantheon can't become a mortal herald.</p><p>In some cases, the god grants greater potential to their mortal heralds in the form of mythic power.

Separated from the regular members of this obscure league of scholars and academics, you have attained divine and occult abilities through methods kept secret to outsiders. The air of mystery that surrounds you and your organization only serves to aid you in your cases, which can often be dangerous investigations into cultists and supernatural threats. However, you might have earned the suspicion or ire of others within the Order of the Palatine Eye due to your near-constant field work and the fact that initiates and lower-order members are kept in the dark about your provenance.</p><p>You are likely unclear as to the exact source of your abilities. Depending on your understanding of your Order's teachings, you could have gained this power from the knowledge you gained through The Lost Gospels of Tabris. This knowledge seems to hint at greater mysteries underlying existence and the cosmos, as well as mysteries hidden between the veils of morality that suffuse the planes, which could have unlocked your potential. It could also be that you gained your abilities due to your connection to the various artifacts and relics that the Order of the Palatine Eye has collected over its lifetime. The nature of many of these items remains unclear even after decades of study, but your proximity to these relics could have triggered an awakening of abilities. Your abilities might simply function because you believe they must. It would be disastrous for you to lose access to these abilities, so you believe them to function and considerations otherwise are something you refuse to acknowledge.</p><p>Regardless, you've learned to make use of your abilities to work against magical forces. These abilities allow you to tap into greater magical potential, create wards to protect yourself from magical attacks, and even grant you esoteric insight to better harm your foes. While these abilities are potent, you must also make sure to not let your Order training lapse. You make use of your mind, your canny insight, and deductive skills to deal with the various mysteries of existence that you encounter and the supernatural foes that you find along the way.</p><h2>Palatine Detective<span style=\"float:right\">1st</span></h2><p>Whether at the invitation of a senior member of the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye, after going through a rigorous sorting process, or by a twist of fate, you recently underwent a secret ritual involving The Lost Gospels of Tabris that granted you a greater understanding of both the divine and the occult. Not even you are certain of the origin or purpose of the forces that have granted you these abilities, but you know the key to answering that question and expanding your power lies hidden behind the cryptic words of the many ancient texts still waiting to be discovered and examined. If you choose this class archetype, you must select Palatine Detective Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.</p><p>Prerequisites: You must be an investigator. You are affiliated with the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye.</p><p>Palatine Detective Adjustments: Instead of choosing a methodology from others available to the investigator class, you have the esoterica methodology.</p><p>Additional Feats: 6th Cast Out, Thaumaturgic Ritualist.</p><h2>Esoterica Methodology</h2><p>You become trained in Occultism or Religion, and you gain the Quick Identification skill feat. In addition, choose one common cantrip from the divine spell list and one common cantrip from the occult spell list. You can cast those spells as innate spells at will. You become trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DCs statistics. Intelligence is your spellcasting attribute.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Palatine Detective Dedication] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.LlTIbv1py77nACkI inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Esoteric Spellcasting] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.YtfmSKoUFjnqEH0T inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Text Decoder] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.CR23F2O59fc70RXM inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Palatine Enchantment] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.UVgRZf3zHV8aXa5L inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Palatine Strike] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.OfKfYPrlxo8jdqmp inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Challenge Insight] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.bvyCaOChX3lwKUn8 inline hr=false]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Cursebreaker] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 10</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.f1gxSpqjYryc1yc4 inline hr=false]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Greater Esoteric Spellcasting] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.cIClNoUqtX2SGWfz inline]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Open the Blazing Eye] <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 10</span></h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.lFc7HTNUCUemzSiV inline hr=false]</p>",
