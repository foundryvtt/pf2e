This uses the highest attack bonus among the zombie's Strikes and deals @Damage[1d12[acid]] damage per 3 levels of the zombie (or @Damage[1d6[acid]] damage below level 3). On a critical hit, the target also takes @Damage[1d4[persistent,acid]] damage per 3 levels of the zombie. Once used, the zombie must spend 1 action to cough up enough acid to use this ability again.</p>"
