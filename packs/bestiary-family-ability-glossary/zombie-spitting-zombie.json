This uses the highest attack bonus among the zombie's Strikes and deals [[/r 1d12[acid]]] damage per 3 levels of the zombie (or [[/r 1d6[acid]]] damage below level 3). On a critical hit, the target also takes [[/r 1d4[persistent,acid]]] damage per 3 levels of the zombie. Once used, the zombie must spend 1 action to cough up enough acid to use this ability again.</p>"
