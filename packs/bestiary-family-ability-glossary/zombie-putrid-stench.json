A creature that enters the area must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:] save. On a failure, the creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1}, and on a critical failure, the creature also takes a -5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. While within the aura, the creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saves to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to all zombies' putrid stenches for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-effects.Item.Effect: Putrid Stench]</p>"
