The creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 day; this is a curse effect that uses the Will save DC as the counteract DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 2} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 2}.</p>"
