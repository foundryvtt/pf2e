It grows to Huge size, and its reach increases to 15 feet. It also gains 12 temporary Hit Points, resistance 5 to bludgeoning, and a +2 status bonus to damage rolls, but it's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1}. When the Melfesh Monster takes damage while swollen, all creatures within 15 feet inhale spores that remain in their body for 1 minute. This ability replaces terrorspores and Spore Cloud.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-effects.Item.Effect: Swell]</p>"
