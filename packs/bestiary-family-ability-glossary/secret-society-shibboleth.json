A creature specifically gauging the conversation, such as with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sense Motive], can attempt a secret Perception check against the secret society member's Deception DC to notice something secret has been communicated, after which they can attempt a Society check against the same DC. On a success, they discover the rough topic of the message; on a critical success, they discover the exact message.</p>"
