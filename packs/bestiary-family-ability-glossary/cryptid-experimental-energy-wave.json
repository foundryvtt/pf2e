Creatures in the area take [[/r 1d6[damagetype]]]{1d6 damage per level of the cryptid} with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:|basic:true] save. The experimental cryptid can use this ability once every [[/r 1d4 #Energy Wave Recharge]]{1d4 rounds}. This action has the damage type's trait. If the experiments that reshaped the creature were magical, this action also has the evocation trait and the trait matching the magical tradition of the experiments (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).</p>"
