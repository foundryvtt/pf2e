The lich Recalls Information with a skill of their choice, using the target's bonus with the skill instead of their own. If there's a very specific piece of information the lich hopes to uncover, and the target knows that information, the target can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:] save to keep it secret. On a critical success, the target can give the lich faulty information instead.</p>"
