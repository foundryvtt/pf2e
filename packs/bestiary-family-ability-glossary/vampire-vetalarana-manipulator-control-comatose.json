This has the effects of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Possession]</em> spell, but lasts for up to 6 hours, has a range of 1 mile, and the vetalarana can control a number of comatose victims at a time equal to half the vetalarana's level. A comatose victim can't resist this possession and automatically gets a critical failure on its saving throw against Control Comatose.</p>\n<p>As long as a comatose victim is controlled by a vetalarana manipulator in this way, the victim's stupefied and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious] conditions are temporarily suppressed.</p>"
