If the flat check succeeds, the siabrae's body crumbles to dust and absorbs into the earth. After [[/br 1d10 #days]]{1d10 days}, the siabrae's body reforms from a mass of unworked stone large enough to create a new body; this stone is in a random location within 1d10 miles of where the siabrae was destroyed. The siabrae emerges from the stone with a peal of thunder, though without any of their gear.</p>"
