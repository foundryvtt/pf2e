Instead, they disperse into an immense number of individual rats heading in every direction in an attempt to return to their coffin. If even a single rat reaches the coffin, the nosferatu can recover. A nosferatu regains their strength through resting in earth taken from the grave of a creature who died of plague. If their body rests in their earth-filled coffin for 1 hour, the nosferatu gains 1 HP, after which their fast healing begins to function normally. If the coffin doesn't contain this plagued grave dirt, they instead need to rest in their coffin for 1 day before they gain 1 HP and regain their fast healing.</p>"
