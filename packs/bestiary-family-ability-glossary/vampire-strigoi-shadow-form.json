            "value": "<p>The strigoi reverts to pure shadow and absorbs its body and its gear into the darkness, or it shifts back to its physical form. In shadow form, the strigoi gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed and can move through any gap that isn't airtight. However, it can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed, the strigoi returns to physical form and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 1}. The strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely.</p>\n<p>A strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 2} and must attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:16] at the end of each of its turns. If it fails this flat check, it is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail.</p>"
