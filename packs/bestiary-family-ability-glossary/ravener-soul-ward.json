A soul ward has 150 maximum Hit Points, or 200 if the ravener is level 21 or higher.</p>\n<p>Whenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 Hit Point, all damage in excess of what would reduce them to 1 Hit Point is instead dealt to their soul ward. If this damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 Hit Points, the ravener is destroyed.</p>\n<p>A soul ward's Hit Points can be restored only via specific ravener abilities such as Consume Soul, ravenous breath, or vicious criticals. A ravener who goes more than a week without successfully using Consume Soul to feed on a dying creature starves, and their soul ward loses [[/r {1d4} #Soul Ward Decay]]{1d4 Hit Points} each day until they feed. If the ravener's soul ward loses all its Hit Points while the ravener still has more than 1 HP, they become a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-2.Actor.Ravener Husk].</p>"
