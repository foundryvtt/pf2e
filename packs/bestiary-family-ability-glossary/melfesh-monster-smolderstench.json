A creature that enters or begins its turn in the area inhales spores and must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:21|name:Smolderstench] save. On a failure, the creature takes @Damage[2d4[poison]] damage and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1}; on a critical failure, the creature also takes @Damage[4[persistent,poison]] damage and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 2}. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to smolderstench for 1 minute. This ability replaces terrorspores.</p>"
