This can't disguise any creatures in the area, though it can cause minor, cosmetic changes (like causing a creature's clothing to appear nicer for a party or bloodstained for a battle).</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches the illusion or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve it. Creatures can't leave the area of the illusion until they successfully disbelieve it.</p>"
