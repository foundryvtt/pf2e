The secret society member either Creates a Diversion or Feints. If they @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Create a Diversion], it doesn't gain either the auditory, linguistic, or manipulate trait (since someone else has provided the diversion), and onlookers who have already been diverted by the secret society member don't receive a +4 circumstance bonus against the attempt. If they @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Feint], they don't need to be in melee reach of their target, and the benefit applies to both melee and ranged attacks against their target.</p>"
