As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with the nymph queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves.</p>\n<p>If a nymph queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and the nymph queen is that bard's muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for lore muse, the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-effects.Item.Effect: Nymph Queen's Inspiration]</p>"
