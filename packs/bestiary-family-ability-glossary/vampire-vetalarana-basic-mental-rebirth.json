Instead, their body is destroyed, crumbling to ash, and their mind is immediately transferred into a creature they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. This creature must be within 1 mile; if no such creature is in range, the vetalarana is destroyed. The creature becomes controlled by the vetalarana and loses the stupefied and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious] conditions. If the creature controlled by a vetalarana in this way is killed, the vetalarana's mind transfers to another creature within 1 mile who they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts.</p>\n<p>After [[/br 1d6 #days]]{1d6 days} of being controlled, the controlled creature dies, and its body transforms into that of the vetalarana who rendered it comatose.</p>"
