This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions.</p>\n<p>The victim is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 1} and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.</p>\n<p>A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a @Check[type:medicine|dc:20|name:Blood Transfusion] check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.</p>"
