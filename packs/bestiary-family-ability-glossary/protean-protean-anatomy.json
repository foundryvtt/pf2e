Immediately after the protean takes acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes first. The protean is immune to polymorph effects unless it is a willing target. If @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Blinded] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Deafened], the protean automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-effects.Item.Effect: Protean Anatomy]</p>"
