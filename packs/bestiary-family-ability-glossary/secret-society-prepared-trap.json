The secret society member chooses an unoccupied space within 60 feet and activates a snare hidden there; the snare can be any common snare of the secret society's member's level - 2 or lower (minimum level 1). From this point on, creatures can trigger the snare as normal. During the activation, the secret society member must attempt a @Check[type:deception] check against the Perception DCs of creatures observing them; on a failure, those creatures realize where the secret society member activated the snare.</p>"
