Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait (@Check[type:will|dc:]). The save DC uses the DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.</p>"
