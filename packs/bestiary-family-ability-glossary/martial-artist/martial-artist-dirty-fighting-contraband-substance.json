The item is usually a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Juggernaut Mutagen (Lesser)], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Quicksilver Mutagen (Lesser)]. This ability can't be used again until the martial artist has time to acquire and hide a new mutagen. Some martial artists use concealed small vials, but others hide a syringe or soak the alchemical liquid into a garment they can put in their mouth.</p>"
