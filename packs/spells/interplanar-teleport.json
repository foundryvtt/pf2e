The targets move to another plane, such as the Plane of Fire, the Netherworld, or the Outer Rifts. You must know the destination plane exists and use a magic planar key created from material from that plane as a locus for the spell. While the planar keys for most prominent planes are uncommon, just like the spell <em>interplanar teleport</em>, more obscure planes and demiplanes often have rare or possibly even unique planar keys.</p>\n<p>The spell is highly imprecise, and you appear 1d20×25 miles from the last place one of the targets (of your choice) was located the last time that target traveled to the plane. If it's the first time traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you appear at a random location on the plane. <em>Interplanar teleport</em> doesn't provide a means of return travel, though casting <em>interplanar teleport</em> again allows you to return to your previous plane unless there are extenuating circumstances.</p>"
