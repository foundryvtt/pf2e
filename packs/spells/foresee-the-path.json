Make a @Check[type:perception]{Perception check} against the target enemy's Will DC or Deception DC, whichever is higher. The GM may judge a different DC is more appropriate if it's higher; for instance, using the Warfare Lore DC of a military captain. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target ally gains a reaction that lets it make a melee @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Strike] against the target enemy, triggered if the enemy leaves a square within the ally's reach. If the ally already has an ability that lets it make melee Strikes as a reaction, such as Attack of Opportunity, the ally can forgo gaining the temporary reaction to instead gain a +2 status bonus to melee Strikes it makes as reactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the status bonus an ally gets if it forgoes the reaction is +1.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The spell has no effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Amp</strong> The spell has the same result on a failure as on a success (but still no effect on a critical failure). Each time you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sustain a Spell]{Sustain the Spell}, you can choose an additional ally to target, granting them the same benefit as the initial target ally.</p>"
