They're trained with them. When attacking with these attacks, the target uses their attack modifier with the proficiency and item bonuses of their most favorable weapon or unarmed Strike, and the damage is listed for each attack. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled] condition, for example).
