Unlike normal void damage, the void damage from <em>withering grasp</em> damages objects, constructs, and the like by eroding them away.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Your touch deals double damage (both initial and persistent). If you target an object, lower its Hardness by 4 for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Your touch deals full damage. If you target an object, lower its Hardness by 2 for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d12 and the persistent damage increases by 1.
