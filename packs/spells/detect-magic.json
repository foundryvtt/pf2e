You detect illusion magic only if that magic's effect has a lower rank than the rank of your <em>detect magic</em> spell. However, items that have an illusion aura but aren't deceptive in appearance (such as an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Invisibility Potion]) typically are detected normally.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> You learn the rank or level of the most powerful magical effect the spell detects, as determined by the GM.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> As 3rd rank, but you also pinpoint the source of the highest-rank magic.
