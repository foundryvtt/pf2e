These squares become difficult terrain until the start of your next turn. You can use <em>river carving mountains</em> while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.Spell Effect: River Carving Mountains]</p>"
