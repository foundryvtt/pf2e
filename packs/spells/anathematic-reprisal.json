You can cast this spell only when a creature actively commits a unique act of anathema. For example, if creating undead were anathema to your deity, you could use anathematic reprisal on a necromancer who had just created undead in front of you, but not on an undead creature just for existing. You deal 4d6 mental damage to the target, but a basic Will save can reduce this damage. If it fails, it is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 round. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d6.</p>"
