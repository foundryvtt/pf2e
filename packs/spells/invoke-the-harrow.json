You use the power of the card's suit to influence a creature around you. When you draw a card, you can choose to impart a boon or bane associated with the card's suit. The target must attempt a Will save. On a failure, they receive the effects of the chosen boon or bane. If you target an ally with this spell, they can choose to willingly accept the effects without attempting a saving throw. The target can attempt to remove the card's influence by using an action, which has the concentrate trait, to attempt the saving throw again; on a success, the effect ends.</p>\n<p>To determine the card, draw a card from a harrow deck. If you don't have a harrow deck available, you can roll 1d6 to randomly determine the suit you draw.</p>\n<p><strong>1.
