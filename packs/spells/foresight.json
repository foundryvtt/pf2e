If you choose a creature other than yourself as the target, you create a psychic link through which you can inform the target of danger. This link is a mental effect. Due to the amount of information this spell requires you to process, you can't have more than one <em>foresight</em> spell in effect at a time. Casting <em>foresight</em> again ends the previous <em>foresight</em>. While <em>foresight</em> is in effect, the target gains a +2 status bonus to initiative rolls and isn't @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] against @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Undetected] creatures or when flanked. In addition, you gain the following reaction: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Foresight]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.Spell Effect: Foresight]</p>"
