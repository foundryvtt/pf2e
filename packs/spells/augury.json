The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveal the GM's best guess among the following outcomes: good, bad, mixed (the results will be a mix of good and bad), and nothing (there won't be particularly good or bad results).</p>\n<p>The GM rolls a secret @Check[type:flat|dc:6|showDC:all|traits:secret]. On a failure, the result is always \"nothing.\" This makes it impossible to tell whether a \"nothing\" result is accurate. If anyone asks about the same topic as the first casting of <em>augury</em> during an additional casting, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting. If circumstances change, though, it's possible to get a different result.</p>"
