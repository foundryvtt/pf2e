If this is enough to prevent the attack from bringing you to 0 Hit Points, you don't become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dying]. Either way, cheating death is difficult, and you can't use <em>hero's defiance</em> again until you Refocus or the next time you prepare. <em>Hero's defiance</em> cannot be used against effects with the death trait or that would leave no remains, such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Disintegrate].</p>"
