If you spend 3 actions casting the spell, you can avoid finishing the spell and spend another 3 actions on your next turn to empower the spell even further. If you choose to do so, the damage dealt by this spell increases by 4d4, and you enter a shining state for 1 minute, causing you to glow with light and deal @Damage[1[force]] damage to creatures that end their turn adjacent to you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The initial damage, as well as the additional damage for the 2-round casting time, each increase by 4d4, and the damage to adjacent creatures dealt while in your shining state increases by 1.</p>"
