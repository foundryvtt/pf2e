A creature floating in the air from levitate takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. A floating creature can spend an Interact action to stabilize itself and negate this penalty for the remainder of its turn. If the target is adjacent to a fixed object or terrain of suitable stability, it can move across the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical, like a wall) or crawling (if the surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling). The GM determines which surfaces can be climbed or crawled across.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.Spell Effect: Levitate]</p>"
