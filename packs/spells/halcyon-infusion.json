The spell must be one that has a listed range.

If they are untrained in the appropriate magical tradition, their spell attack bonus is 2 + their level + their highest mental ability modifier, and their spell DC is 12 + their level + their highest mental ability modifier.</p>\n<p>Unlike most abilities that can only be used once per day, the target refreshes their use of the granted innate spell each day only after you make your daily preparations and choose to extend halcyon infusion's duration by either refraining from preparing a spell in the slot (if you're a prepared spellcaster) or expending another spell slot (if you're a spontaneous spellcaster).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> If the target is at least 7th level, you can choose a 4th-rank spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> As 8th, and if the target is at least 9th level, you can choose a 5th-rank spell.</p>"
