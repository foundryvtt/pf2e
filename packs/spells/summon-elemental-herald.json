            "value": "<p>Your meditation into the different elemental planes connects you to them deeply, and this connection allows you to summon a herald of an elemental lord. The herald arrives in the form of a natural disaster centralized on your enemies. The herald occupies the space of a Huge creature. When you Cast this Spell, choose one of the elemental heralds below to summon; if you're a divine spellcaster who worships an elemental lord, you must choose the option matching your deity's element. This spell gains the trait (air, earth, fire, metal, water, or wood) matching your choice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Air</strong> Speed fly 60 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong>(air) <em>Supercell Front</em> The herald of air arrives in the form of a twisting tornado, with high-speed winds slamming into your enemies. Each enemy in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:100] takes @Damage[10d8[bludgeoning]] damage with a basic Fortitude save; <strong>Depart</strong> (air) <em>Twister Downdraft</em> Each enemy in a @Template[type:line|distance:60] must attempt a Fortitude save. A creature that fails is knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone] if it's on the ground or descends 40 feet if it's in the air. A creature that descends takes falling damage if this forced movement brings it to the ground.</li>\n<li><strong>Earth</strong> Speed 50 feet, burrow 30 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong>(earth) <em>Tectonic Rise</em> The herald of earth erupts from the ground, splitting it open in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:50]. Each enemy in the emanation takes @Damage[10d6[slashing]] damage from the flying debris with a basic Reflex save. Enemies who critically fail fall 30 feet into the crevasse, taking falling damage (the sides of the fissure require successful @Check[type:athletics|dc:15] checks to Climb); <strong>Depart</strong> (sonic)<em> Plate Crash </em>The herald of earth sinks back into the ground, and the sides of the crevasse slam together with a deafening blow, dealing @Damage[5d10[sonic]] damage with a basic Fortitude save to all enemies in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30]. An enemy that critically fails is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Deafened] for 10 minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>Fire</strong> Speed 60 feet, fly 40 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong>(fire) <em>Magma Flow</em> The herald of fire flows into the area as living magma, dealing @Damage[10d6[fire]] damage and @Damage[3d6[persistent,fire]] damage to all enemies in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:60] with a basic Reflex save; <strong>Depart</strong>(fire) <em>Flame Vortex</em> Each enemy in a 60-foot line takes @Damage[6d6[fire]] damage and @Damage[3d6[persistent,fire]] damage with a basic Reflex save as the fire herald whips into a fire pillar before vanishing.</li>\n<li><strong>Metal</strong> Speed 50 feet, fly 50 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong>(metal)<em> Shard Cloud</em> The herald of metal arrives as a cloud of metal shards and static electricity, dealing @Damage[4d8[slashing]] damage and @Damage[4d12[electricity]] damage to all enemies in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:50] with a basic Reflex save; <strong>Depart</strong>(metal) <em>Rust Mist </em>The shards in the cloud rapidly rust and cling to enemies in the @Template[type:emanation|distance:50], dealing 10d6 damage to metal creatures and objects in the area with a basic Reflex save, ignoring Hardness. Unattended objects automatically critically fail this save.</li>\n<li><strong>Water</strong> Speed 40 feet, swim 60 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong>(cold, water) <em>Hurricane Formation</em> The herald of water forms as a miniature hurricane. Each enemy in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:60] takes @Damage[4d10[bludgeoning]] damage from the slamming rains and @Damage[4d10[cold]] damage from the falling hail with a basic Fortitude save; <strong>Depart</strong>(cold, water) <em>Cataclysmic Deluge</em> The hurricane collapses into a rushing flood, dealing @Damage[6d8[bludgeoning]] damage to all enemies in a @Template[type:cone|distance:120] with a basic Fortitude save. A creature that fails its save is pushed 20 feet away from the herald (or 40 feet on a critical failure).</li>\n<li><strong>Wood</strong> Speed 50 feet, burrow 30 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong>(plant, wood) <em>Advantageous Roots</em> The herald of wood bursts forth from the ground as a complex root system. Each enemy in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:50] takes @Damage[6d10[piercing]] damage with a basic Reflex save as the roots skewer its limbs and body. Each enemy that fails its save takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speeds until the herald departs; <strong>Depart</strong>(plant, wood) <em>Retreat to Soil</em> The roots retreat into the ground, dealing @Damage[6d10[piercing]] damage to each enemy in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:50] with a basic Reflex save. Any creature with a penalty to Speeds from its initial save automatically takes @Damage[2d6[persistent,bleed]] damage. The ground in the emanation is difficult terrain after the roots retreat.</li>\n</ul>"
