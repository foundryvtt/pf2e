It doesn't even fully trust its own ability to Recall Knowledge, as it becomes convinced it most likely remembered false information, as from a critical failure on a check to Recall Knowledge.</p>\n<p>Finally, the creature takes 6d6 mental damage at the end of each of its turns (with no save) unless it spent at least 1 action that turn Seeking or otherwise interacting with its surroundings in an attempt to disbelieve the illusions that it feels are obviously surrounding it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is affected for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is affected for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is affected for 1 hour.</p>"
