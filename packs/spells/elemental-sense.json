They appear to you as translucent shapes, and they are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] to you.</li>\n<li><strong>Tremorsense</strong>(earth) You gain tremorsense (imprecise) with a range of 30 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Woodsense</strong>(plant, wood) You can sense creatures carrying wood items with a total of 1 Bulk or greater; this is an imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet.
