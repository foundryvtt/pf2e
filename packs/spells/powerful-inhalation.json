A creature that critically fails can't speak or use abilities that require it to breathe for 1 round. This prevents it from using effects that require speech, such as casting spells with verbal components, and from using a breath weapon or similar ability.</p>\n<p>Creatures made of air (such as air elementals) attempting a save against this spell get a degree of success one worse than they rolled.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> Increase the damage by 2d6.</p>"
