Within the area of effect, incorporeal creatures can't pass through solid objects or corporeal creatures, and they can manipulate and attempt Strength-based checks against physical creatures and objects. An incorporeal PC or other creature with a normal Strength modifier simply uses that modifier, but if the creature had a Strength modifier of â€“5, like most incorporeal monsters, it uses a +4 modifier instead, increasing its Athletics modifier by 9 accordingly. Attacks against creatures that are within the area overcome resistances as if they were by ghost touch weapons.</p>"
