The scales' color depends on the damage type you chose, such as red or orange for fire damage.</p>\n<p>The scales store up energy as they protect you. Keep track of how much damage the scales have prevented. As a 2-action activity that has the concentrate and manipulate traits, you can explode your scales outward in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:20], dealing 1d6 damage of the chosen type to all creatures in the area for every 10 damage the scales have prevented, to a maximum of 10d6 damage (after preventing 100 damage). Each creature in the area must attempt a basic Reflex save. Once you do so, the spell ends.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The resistance increases by 5, and the maximum damage from the scale explosion increases by 5d6.</p>"
