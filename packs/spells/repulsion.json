A creature must attempt a Will save if it's within the area when you cast the spell or as soon as it enters the area while the spell is in effect. Once a creature has attempted the save, it uses the same result for that casting of repulsion. Any restrictions on a creature's movement apply only if it voluntarily moves toward you. For example, if you move closer to a creature, it doesn't then need to move away.</p>\n<hr /><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature's movement is not restricted.\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature treats each square in the area as difficult terrain when moving closer to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature can't move closer to you within the area.</p>"
