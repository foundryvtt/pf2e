A circle of light carves its way across the ground as you create your very own runewell, your personal rune flaring to life within it as you add your own sin to those seven revered in the past. Whenever any creature Casts a Spell within your personal runewell, the well resonates, with your choice of effects.</p><ul><li><p>The runewell amplifies the power of your spells, as well as those of your allies. If the spell deals damage and doesn't have a duration, the well adds a status bonus to damage equal to the spell's rank.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.Spell Effect: Personal Runewell]</p></li><li>The runewell punishes enemies foolish enough to attempt magic in your seat of power, firing arcane bolts at the spell's caster that deal 4d6 force damage, with a basic Reflex save.</li></ul><p>If you cast personal runewell a second time, your previous personal runewell vanishes. You can Dismiss the spell.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The amount of damage dealt by the runewell's bolts increases by 1d6.</p><hr /><p><em>PFS Note:</em> Within the area of a <em>personal runewell</em> spell, the caster chooses the effect each time a spell is cast.
