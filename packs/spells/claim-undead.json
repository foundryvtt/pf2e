It (or the creature previously controlling it) can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and the spell ends on a success. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target (or the creature previously controlling it) receives a new save only if yo give it a new order that is against its nature.</p>"
