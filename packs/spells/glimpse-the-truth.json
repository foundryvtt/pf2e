Each time a new illusion comes into the aura during the duration of the spell, the GM attempts a secret counteract check for that illusion.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> You can allow everyone within range of the emanation to see through illusions you succeed against, not just yourself.</p>"
