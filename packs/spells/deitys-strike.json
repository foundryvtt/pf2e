It emits in a 10-foot-wide, 30-foot-long line starting from the target and continuing in a direction you choose. Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). Your target and any other creatures within the area of the spell take [[/r 5d6]] damage of the chosen alignment type, with a basic Reflex save. The spell gains the trait of the alignment you choose. If your deity is true neutral, the weapon doesn't create a shock wave.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The force damage increases by 1d12 and the alignment damage increases by 1d6.
