The space is unadorned and empty, with chalk lines indicating the corners of the walls.</p>\n<p>If the drawing is scrubbed away, the underlying surface is broken, or a creature attempts to enter the space that would put it over capacity, the space begins to collapse. The space ejects one creature at random each round, depositing it on the nearest open ground, until all creatures are returned outside.</p>"
