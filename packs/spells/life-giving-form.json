You gain resistance 5 to precision damage and weakness 5 to void damage, and your unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1d4 vitality damage. You can touch a living creature with an Interact action to restore @Damage[(@item.level)d8[healing,vitality]|shortLabel:true] Hit Points to it, and when a creature touches you with an Interact action you can allow it to gain the same healing; either way, the creature becomes temporarily immune to life-giving form's healing for 1 minute. This is a vitality healing effect. You can't heal yourself with life-giving form. A creature harmed by vitality damage (such as an undead) that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon instead takes @Damage[(3d4 + (@item.level - 6))[vitality]] damage, and it doesn't become temporarily immune. You can Dismiss this spell.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.Spell Effect: Life-Giving Form]</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The Hit Points restored with an Interact action increases by 1d8, the vitality damage increases by 1, and the resistance and weakness increases by 1</p>"
