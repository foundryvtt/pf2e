You ride along in the body while the spell lasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You possess the target and take partial control of it. You no longer have a separate turn; instead, you might control the target. At the start of each of the target's turns, it attempts another Will save. If it fails, it's controlled by you on that turn; if it succeeds, it chooses its own actions; and if it critically succeeds, it forces you out and the spell ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You possess the target fully, and it can only watch as you manipulate it like a puppet. The target is controlled by you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The duration is 10 minutes, and you can physically enter the creature's body, protecting your physical body while the spell lasts.</p>"
