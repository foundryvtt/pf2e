A creature that moves through the area takes @Damage[5[slashing]] damage per square traversed.</p>\n<p>If a creature takes slashing, piercing, or persistent bleed damage while inside the thicket, you can spend a reaction to grow the iron in the shed blood into additional wires, expanding the burst by 5 feet. You can grow the area four times in this way, to a maximum of a @Template[type:burst|distance:40].</p>\n<p>The barbed wires are made of the metal you chose and activate resistances, weaknesses, and the like normally.
