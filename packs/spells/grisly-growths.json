The target takes 10d6 piercing damage (basic Fortitude save) as the new features erupt. This spell has no effect on a target with a mutable anatomy or no limbs, such as an ooze or a protean. The growths rot rapidly and fall away after 1 round.</p>\n<p>In addition, unless the initial target critically succeeds, creatures within 30 feet of the target, including the target, must attempt @Check[type:will|traits:mental,visual] saves, after which they are temporarily immune to this secondary effect of <em>grisly growths</em> for 1 hour. This additional effect is a mental and visual effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1}.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The character is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 2}.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 2d6.</p>"
