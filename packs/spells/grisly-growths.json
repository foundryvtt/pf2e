The target takes @Damage[10d6[piercing]] damage (basic Fortitude save) as the new features erupt. This spell has no effect on a target with a mutable anatomy or no limbs, such as an ooze or a protean. The growths rot rapidly and fall away after 1 round.</p>\n<p>In addition, unless the initial target critically succeeds, creatures within 30 feet of the target, including the target, must attempt Will saves, after which they are temporarily immune to this secondary effect of <em>grisly growths</em> for 1 hour. This additional effect is a mental and visual effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1}.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The character is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 2}.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by @Damage[2d6[piercing]].</p>"
