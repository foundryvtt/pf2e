You move half as quickly as usual while climbing with your guts (minimum 5 feet), but you can attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] check whenever you critically fail to prevent a fall. Other creatures can use your guts to climb like a squishy rope, but the guts don't help anyone but you attach to a wall.
