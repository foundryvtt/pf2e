If you have a Lore skill appropriate to the creature, you can use that skill instead of Medicine. If you succeed, the next time you deal piercing or slashing damage to the target with a Strike or spell, you deal 4d6 additional precision damage. Once on each of your subsequent turns, you can use a single action to attempt the special Recall Knowledge check again. The extra damage isn't cumulative, so making the check more than once before a Strike or spell has no extra benefit.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.Spell Effect: Organsight]</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The precision damage increases by [[/r 1d6]]{1d6}.</p>"
