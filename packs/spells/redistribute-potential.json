Creatures in either area take 4d4 damage with a @Check[type:fortitude|basic:true]{basic Fortitude save}. Choose one of the squares to steal heat, dealing cold damage, and the other to concentrate the stolen heat, dealing fire damage. A creature that fails its save also becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1} from numbness if it's in the area of stolen heat or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} from heat stroke if it's in the area of concentrated heat; these conditions last until the start of your next turn. If a creature is large enough to be in both squares, you choose only one of the areas for it to attempt its save against; it's unaffected by the other area.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d4.</p>"
