Creatures in either area take [[/r 4d4]]{4d4} damage with a @Check[type:fortitude|basic:true]{basic Fortitude save}. Choose one of the squares to steal heat, dealing cold damage, and the other to concentrate the stolen heat, dealing fire damage. A creature that fails its save also becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1} from numbness if it's in the area of stolen heat or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} from heat stroke if it's in the area of concentrated heat; these conditions last until the start of your next turn. If a creature is large enough to be in both squares, you choose only one of the areas for it to attempt its save against; it's unaffected by the other area.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by [[/r 1d4]]{1d4}.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Amp</strong> You can affect the flow of energy on a much grander scale. Instead of two 5-foot squares, you create two @Template[type:burst|distance:10]{10 foot bursts}. They still must be adjacent to one another and can overlap. A creature in both areas can still be affected by only one of your choice. The spell's damage increases to [[/r 6d6]]{6d6}. The conditions last for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Amp Heightened (+1)</strong> Increase the damage by [[/r 2d6]]{2d6} instead of 1d4.</p>"
