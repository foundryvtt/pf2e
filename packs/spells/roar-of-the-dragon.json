The GM decides if a creature is aligned enough with dragonkind to be affected in this way. All enemies within the area other than dragons must attempt a Will save; to these enemies, roar of the dragon is a fear effect.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 1}.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 2}.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 3} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fleeing] for 1 round.</p>"
