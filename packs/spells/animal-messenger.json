The animal does its best to reach the destination; if it makes it there, it waits nearby and allows nonhostile creatures to approach and remove the attached object. The spell ends after the message is delivered or after 24 hours, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p>If there are no Tiny wild animals in range, the spell is lost.</p>"
