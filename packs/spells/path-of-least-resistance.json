If some of the paths contain a hidden danger, such as a trap that you would trigger by walking into the trap's affected area, the GM doesn't consider this path when randomly determining which one you take, but if all options have a hidden danger, the GM randomly chooses between all three paths. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.</p>"
