It takes half the damage you would have taken, while you take the rest. If you would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, you're reduced to 1 instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, except they take the full damage. If the damage reduces them to 0 Hit Points, they immediately die; this is a death effect.</p><hr /><p><em>PFS Note:</em> This spell can only be cast on a friendly NPC with GM approval, and on a PC with their player's approval.</p>"
