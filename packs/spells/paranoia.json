It uses its reactions and free actions against everyone, regardless of whether they were previously its allies, as determined by the GM. It otherwise acts as rationally as it normally does and likely prefers to attack creatures that are actively attacking or hindering it over those leaving it alone.</p>\n<hr /><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> You can target up to 5 creatures."
