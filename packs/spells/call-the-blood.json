If you're a living creature and don't have void healing, you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 2}. If you're undead (or living but have void healing), you can choose to either gain temporary Hit Points equal to half of the void damage the target takes (after applying resistance and the like) and become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Quickened] for 1 round, or forgo the temporary Hit Points and become quickened for 1 minute. You can use this extra action only to Step, Stride, or Strike. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by @Damage[2d4[void]].</p>"
