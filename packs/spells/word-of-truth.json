This assurance of honesty grants you a +2 status bonus to Diplomacy checks as long as the symbol persists. You can Dismiss the spell, and if you say something that you don't believe is entirely true, the spell ends before you complete your statement.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.Spell Effect: Word of Truth]</p>"
