The target can give a brief response as a reaction, or as a free action on their next turn if they wish, but they must be able to see you and be within range to do so. If they respond, their response is delivered directly to your ear, just like the original message.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> The spell's range increases to 500 feet.</p>"
