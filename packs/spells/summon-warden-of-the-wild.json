            "value": "<p>You briefly call forth the spirit of one of the Wardens of the Wild, the legendary guardians of nature (pages 202â€“209). The warden occupies the space of a Gargantuan creature. When you Cast this Spell, you summon a warden depending on the biome in which the spell is cast (for instance, summoning the Warden of Caverns and Burrows if summoned in a cave, canyon, or other underground environment). In an unnatural environment, the warden summoned depends on the region's most recent or similar natural biome, as decided by the GM.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Warden of Caverns and Burrows</strong> Speed 60 feet, burrow 100 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong>(earth) <em>Obsidian Cage</em> Obsidian stalagmites burst from the earth as the warden surfaces, impaling enemies and trapping them in stalagmites. Enemies on the ground within 40 feet take @Damage[6d6[piercing]] damage (basic Reflex save). Creatures that fail their save become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] until they @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] (the DC is your spell DC); <strong>Depart</strong>(earth) <em>Blessing of the Depths </em>The squares occupied by the warden remain disheveled and broken, becoming difficult terrain. The warden affects you and all your allies within 60 feet with a mountain resilience and unfettered pack. The duration for both spells is reduced to 3 rounds, but the duration of mountain resilience isn't reduced when an affected target is hit by a bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing attack.</li>\n<li><strong>Warden of Forests and Meadows</strong> Speed 120 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong>(illusion, mental) <em>Idyllic Panorama</em> The warden's presence unpredictably warps the appearances and perceived distances of creatures and obstacles around it. Each time an enemy within 40 feet of the warden attempts a Strike or Stride action, it takes 4d6 mental damage (basic Will save). On a critical failure, the creature Strikes a random target within reach or Strides in a random direction. On a critical success, the creature becomes temporarily immune for 1 round; <strong>Depart</strong><em>Fox's Insightful Trickery </em>The warden affects you and all your allies within 60 feet with blur and truesight. The duration for both spells is reduced to 3 rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Warden of Oceans and Rivers</strong> Speed 60 feet, swim 120 feet; <strong>Arrive<em> </em></strong><em>I Am the Tide</em> If the warden is summoned in a body of water, it creates a churning whirlpool that deals @Damage[10d6[bludgeoning]] damage to all creatures within 30 feet (basic Reflex save). A creature that fails this save is pulled 15 feet closer to the warden (30 feet on a critical failure). If the warden is summoned outside of a body of water, it creates a wave of water that deals 8d6 bludgeoning damage to all creatures within 30 feet (basic Reflex save). A creature that fails this save is pushed 10 feet away from the warden; <strong>Depart</strong><em>Acclimation to the Deep</em> The warden affects you and your allies within 60 feet with feet to fins and water breathing. The duration for both spells is reduced to 3 rounds, but a creature affected by feet to fins retains its normal land Speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Warden of Peaks and Skies</strong> Speed 60 feet, fly 240 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong><em>Precipice Plummet</em> The warden appears, flying downward from the sky and sends a shockwave where she lands. Creatures within 20 feet take 10d6 sonic damage (basic Fortitude save). Creatures that critically fail their saves are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1}; <strong>Depart</strong>(auditory) <em>Song of the Skies</em> The warden affects you and all your allies within 60 feet with fly and unfettered movement. The duration for both spells is reduced to 3 rounds.\n\n</li>\n</ul>"
