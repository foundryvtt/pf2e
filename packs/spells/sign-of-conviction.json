This religious symbol is immobile, made of pure magical force, and can't be damaged. As long as you Sustain sign of conviction, you gain a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws and are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized]. The DC for any effect to force you to move out of your space (such as the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Shove] action) is equal to your spell DC or the normal DC, whichever is higher. If you stop being immobilized or are moved out of your space, <em>sign of conviction</em> immediately ends.</p>\n<p>When you Cast the Spell and each time you Sustain the Spell, the religious symbol emits a blast of energy at a target within 100 feet. Make a spell attack roll that deals 2d10 damage on a success (see below for determining damage type) and double damage on a critical success. You can Sustain the Spell multiple times in the same round to emit an array of blasts.</p>\n<p>If you worship a good deity, the spell gains the good and light traits, deals your choice of either fire or spirit damage, and emits bright light in a @Template[type:burst|distance:20]. If you worship an evil deity, the spell gains the evil and darkness traits, deals your choice of cold or spirit damage, and reduces the light level in a @Template[type:burst|distance:20] to dim light if it would be brighter. If you worship a neutral deity, the spell gains the force trait and deals force damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The damage increases by 1d10.</p>"
