The summoned kaiju occupies the space of a Gargantuan creature. When you Cast this Spell, choose one of the kaiju below to summon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agmazar the Star Titan</strong> Speed 100 feet, climb 50 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (necromancy, negative) <em>Channel Void</em> Each foe in a 100-foot emanation takes @Damage[16d8[void]] damage with a basic Fortitude save; <strong>Depart</strong> (transmutation) <em>Gravitic Repulsion</em> Each foe in a 50-foot emanation is pushed 100 feet away unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.</li>\n<li><strong>Agyra, the Forever Storm</strong> Speed 80 feet, fly 200 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (electricity, evocation) <em>Breath of a Thousand Storms</em> Agyra shoots two 1,200-foot lines of electricity, one from each of her heads. The lines can't overlap. Each creature along one of the lines takes @Damage[6d12[electricity]] damage with a basic Reflex save.

This potentially collapses structures with the collapse effect of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Earthquake]</em> spell, except there is no chance of falling into a fissure; <strong>Depart</strong> <em>Web Hurricane</em> Bezravnis departs with a hurricane of webbing. All creatures within a 50-foot emanation must succeed at a Reflex save or take a -20-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it Escapes (or is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] until it escapes on a critical failure). The Escape DC is your spell DC.</li>\n<li><strong>Mogaru, the Final King</strong> Speed 100 feet, swim 100 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (auditory, enchantment, mental) <em>Trance of the King's Melody</em> Mogaru manifests with a burst of the song that summoned him, requiring all foes within 60 feet who can hear him to attempt a Will save, leaving them @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 3} on a failure; <strong>Depart</strong> (evocation, fire) <em>Volcanic Breath</em> Mogaru unleashes his scorching breath in a 120-foot cone. Each creature in the area takes @Damage[10d6[fire]] damage with a basic Reflex save. On a failure, it also takes @Damage[4d6[persistent,fire]] damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Vorgozen, the Shapeless Feeder</strong> Speed 50 feet, climb 50 feet, swim 100 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (necromancy) <em>Pollute Magic</em> Vorgozen's foul presence pollutes magic around her. Each of your enemies within a 60-foot emanation that are under the effects of a spell must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 2}. Any of your enemies that Casts a Spell within 60 feet of Vorgozen must attempt a Fortitude save with the same effects unless it's already sickened; <strong>Depart</strong> (acid, evocation) <em>Beam of Purest Vitriol</em> Each creature in a 1,200-foot line takes @Damage[10d6[acid]] damage and @Damage[10d6[bludgeoning]] damage with a basic Fortitude save.</li>\n<li><strong>Yarthoon, the Moon Grub</strong> Speed 60 feet, burrow 100 feet, fly 100 feet, swim 100 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (cold, evocation) <em>Algid Beam Barrage</em> Yarthoon fires countless beams, targeting each of your enemies within 200 feet of it. The beams deal @Damage[10d6[cold]] damage with a basic Reflex save; <strong>Depart</strong> (cold, conjuration, water) <em>Frostbite Mist</em> Chilling mist surges out in a 100-foot burst centered on Yarthoon and remains for 1 minute. This mist has the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mist]</em>, plus any creature within the area at the end of its turn take @Damage[5d6[cold]] damage with a basic Fortitude save.</li>\n<li><strong>Ebeshra, the Winged Razor</strong> Speed 75 feet, fly 100 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (conjuration, teleportation) Planar Draw Each foe in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:100] is pulled 50 feet towards the center, unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.
