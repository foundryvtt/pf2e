Even though spell durations aren't normally exact, the effects of synchronize are precise to the second. The timer is based on the place where the spell was cast, so entering a plane or area where time flows differently changes how the time elapses.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (2nd)</strong> The spell can target up to 20 willing creatures.</p>"
