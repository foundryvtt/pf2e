If the wall would pass through a creature, the spell is lost. The wall sheds bright light for 20 feet on each side, and dim light for the next 20 feet. You can ignore the wall's effects.</p>\n<p>Roll [[/r 1d4]] to determine the color of the wall. Each color has a particular effect on items, effects, or creatures that attempt to pass through. <em>Chromatic wall</em> can't be counteracted normally; rather, each color is automatically counteracted when targeted by a specific spell, even if that spell's rank is lower than that of <em>chromatic wall</em>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Red</strong> The wall destroys ranged weapon ammunition (such as arrows and crossbow bolts) that would pass through, and it deals @Damage[20[fire]] damage to anyone passing through, with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.spellDC.value)|basic:true] save. <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Cone of Cold]</em> can counteract a <em>red chromatic wall</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Orange</strong> The wall destroys thrown weapons that would pass through, and it deals @Damage[25[acid]] damage to anyone passing through, with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.spellDC.value)|basic:true] save. <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Gust of Wind]</em> can counteract an <em>orange chromatic wall</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Yellow</strong> The wall stops acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, sonic, vitality, and void effects from passing through, and it deals @Damage[30[electricity]] damage to anyone passing through, with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.spellDC.value)|basic:true] save. <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Disintegrate]</em> can counteract a <em>yellow chromatic wall</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Green</strong> The wall stops toxins, gases, and breath weapons from passing through. It deals @Damage[10[poison]] damage to anyone passing through and makes them @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} for 1 minute. A @Check[type:fortitude|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.spellDC.value)|basic:true] save reduces the damage and negates the Enfeebled condition on a success. <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Magic Passage]</em> can counteract a <em>green chromatic wall</em>.<hr /></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> The spell's duration increases to 1 hour. Roll [[/r 1d8]] to determine the wall's color; the results for 5-8 are below. A @Damage[30[fire]]{red}, @Damage[35[acid]]{orange}, @Damage[40[electricity]]{yellow}, or @Damage[20[poison]]{green} wall deals an extra 10 damage.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Blue</strong> The wall stops auditory, petrification, sonic and visual effects from passing through, and creatures passing through are subject to the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Petrify]</em>. <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Force Barrage]</em> can counteract a <em>blue chromatic wall</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Indigo</strong> The wall stops divination and mental effects from passing through, and those passing through are subject to the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Warp Mind]</em>. <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Holy Light]</em> can counteract an <em>indigo chromatic wall</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Violet</strong> The wall prevents spells from targeting the other side (area effects still cross as normal). Creatures passing through must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.spellDC.value)] save or they are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 1} for 1 minute; on a critical failure, the creature is instead sent to another plane, with the effect of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Interplanar Teleport]</em>. <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Dispel Magic]</em> can counteract a <em>violet chromatic wall</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Reroll</strong>, and creatures that pass through the wall take a -2 circumstance penalty to their saves.</li>\n</ol>"
