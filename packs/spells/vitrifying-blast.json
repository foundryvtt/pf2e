The weakness is equal to 3 Ã— the slowed value it has from this spell. The target must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the creature's slowed value increases by 1 (or by 2 on a critical failure), to a maximum of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 3}. A successful save reduces the creature's slowed value by 1 (or by 2 on a critical success). If the creature ends its turn with a slowed value of 0, the effect ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target is initially @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 2}.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.Spell Effect: Vitrifying Blast]</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d6.</p>"
