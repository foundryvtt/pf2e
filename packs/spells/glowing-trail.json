You can Dismiss this spell at any time, but the path fades normally. The path can be visible or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Invisible]. While visible, it appears as a faintly glowing mist in a color of your choosing but sheds no light beyond its area. While invisible, you can still detect the path, but it gives off no light.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> The glowing trail fades after 1 day.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> The glowing trail fades after 1 week.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> The glowing trail fades after 1 month.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The glowing trail fades after 1 year.</p>"
