You gain an imprecise tremorsense, allowing you to sense anything directly touching plants within that distance. If you move, the hyphae snap, and the spell ends.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> You can control plants in the area to a small degree, allowing you to make Strikes with tree branches, exposed roots, or similarly solid plants. To do so, you use a Strike action, but you can Strike any creature you can detect with your tremorsense. These are spell attacks that deal @Damage[3d8[bludgeoning]] damage. Unusual plants, such as thorny vines, might deal a different type of damage at the GM's discretion. You can't make any other attacks through these plants, or take any other actions through them, other than these Strikes.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> As 4th rank, but you can use other simple manipulate actions through the plants, including having a branch pick an object up or open a door, though more complex actions, such as picking a lock or disabling a trap, remain impossible.</p>"
