A creature that fails this save is pushed 10 feet away from you.</p>\n<p>The wave explodes once it reaches the target, showering the target with earth and stone and dealing @Damage[12d10[bludgeoning]] damage with a basic Reflex save. A target that fails its save against this explosion is also pushed back 10 feet and knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone]. A creature subject to the explosion doesn't need to save against the tremors.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The wave explodes on one additional target of your choice in the line to the final target.</p>"
