If you fail to counteract the effect, you nevertheless set up a resonance that allows the target to more ably escape the effect on its own; for the next hour, the target gains a +2 status bonus to Will saves to shrug off the effect you failed to counteract (such as Will saves to shake off control by the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Possession] spell).</p>"
