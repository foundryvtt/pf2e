At the end of that creature's turn, if it's still grabbed by the vine, it takes @Damage[(floor(@item.level/2))d6[bludgeoning]] damage.</p>\n<p>The vine's Escape DC is equal to your spell DC. A creature can attack the vine in an attempt to break its grip. The vine's AC is equal to your spell DC, and the vine is destroyed if it takes 20 or more damage. Destroying or escaping from the vines ends the spell. You can Dismiss the spell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The initial bludgeoning damage increases by 1d6, the initial piercing damage increases by 1d8, and the damage a creature takes for ending its turn grabbed by the vine increases by 1d6.</p>"
