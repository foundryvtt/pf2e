You reduce the spell's level by 1, and targets of the spell gain a +2 status bonus to any saving throws, skill checks, AC, or DC against it. You can't reduce the spell's level below its minimum.</p>\n<p>For example, a 5th-level cone of cold would remain 5th-level, but a 5th-level fireball would become 4th-level. Targets still gain all the other benefits, even if you don't reduce the spell's level.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.Spell Effect: Arcane Countermeasure]</p>"
