This might require the target to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Interact] to retrieve an item or move to reach the nearest creature, and handing the item to the target always requires an Interact action.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the duration is 4 rounds, and the target must repeat the effects of failure on each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, the target can attempt a new Will save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round, ending it entirely on a critical success.</p>"
