This might require the target to Interact to retrieve an item or move to reach the nearest creature, and passing the item off requires an Interact action as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the duration is 4 rounds, and the target must repeat the effects of a failure on each of its turns.
