You can't target the same creature more than once, and you must have line of effect to all targets. Roll the damage only once, and apply it to each target (halving or doubling as appropriate for its saving throw outcome). The chain ends if any one of the targets critically succeeds at its save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d12.</p>"
