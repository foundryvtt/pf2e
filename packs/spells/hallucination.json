They also receive a Will save to disbelieve the hallucination every time they @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] or directly interact with the hallucination. For example, the target could attempt to disbelieve the hallucination each time they interacted with an elf, bumped into their brother accidentally, tried to check their charm, or studied the tower. The target can attempt to disbelieve with a large circumstance bonus in situations determined by the GM, such as if the target attempted to climb the nonexistent tower.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature perceives what you chose until it disbelieves, but it knows what the hallucination is.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature perceives what you chose until it disbelieves.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature perceives what you chose until it disbelieves, and it trusts its false senses, taking a -4 circumstance penalty to saves to disbelieve.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> Choose to either target up to 10 creatures or change the spellâ€™s duration to until your next daily preparations.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> Choose to either target any number of creatures or change the spell's duration to unlimited.</p>"
