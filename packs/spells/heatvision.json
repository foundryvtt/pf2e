This vision can detect any warm-blooded creature or source of heat not completely covered behind a solid object, such as a wall; this bypasses any concealment granted by smoke or darkness. It can similarly detect especially cold creatures and sources of cold. Almost all creatures with the cold or fire trait can be detected with heatvision. Undead and constructs are typically the same temperature as their environment and can't be detected with heatvision.
