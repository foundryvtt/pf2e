If it doesn't become a minion, you can give it one simple command that it pursues single-mindedly. If you aren't a follower of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.Norgorber], it ignores any of your subsequent commands. A follower of Norgorber can give the skinstitch simple commands by presenting a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Religious Symbol (Silver)]{Religious Symbol} of the deity and commanding it with a single action that has the auditory and concentrate traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, except a skinstitch that doesn't become your minion stays in place and attacks anyone that attacks or tries to move it, rather than following your command.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to create the skinstitch.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You create the skinstitch, but it goes berserk and attempts to kill you, ignoring your commands even if you are a follower of Norgorber.</p>"
