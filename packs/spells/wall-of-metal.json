Each 10-foot-by-10- foot section of the wall has AC 10 and is immune to critical hits and precision damage. The wall's Hardness, HP, and BT use the statistics of a structure of the material you chose. Creatures can move through a section of the wall that's broken.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> The wall is high-grade silver or standard-grade dawnsilver.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> The wall is standard-grade cold iron.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The wall is high-grade dawnsilver.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> The wall is high-grade cold iron or standard-grade adamantine.</p>"
