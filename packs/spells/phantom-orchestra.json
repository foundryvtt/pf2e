On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the Spell each round, you can move your conjured melody to a space within range (if needed) and create another explosion of music.</p>\n<p>Each explosion of sound from the phantom orchestra deals @Damage[8d6[sonic]] damage to all creatures in a @Template[type:burst|distance:10] (basic Fortitude save). The phantom orchestra doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by [[/r 1d6]].</p>"
