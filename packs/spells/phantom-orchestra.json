On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the Spell each round, you can move your conjured melody to a space within range (if needed) and create another explosion of music.</p>\n<p>Each explosion of sound from the <em>phantom orchestra</em> deals 8d6 sonic damage to all creatures in a 10-foot burst (basic Fortitude save). The <em>phantom orchestra</em> doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d6.</p>"
