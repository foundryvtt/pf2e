All other creatures and objects are invulnerable to your attacks, and you can't target or affect them with anything.</p>\n<p>Once you have finished your actions, time begins to flow again for the rest of the world. If you created an effect with a duration that extends beyond <em>freeze time'</em>s duration, such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wall of Fire], it immediately affects others again, but it doesn't have any of the effects that happen only when you first Cast the Spell.</p>"
