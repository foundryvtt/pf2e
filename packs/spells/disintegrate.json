A single casting can destroy no more than a 10-foot cube of matter. If you hit a creature, it takes 12d10 damage (no damage type) with a basic Fortitude save. If you critically hit, the target gets a result one degree of success worse than the outcome of its Fortitude save. A creature reduced to 0 HP is blasted to fine powder; its gear remains.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 2d10.</p>"
