While within 500 feet of the corpse (even if it's outside your line of sight or line of effect), you can see from where the target corpse had eyes using your normal visual senses, and you can hear from where the corpse had ears using your normal auditory senses. You can switch between your own vision and hearing, and the corpse's senses, with a single action that has the concentrate trait. If the corpse naturally lacked eyes or hearing organs in life, you cannot use that sense when using this spell. If the corpse is moved from its location, the spell ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> The duration increases to 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> The duration lasts until the next time you make your daily preparations.</p>"
