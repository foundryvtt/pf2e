When you cast restoration, choose to either reduce a condition or lessen the effect of a toxin. A creature can benefit from only one restoration spell each day, and it can't benefit from restoration more than once to reduce the stage of the same exposure to a given toxin.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lessen a Toxin</strong> Reduce the stage of one toxin the target suffers from by one stage. This can't reduce the stage below stage 1 or cure the affliction.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce a Condition</strong> Reduce the value of the target's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied] condition by 2. You can instead reduce two of the listed conditions by 1 each.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> Add @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained] to the list of conditions you can reduce. When you lessen a toxin, reduce the stage by two. You also gain a third option that allows you to reduce the target's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed] value by 1. You can't use this to reduce a permanent Doomed condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> As the 4th-rank restoration, but you can reduce a permanent Doomed condition if you add a spellcasting action and a material component while Casting the Spell, during which you provide 100 gp worth of diamond dust as a cost.</p>"
