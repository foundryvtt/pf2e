On a failed save, the slowed condition increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure) as stone growths creep across their body. A successful save reduces the slowed condition by 1. When a creature becomes fully unable to act due to the slowed condition from <em>petrify</em>, the spell then ends in a flash of gray light, leaving the target @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Petrified] permanently as they become a statue. The spell also ends if the slowed condition is removed, which causes the stone to break off harmlessly.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target is initially @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 2}.</p>"
