Between their thousand fractured reflections, the fluxwraith appearsâ€”a thing of broken glass, broken time and broken lives. This undead creature occupies the space of a Medium creature and has a fly Speed of 60 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Arrive</strong> (transmutation) <em>Interrupted Lives</em></p>\n<p>Each enemy within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] must attempt a Will save. If a creature fails its save, it is shunted into the future, vanishing now but automatically reappearing in the same location after [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}. A creature can attempt an additional Will save at the end of each of its turns to end the duration. If its original space is occupied when it returns, the creature appears in the nearest unoccupied space. Since the creature is shunted forward in time, it doesn't experience any of the intervening time. Likewise, any effects on the creature with a duration don't decrease their duration, resuming when the creature reappears.</p>\n<p><strong>Depart</strong> (divination, fear, mental, prediction) <em>Dire Foresight</em></p>\n<p>Each enemy within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:60] must attempt a Will save. On a failed save, the creature receives a brief vision of a deeply traumatic event in that lurks among the many possibilities of its future. The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 2} (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 4} on a critical failure) and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 1} while they are frightened.</p>"
