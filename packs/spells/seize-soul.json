If the item is destroyed or <em>seize soul</em> is counteracted on the item, the soul is freed. An item can't hold more than one soul, and any attempt wastes the spell.</p>\n<p>You can also target an item that has had a soul trapped it in with a second casting of <em>seize soul</em>, which destroys the item and either releases the soul or relocates it to a different item, whichever you choose.
