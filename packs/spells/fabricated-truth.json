If the statement changes what they perceive, they treat the change as a sudden revelation.</p>\n<p>The effect of the spell depends on the targets' Will saves. If a target is already subject to <em>fabricated truth</em>, your spell tries to counteract it. If the counteract check fails, the outcome of the target's saving throw can't be worse than a success.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target doesn't believe the statement, and it knows you tried to trick it.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target doesn't believe the statement or realize you tried to trick it.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target believes the statement for a duration of 1 week.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target believes the statement with unlimited duration.</p>"
