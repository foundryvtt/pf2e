As is the nature of mortal memory and stories, you are likely to learn multiple contradictory versions.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to learn any useful legends.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your mind becomes overwhelmed with the vast array of knowledge at your disposal. You can't sense or respond to anything in the present for 1 week except to perform necessities like breathing and sleeping. When you recover, however, you can retrain one of your skills into a Lore based on the knowledge of a subject you were accessing, as if you had spent 1 week retraining.</p>"
