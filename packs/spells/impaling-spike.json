The target must attempt a Reflex save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target dodges the spike and is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is struck by the spike and takes half damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is impaled through a leg or another nonvital body part. The creature takes full damage and, if it's standing on solid ground, becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized]. It can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] (the DC is your spell DC). While it remains impaled, it takes damage from any weakness to cold iron it has at the end of each of its turns.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature is impaled through a vital organ or its center of mass, taking double damage, and it is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] as long as it's impaled.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 2d6.</p>"
