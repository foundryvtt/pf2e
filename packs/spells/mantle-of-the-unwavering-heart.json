This effect has the healing and vitality traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Overwhelming Perfume</strong> (aura, olfactory) A cloud of potent floral scent surrounds you in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:15]. Creatures in the aura can't benefit from the scent ability and are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1} as long as they remain in the aura. The sickness is a disease effect.</li>\n<li><strong>Towering Trunk</strong> You grow to a considerable height. Increase your size to Large. You're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1}. Your reach increases by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if you started out Tiny), and you gain a grasping branch unarmed attack; this attack is in the brawling weapon group and deals @Damage[2d8[bludgeoning]] damage plus Grab.</li>\n<li><strong>Unyielding Will</strong> Your mind becomes incredibly resilient to change. You're immune to being @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fascinated], and you get a +1 bonus to saves and DCs against mental effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.Spell Effect: Mantle of the Unwavering Heart]</p>"
