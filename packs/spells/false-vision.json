You can Sustain the spell each round to change the illusion as you desire, including playing out a complex scene. If the scrying spell is of a higher rank than false vision, the scryer can attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the illusion, though even if they're successful, they can't learn what's truly going on in the area.</p>"
