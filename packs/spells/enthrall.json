It can attempt another Will save if it witnesses actions or speech with which it disagrees. If it succeeds, it's no longer fascinated and is temporarily immune for 1 hour. If the target is subject to a hostile act, or if another creature succeeds at a Diplomacy or Intimidation check against it, the fascination ends immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target can't attempt a save to end the fascination if it disagrees with you.</p>"
