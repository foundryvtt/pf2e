A creature that ends its turn in the area must also attempt this save, even if it's already grabbed or restrained by the snakes. You can Dismiss the spell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes full damage and is grabbed by a snake. The snakes' @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] DC is equal to your spell DC. A creature can attack a snake to release the creature. A snake's AC is equal to your spell DC, and it's destroyed if it takes 12 or more damage at once. New snakes continually regrow as long as the spell lasts, so destroying snakes doesn't prevent slither from capturing more creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature takes double damage and is restrained by a snake.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The persistent poison damage increases by 1d6 and snake HP increases by 6.</p>"
