These mirrors reflect the target, though if the target has no reflection, like a vampire, it's unaffected by <em>mirror malefactors</em>. As long as the target is surrounded by mirrors, it's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 1}, and it can't reduce its frightened value.</p>\n<p>When you Cast the Spell, the reflections leap from the mirrors and attack the target, dealing 7d8 mental damage with a basic Will save. On subsequent turns, this effect repeats the first time you Sustain the spell that turn. If the target succeeds at any Will save it attempts against <em>mirror malefactors</em>, the illusory mirrors shatter and the spell ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage for both the initial effect and on subsequent turns increases by 1d8.</p>"
