If the gem is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it shatters, immediately dealing 1d8 slashing damage (basic Reflex save) to the creature that destroyed it, as long as that creature is within 10 feet of the target.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The gem has 5 additional Hit Points, and the damage dealt by its detonation increases by 1d8.</p>"
