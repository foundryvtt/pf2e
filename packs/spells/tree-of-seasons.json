Four seedpods grow from the tree, each filled with the magic of a different one of the four seasons. A creature can Interact to pluck one of the pods, and can then either throw it up to 30 feet as part of the same action or do so with a separate Interact action later. When thrown, a pod explodes in a @Template[type:burst|distance:5], dealing 6d6 damage with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. The damage type depends on the season of the pod: electricity for spring, fire for summer, poison for autumn, or cold for winter. When the spell ends, the tree withers away and any remaining pods rot, leaving behind non-magical seeds.</p>\n<p>@Damage[(@item.level)d6[cold]]</p>\n<p>@Damage[(@item.level)d6[electricity]]</p>\n<p>@Damage[(@item.level)d6[fire]]</p>\n<p>@Damage[(@item.level)d6[poison]]</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The burst's damage increases by 1d6.</p>"
