These provide useful information for further inquiry but are generally incomplete or enigmatic. As is the nature of legends, you are likely to learn multiple contradictory versions.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to learn any useful legends.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your mind becomes lost in the past. You can't sense or respond to anything in the present for 1 week except to perform necessities like breathing and sleeping.
