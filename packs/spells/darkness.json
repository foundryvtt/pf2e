This also suppresses magical light of your darkness spell's rank or lower. Light can't pass through, so creatures in the area can't see outside. From outside, it appears as a globe of pure darkness.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> Even creatures with darkvision (but not greater darkvision) can barely see through the darkness.
