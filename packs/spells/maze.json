When the spell ends, either because the target escaped or the duration ran out, the target returns to the space it occupied when it was banished, or to the nearest space if the original is now filled.</p>\n<hr /><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target escapes and the spell ends.\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is on the right path to the exit.
