The cloud rains constantly on the target, keeping it wet and dampening the ground in the wake of any movement. The rain extinguishes non-magical flames. The target gains fire resistance 2. Creatures with weakness to water take damage equal to their weakness at the end of each of their turns. Creatures can attempt a Reflex save to avoid the cloud.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The amount of fire resistance increases by 2.</p>"
