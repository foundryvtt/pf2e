If hostile, such creatures choose to attack the target instead of other foes, if able to do so without spending additional actions or exposing themselves to additional danger.</p>\n<p>Verminous lure doesn't change animals' attitudes towards the target and is easily overridden by more direct control, such as the Command an Animal action. Animals with imprecise sense can use their scent as a precise sense against the target.</p>"
