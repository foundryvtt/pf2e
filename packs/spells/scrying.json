Instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet, you instead create an eye that manifests just above the target. You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its possessions or a piece of its body. If you haven't met the target in person, <em>scrying</em>'s DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware of the target's identity (perhaps because you found an unknown creature's fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower.</p>\n<p>The effect of <em>scrying </em>depends on the target's Will save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 week. The target also gains a glimpse of you and learns its rough distance and direction from you.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 day.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The spell succeeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The spell succeeds, and the eye follows the target if it moves, traveling up to 60 feet per round.</p>"
