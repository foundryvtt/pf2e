The targets appear at a distance from the intended destination equal to roughly 1 percent of the total distance traveled, in a direction determined by the GM. For short journeys, this lack of precision is irrelevant, but for long distances this could be up to 1 mile.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> You and the other targets can travel to any location within 1,000 miles.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> You and the other targets can travel to any location on the same planet.
