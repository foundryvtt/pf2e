This means you might find a type of object farther away if the nearest one is behind lead or running water.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> You can target a specific creature or ancestry instead of an object, but you must have met or seen up close the creature or ancestry you want to target.</p>"
