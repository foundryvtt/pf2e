Enemies in the area when you Cast the Spell take 6d8 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, with a @Check[type:reflex|basic:true|traits:illusion] or @Check[type:will|basic:true|traits:illusion] save, as shadows explode into being. You choose the damage type when you Cast the Spell, and each creature chooses the type of save it attempts before it rolls the save. The shadows then persist in the area for 1 minute, dealing [[/r 3d8]] damage of the type you chose to any enemy that ends its turn in the area. All creatures are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] to enemies in the area, as the illusory shadows swarm over them and block light.</p>\n<p>A creature that spends an action to Seek or otherwise interact with the shadow raid can attempt a Perception check to disbelieve it. On a success, the creature halves the damage it takes from the shadows, and the shadows no longer impede its vision. These benefits last until the spell ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The initial damage increases by 2d8, and the damage to a creature that ends its turn in the area increases by 1d8 ([[/r 4d8]]).</p>"
