The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fatigued] and can't reduce the value of this condition normally.</p>\n<p>You can detonate the mark at any point during its duration by Dismissing the spell. The rune explodes in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] centered on the target that deals @Damage[5d6[fire]] damage with a basic Reflex save. You choose whether the mark's target is included in the explosion.</p>\n<p>When you cast the spell, the target attempts a Fortitude save to determine how long the mark lasts. If the spell's duration elapses, the rune doesn't detonate.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The duration is 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The duration is 1 week.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The duration is unlimited.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by [[/r 2d6]].</p>"
