On a failed save, the slowed condition increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the slowed condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from lignify, the creature is permanently non-magically petrified, though it's turned to wood instead of stone. The spell ends if the creature is magically petrified or the slowed condition is removed.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target is initially @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 2}.</p>"
