The ritual speeds along any natural processes to make the brew, such as fermenting fruit to make a wine. At the conclusion of the first 3 hours of the ritual, you produce enough brew for up to 10 people to drink, any of whom can be the secondary caster of the ritual. The brew must then be consumed over the next hour. There is no danger of the drinkers becoming drunk if the brew is alcoholic. Once that hour is completed, you and the secondary caster attempt your checks as normal.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The brew is delicious and revitalizing. It casts a 4th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Cleanse Affliction], a 4th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Clear Mind], and a 4th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Sound Body] on each drinker for each relevant affliction or condition, using your modifier for the primary skill check as the counteract modifier.
