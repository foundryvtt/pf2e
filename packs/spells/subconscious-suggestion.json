The target must attempt a Will save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected and knows you tried to control it.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking to them normally, not casting a spell on them.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The suggestion remains in the target's subconscious until the next time you prepare. If the trigger occurs before then, the target immediately follows your suggestion. The effect has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> You can target up to 10 creatures.</p>"
