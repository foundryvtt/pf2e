An unwilling target can resist being moved with a successful Reflex save.</p>\n<p>The creatures move all at onceâ€”after you know the results of all the saves, you determine which target occupies each space in whatever order you choose. You can move a creature into a space that was previously occupied by another creature so long as you also relocate the first creature elsewhere as part of the movement. If you move a target into the air, it descends to the ground harmlessly after being moved unless it chooses not to.</p>\n<p>You can choose to be affected by an 8th-rank <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Magnetic Repulsion]</em> spell that lasts for the duration of <em>magnetic dominion</em>. Each time you Sustain the spell, you can move one creature in the emanation, with the same targeting restrictions and stipulations as above.</p>"
