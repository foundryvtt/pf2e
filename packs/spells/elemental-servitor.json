The secondary casters explain what sort of assistance you need and why you need it; if the task is incredibly fitting to the elemental lord, the GM can grant a circumstance bonus to the secondary Diplomacy check or rule that the check is automatically a critical success. If you use the ritual without good reason, the result is automatically a critical failure.</p>\n<p>If the ritual succeeds, you must offer the servitor payment depending on factors such as the duration and danger of the task. Payment always costs at least as much as a consumable item of the creature's level, and often costs as much as a permanent magic item of the creature's level to persuade a creature to fight alongside you. Your offerings should either align with the personal tastes of the elemental lord, or with the elementâ€”such as fresh flowers and bonsai plants for wood, or gemstones for earth.</p>\n<p>You can alternatively name a being native to an elemental plane that you know personally, with the same level restriction. Such a creature might request something they personally want as payment, such as a favor or a game of chance.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Your elemental lord sends a servitor, and the servitor's payment costs only half as much as normal. If you ask for a particular elemental creature by name, your lord is likely to send them unless the creature is busy.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Your elemental lord sends a servitor.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> Your elemental lord does not send a servitor.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your elemental lord is offended and sends a sign of displeasure or possibly even an elemental creature to scold or attack you, depending on your lord's nature.</p>"
