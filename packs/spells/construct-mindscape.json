It can have any appearance you and the secondary casters imagine and hold in your minds as you execute the ritual. A mindscape is typically veiled, disguising its nature as a mental construct, but you can choose to make it overt. Even a veiled mindscape has some signs it's not a real place that can be revealed through close inspection or by spending a long time there. Most mindscapes are incapable of physically harming those inside. Even though the mindscape you create is limited in dimension, it appears to have a convincing environment around it, such as a sky and clouds.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You create a mindscape approximately a half-mile in length and width, and 50 feet in height (large enough to contain a typical village). The GM might allow you to make it larger if it has little detail, such as a grassy plain. You and any secondary casters of your choice can enter it and you can leave a doorway that you and any creatures you designate can pass through.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the mindscape is approximately 25 feet in length, width, and height (like a modest house).</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You can't hold the image together and it falls apart.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your secret desires horribly warp the mindscape into a distorted mirror of what you intended.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> The duration is 1 week.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The duration is 1 year, and the area on a critical success is 1 mile in length and width.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> The duration is unlimited, and the area on a critical success is 1 mile in length and width.
