While one of your allies is in your champion's aura, the shields grant them a +1 status bonus to AC, and each time an enemy makes an attack against the ally, the enemy takes 1d4 spirit damage (even if it misses).</p>\n<p>The benefit applies only while an ally is in your aura, ending for any ally that leaves and applying to any that enters later.
