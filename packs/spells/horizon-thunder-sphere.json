On a critical success, the target takes double damage and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] for 1 round. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines the range and other parameters.</p>\n<p><span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> This spell has a range of 30 feet.</p>\n<p><span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> This spell has a range of 60 feet and deals half damage on a failure (but not a critical failure) as the electricity lashes out and jolts the target.</p>\n<p><strong>Two Rounds</strong> If you spend 3 actions Casting the Spell, you can avoid finishing the spell and spend another 3 actions on your next turn to empower the spell even further. If you do, after attacking the target, whether you hit or miss, the ball of lightning explodes, dealing @Damage[(@item.rank*2)d6[electricity]] damage to all other creatures in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] around the target (basic Reflex save). Additionally, you spark with electricity for 1 minute, dealing @Damage[(@item.rank)[electricity]] damage to creatures that Grab you or that hit you with an unarmed Strike or a non-reach melee weapon.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The initial damage on a hit, as well as the burst damage for two-round casting time, each increase by 2d6, and the damage creatures take if they Grapple or hit you while you're in your sparking state increases by 1.</p>"
