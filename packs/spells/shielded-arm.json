It can Shield Block with its Raised arm as well; when it does, the target reduces the damage as if it had a shield with Hardness 4 and 15 Hit Points. This shield doesn't have a Broken Threshold, and the spell ends if the shield's Hit Points are expended.</p>\n<p>This spell doesn't modify the target's unarmed attacks and can't be used to make a shield bash Strike.
