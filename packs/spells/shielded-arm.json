It can use the Raise a Shield action to instead raise its arm, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to AC. It can Shield Block with its Raised arm as well; when it does, the target reduces the damage as if it had a shield with Hardness 4 and 15 Hit Points. This shield doesn't have a Broken Threshold, and the spell ends if the shield's Hit Points are expended.</p>\n<p>This spell doesn't modify the target's unarmed attacks and can't be used to make a shield bash Strike. Casting or coming under the effects of this spell also counts as using a metallic item with regards to anathema.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The Hardness increases by 4, and the Hit Points increase by 15.</p>"
