While in this form, you gain the plant trait. You can Dismiss the spell.</p>\n<p>You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AC = 19 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.</li>\n<li>12 temporary Hit Points.</li>\n<li>Resistance 10 to poison.</li>\n<li>Low-light vision.</li>\n<li>One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +17, and your damage bonus is +11. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled] condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.</li>\n<li>Athletics modifier of +19, unless your own modifier is higher.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You also gain specific abilities based on the type of plant you choose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.Spell Effect: Plant Form (Arboreal)]{Arboreal}</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Speed 30 feet</li>\n<li><strong>Melee</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> branch (reach 15 feet), <strong>Damage</strong> 2d10 bludgeoning;</li>\n<li><strong>Melee</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> foot, <strong>Damage</strong> 2d8 bludgeoning;</li>\n<li>you can speak in this form</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.Spell Effect: Plant Form (Flytrap)]{Flytrap}</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Speed 15 feet; resistance 10 to acid;</li>\n<li><strong>Melee</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> leaf (reach 10 feet), <strong>Damage</strong> 2d8 piercing, and you can spend an action after a hit to Grab the target.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> Your battle form is Huge, and the reach of your attacks increases by 5 feet.
