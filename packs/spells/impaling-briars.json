The first time you Sustain this Spell each round, you can select one of the following effects to occur in the area.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ensnare</strong> The briars clump around your foes, attempting to hold them in place. A foe within the area (or flying at most 20 feet above the area) must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, it takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to all Speeds for 1 round, and on a critical failure, it is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] for 1 round unless it Escapes.</li>\n<li><strong>Impede</strong> The briars twist and writhe, making the entire area difficult terrain.</li>\n<li><strong>Wall</strong> A wall of thorns appears in the area, lasting for 1 round. The wall is greater difficult terrain instead of difficult terrain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, once per round you can direct the briars to impale any target in the area (or flying up to 20 feet above the area) that you can see by using a single action, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits. Make a spell attack roll. On a success, the target takes 10d6 piercing damage and takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to all Speeds for 1 round; on a critical success, the target is Immobilized for 1 round unless it Escapes.</p>"
