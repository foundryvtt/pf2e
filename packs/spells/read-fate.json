Fate is notoriously inscrutable, and the word isn't necessarily meant to be taken at face value, so the meaning is often clear only in hindsight. The GM rolls a secret @Check[type:flat|dc:6|traits:secret]. If the creature's fate is too uncertain, or on a failed flat check, the spell yields the word \"inconclusive.\" Either way, the creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>"
