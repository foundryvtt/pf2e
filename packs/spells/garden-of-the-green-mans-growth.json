Creatures that fail this save are pushed 30 feet away from the green man and are knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone]. The area becomes greater difficult terrain for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Depart</strong> (plant) <em>Forest of Grasping Vines</em> The green man casts out their arms, causing vines to rise from the ground, lash at up to six different creatures, and coil them up. Each of these vines targets a different enemy within 100 feet of the green man and deals @Damage[12d6[slashing]] damage with a basic Reflex save. A creature that fails is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Grabbed] until it Escapes (on a critical failure it is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Restrained] until it Escapes). The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] DC is your spell DC. Each creature that begins its turn grabbed or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] by these vines takes an additional @Damage[4d6[bludgeoning]] damage, as the vines continue to squeeze the life from it.</p>"
