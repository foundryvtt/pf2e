Each time a creature in the area speaks a true statement, the soft ring of a bell sounds in the area. Creatures are aware of the magic; therefore, they can avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they can be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. If a creature is in the area when the spell is cast or later enters the area, that creature attempts a Will save. It uses the results of this initial save if it leaves and reenters the area.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is so convincing that the bell rings even if they lie.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> If the target lies and succeeds at their Deception check against all targets, the bell still rings.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The bell accurately sees through their deception and will never ring if they lie</p>"
