The parade is lively and noisy, providing enough cover and distraction to hide among the crowd. Creatures can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Hide] inside the crowd, though creatures that disbelieve the illusion still see creatures within as normal. You are automatically @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] among the parade as it always follows you. Creatures attempting to locate you must succeed at a Perception check against your spell DC, though you can actively choose to Hide if you prefer to use Stealth instead.</p>\n<p>You can choose to send the parade off with a 2-action activity, which has the concentrate trait. When you do so, the parade no longer follows you and instead continues traveling in the direction of your choice. The parade travels 100 feet over 1 round and then disappears as the spell is Dismissed. You can otherwise Dismiss the spell normally if you prefer.</p>"
