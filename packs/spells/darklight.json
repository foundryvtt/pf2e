The spell similarly suppresses magical light of the spell's rank or lower.</p>\n<p>Light can't pass through, so creatures in the area can't see outside. Even creatures with darkvision (but not greater darkvision) can barely see through the darkness; any creatures seen through the darkness are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] to them. Creatures with greater darkvision can see through the darkness normally.</p>\n<p>Creatures who move into the field or start their turn within the field have some of the life and light sucked out of them, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 void damage, with a basic Fortitude save.</p>\n<p>When you cast this spell, choose up to four allies in the area to spare from <em>darklight's</em> effects. Until the spell ends, they're immune to damage from <em>darklight</em> spells and can see through <em>darklight</em> (but not other darkness) as though they had greater darkvision.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> The bludgeoning and void damage both increase to 3d6.</p>"
