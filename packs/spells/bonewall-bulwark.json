The bulwark is 10 feet high, 10 feet long, and 1 foot thick. The bulwark has an AC of 10 and 30 Hit Points. You must create the bulwark in an unbroken open space so it doesn't pass through any creatures or objects, or the bulwark's dimensions are reduced to fit the smaller space. It must pass within 5 feet of you.</p>\n<p>The <em>bonewall bulwark</em> grants cover from creatures on the opposite side. At the beginning of your turn, you may have the limbs attack a single creature you're aware of within 5 feet of the wall using your spell attack modifier and dealing 3d10 bludgeoning damage. This ignores cover and concealment provided by the <em>bonewall bulwark</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d10 and the HP of the wall increases by 10.</p>"
