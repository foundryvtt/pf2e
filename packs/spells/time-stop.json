All other creatures and objects are invulnerable to your attacks, and you can't target or affect them with anything.</p>\n<p>Once you have finished your actions, time begins to flow again for the rest of the world. If you created an effect with a duration that extends beyond the time stop's duration, such as wall of fire, it immediately affects others again, but it doesn't have any of the effects that happen only when you first cast the spell.</p>"
