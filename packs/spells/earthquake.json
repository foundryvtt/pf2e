The fissures are permanent, and their sides require successful @Check[type:athletics|dc:15|traits:action:climb] to Climb.</li>\n<li><strong>Collapse Structures</strong> and ceilings might collapse. The GM rolls a flat check for each (@Check[type:flat|dc:16] for a sturdy structure, @Check[type:flat|dc:14] for an average structure and most natural formations, @Check[type:flat|dc:9] for a shoddy structure, all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature caught in it with a basic Reflex save. A creature falls @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone] unless it critically succeeds and falls into a fissure if it critically fails.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> You create a massive earthquake that can devastate a settlement.
