The appearance of the illusion that disguises you includes any changes to sex characteristics or other aspects needed to match the target creature's heart's desire, allowing you to interact with them as the person they could be. If you're ever more than 30 feet from the subject you're reflecting, <em>reflected beauty</em> immediately ends. You can Dismiss this spell.</p>"
