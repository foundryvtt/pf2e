Whenever it uses an action that has the auditory trait or attempts to Cast a Spell that doesn't have the subtle trait, it must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] or the action is lost. Once per round, the target can spend an Interact action to massage its throat, attempting a Fortitude save against your spell DC. On a success, the spell ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but using an action with the auditory trait also deals 2d10 mental damage to the target as the sound of its distorted voice grates on its ears.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the damage for using an action with the auditory trait is doubled, and the target can't use an Interact action to attempt a Fortitude save to end the effect early.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage for using an action with the auditory trait increases by 1d10.</p>"
