You can immediately attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] an undetected creature, and you gain a +1 status bonus to this attempt and any of your other attempts to Seek @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] or undetected creatures until the end of your next turn. You also learn if any such creatures passed through this area in the last hour, although you get only the vaguest sense of direction from the spell. If you begin to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Track] a creature detected in this way, you gain a +1 status bonus to the initial check.</p>"
