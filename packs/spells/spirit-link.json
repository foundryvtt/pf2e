You lose as many Hit Points as the target regained.</p>\n<p>This is a spiritual transfer, so no effects apply that would increase the Hit Points the target regains or decrease the Hit Points you lose. This transfer also ignores any temporary Hit Points you or the target have. Since this effect doesn't involve vitality or void energy, <em>spirit link</em> works even if you or the target is undead. While the duration persists, you gain no benefit from regeneration or fast healing. You can Dismiss this spell, and if you're ever at 0 Hit Points, <em>spirit link </em>ends automatically.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The number of Hit Points transferred each time increases by 2.</p>"
