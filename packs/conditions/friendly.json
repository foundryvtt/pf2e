A creature that is friendly to a character likes that character. It is likely to agree to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Request]{Requests} from that character as long as they are simple, safe, and don't cost too much to fulfill. If the character (or one of their allies) uses hostile actions against the creature, the creature gains a worse attitude condition depending on the severity of the hostile action, as determined by the GM.</p>"
