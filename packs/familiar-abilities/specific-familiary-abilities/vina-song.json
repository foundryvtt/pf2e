Each creature within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30] must attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fascinated] for 1 round. A kinnar can use this ability again on the next round to continue the song and force affected creatures to attempt another Will save; on a failure, a creature is fascinated for an additional round. Once the kinnar stops playing, they can't use this ability again for 1 hour. A creature that succeeds at any save or has its fascination broken is temporarily immune to that kinnar's Vina Song for 24 hours. Kinnars are immune to this ability.</p>"
