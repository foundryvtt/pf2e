While they're two beings, they're still considered a single creature, act as a single creature, use normal familiar statistics, and are subject to all of the normal effects that come with being a single creature. Their linked spirits allow them to stave off attacks against their mind. If your kinnars are subjected to a mental effect that allows a saving throw, they roll twice and take the higher result; this is a fortune effect.</p>"
