When you Cast or Sustain a hex, your familiar can curse a creature within 15 feet of it, prolonging the duration of any negative conditions affecting it by 1 round. This is a curse effect. This prolongs only conditions with a timed duration (such as \"1 round\" or \"until the end of your next turn\") and doesn't prevent conditions from being removed by other means.</p>"
