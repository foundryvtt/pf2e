When transformed, the familiar can't act except to turn back into a familiar. It isn't affected by area effects and must be targeted separately to affect it, which requires knowledge that it's a creature.</p>\n<p>This means you and your allies can heal or assist the familiar while most enemies stay unaware of its true nature. Creatures must attempt a @Check[type:perception|dc:20] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] to realize a it is actually a familiar. Your familiar can still communicate its feelings empathically. Transforming the familiar between forms is a 1-minute activity that has the concentrate trait.</p>"
