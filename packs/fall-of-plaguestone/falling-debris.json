For the creature in the center square, where the trap is triggered, this is a basic save. Creatures in the two adjacent squares take no damage on a success or critical success as they avoid the falling debris entirely, but take full damage on a failed save, and take double damage on a critical failure. Creatures that take damage from the debris are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized], trapped under the crushing weight.</p>\n<p>Clearing out a square of debris requires a successful @Check[type:athletics|dc:17|name:Clear Debris] skill check, with the following effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The square is cleared in 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The square is cleared in 5 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The square is cleared in 10 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The ceiling above the square collapses further, dealing an additional @Damage[2d6[bludgeoning]] damage to the character digging out the square and any character trapped in that square.
