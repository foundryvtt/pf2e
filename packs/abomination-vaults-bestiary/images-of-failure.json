A creature that takes damage hears a soft whisper offering, “Let me take something from you and I can stop the pain.” A creature who agrees loses access to a random skill feat that isn't a prerequisite for another feat, and the creature doesn't take further damage from Echoes of Defeat. This effect lasts for 1 week and can be ended by effects that remove curses.</p>"
