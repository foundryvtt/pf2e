You designate the destination of the teleportation as part of the ritual. This destination can't be changed. The destination must be a location within 1,000 miles and be on the same plane as the teleportation circle. You must be able to identify the location precisely both by its position relative to the location where you create the teleportation circle and by the destination's appearance (or other identifying features). The destination must also be a 10-foot-diameter circle that doesn't overlap with any solid structures, but it can be a place that is harmful or dangerous.</p>\n<p>A secondary caster attempting a Survival check for this ritual can be located at the exact site of the destination, instead of with you at the point of origin. If the secondary succeeds at their check at the destination and you roll a success, the ritual is a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>While the circle is active, any creature that moves to be fully within the circle is instantly teleported to the destination. A creature that is unwilling to be teleported can attempt a Will save to resist the effect. If it remains in the circle, the creature must attempt this save again at the end of each of its turns.</p>\n<p>The teleportation circle normally goes only in one direction, though you can double the Cost to make the teleportation work in both directions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You create the teleportation circle, and it's extremely precise, regardless of the distance traveled. Travelers arrive exactly at the designated point.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As a critical success, but the destination of the teleportation circle is slightly inaccurate, and is off target by roughly 1 percent of the distance traveled, to a maximum of 10 miles off target.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The teleportation circle doesn't function.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The teleportation circle is wildly inaccurate.

The secondary caster attempting the Crafting check creates a warding diagram to prevent the extraplanar creature from attacking or leaving during the bargain; if that caster fails or critically fails, then instead of the usual effects of a failure or critical failure of the secondary skill check, the extraplanar creature can attack or leave instead of negotiate. You can also leave out this step, removing the need for a Crafting check, with the same result (if you're summoning a good extraplanar creature you trust, for example). The creature can also attack or leave if you use any hostile action against it or if the warding diagram breaks. Once the diagram is complete, you and the secondary casters each take your places at specific points at the diagram's edge where power concentrates.</p>\n<p>You conjure the extraplanar creature within your wards and negotiate a deal with it, generally to perform a task for you in exchange for payment. A creature that doesn't wish to negotiate at all can attempt a Will save to stay on its home plane. Most good and neutral extraplanar creatures feel that they have something better to do than cater to the whims of mortals and require a significant gift, especially if your task poses significant risks. Evil extraplanar creatures are more likely to accept a bargain for a lower cost as long as it allows them to wreak havoc on the Material Plane or inflict evil upon the world along the way. Monetary prices usually range from the cost of a consumable item of the creature's level for a short and simple task to a permanent magic item of the creature's level or more to persuade the creature to fight alongside you. However, some extraplanar creatures may want payments other than money, such as permission to cast a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Geas]</em> on you to fulfill an unspecified later favor or obtain ownership of your soul via an infernal contract. If you can't come to an agreement in a reasonable length of time after you've made your case, the extraplanar creature can return from whence it came at any time.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You call the extraplanar creature and bind it in the wards for up to a full day before it returns home, potentially allowing you to negotiate a better deal by threatening to leave it in the wards for the full day.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You call the extraplanar creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to call the extraplanar creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You call something dark and horrible, unbound by your wards, and it immediately attempts to destroy you.</p>"

These elements generate appropriate sounds and smells, and they feel right to the touch. Elements of an illusory scene are incapable of speech. Unlike with the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Illusory Creature]</em> spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Hallucinatory Terrain]</em> spell.</p>\n<p>When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches any part of the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. If they interact with a portion of the illusion, they disbelieve only that portion. They disbelieve the entire scene only on a critical success.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> Creatures or objects in your scene can speak. You must speak the specific lines for each actor when creating your program.

            "privateNotes": "<p>During their trek through the lowest levels of the Abomination Vaults, the heroes likely face Belcorra several times before they finally acquire the <em>fulcrum lenses</em> they need to defeat her for good. She learns about them from her wisp allies and you can thereafter use her whenever her appearance might cause the most tension. She should attack at least once on each dungeon level, as often as every couple of days. You shouldn't have Belcorra fight alongside other creatures until the adventure's finale-she's tough enough on her own!</p>\n<p>Each time Belcorra attacks, she learns more about how the heroes fight and adapts her tactics and her preparations. She might cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Spell Immunity]</em> to protect herself from the heroes' most effective spells, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.True Seeing]</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.See Invisibility]</em> to keep them in sight, or <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Dispel Magic]</em> to counter their magical defenses. She mocks the heroes for their failures and rages at their successes-remember, she has been aware of them since her test firing of <em>Gauntlight's</em> beam in \"Ruins of Gauntlight.\"</p>\n<p><strong>First Attack</strong> As soon as Belcorra realizes the heroes' presence, she seeks them out, traveling through the <em>Gauntlight</em> footprint (areas <strong>A37</strong> and <strong>B28</strong>). She casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Phantasmal Calamity]</em> at a distance and retreats, moving through walls if necessary so the heroes can't follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Second Attack</strong> Belcorra wants the heroes to fear her, so she approaches them more closely the second time and uses single-target spells like <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Feeblemind]</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Phantasmal Killer]</em> while demanding the heroes flee her Abomination Vaults. With her message delivered, she retreats after only a few rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Later Attacks</strong> Once the heroes have recovered a <em>fulcrum lens</em> or the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Fulcrum Lattice]</em>, Belcorra considers the heroes an actual threat, but her anger overrides her caution. She attacks with her full might, using her Corrupting Gaze and ghostly hand along with her spells. If she defeats a hero, she retreats, confident that they'll leave her alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Leveraging Agents</strong> Belcorra has several living allies within the Abomination Vaults, including the urdefhan cult and the Children of Belcorra. She might send these groups after the heroes, insisting they let the heroes know they're acting on Belcorra's orders. Fortunately, neither group can muster large numbers, so the heroes should be able to manage an attack from them.</p>\n<p><strong>Killing Allies</strong> Belcorra learns if the heroes make alliances, such as with nearby calignis or drow. She knows better than to face powerful, entrenched leaders like Galudu or Quara, but she might murder a few guards or direct monsters where they can most damage the heroes' allies. It's important to Belcorra that she leave some evidence (usually a single, injured survivor) to let the heroes know she had orchestrated the attack.</p>\n<p><strong>In the Footprint</strong> Belcorra is most effective fighting the heroes who enter the <em>Gauntlight</em> footprint (areas <strong>A37</strong> and <strong>B28</strong>) due to her Haunted Lighthouse ability.</p>\n<p><strong>The Final Attack</strong> If the heroes defeat Belcorra shortly before they reach the Empty Vault, she uses the power of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Ebon Fulcrum Lens]</em> to hasten her rejuvenation so she can face them in her sanctum. Belcorra doesn't ever surrender or flee in the Empty Vault. The heroes could possibly face her there without yet having the ability to permanently defeat her. In this case, they'll need to retreat to collect the <em>fulcrum lenses</em> and return to face her again. Once the heroes can focus Nhimbaloth's gaze upon Belcorra, they can defeat the sorcerer for good.</p>",
