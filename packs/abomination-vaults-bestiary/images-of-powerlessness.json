A creature that takes damage hears a soft whisper offering, “Let me take something from you and I can stop the pain.” A creature who agrees loses access to a random class feat that isn't a prerequisite for another feat, and the creature doesn't take further damage from Flood of Despair. This effect lasts for 1 week and can be ended by effects that remove curses. The creature also immediately detects the secret door at the end of the hall, no matter how far away from the end of the hall they are.</p>"
