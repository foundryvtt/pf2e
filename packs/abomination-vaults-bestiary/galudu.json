Both the duplicate and your invisibility persist for the spell's duration. Performing a hostile action doesn't end mislead's invisibility, just like a 4th-rank invisibility spell.

This doesn't fool anyone who's aware your duplicate is an illusion, nor does it work if the attack obviously couldn't have come from the duplicate. For instance, if you fired a ray, you could make it look like it came from the duplicate as long as the duplicate was positioned appropriately, but if you attacked with a sword and your duplicate was across the room from the target, your Deception check would automatically fail.</p>"

The stored spell must take 3 actions or fewer to cast, have a hostile effect, and target one creature or have an area. You can set a password, a trigger, or both for the glyph. Any creature that moves, opens, or touches the target container or enters the target area that doesn't speak the password or that matches the trigger activates the glyph, releasing the harmful spell within.</p>\n<p>Once a spell is stored in the glyph, the glyph gains all the traits of that spell. If the stored spell targets one or more creatures, it targets the creature that set off the glyph. If it has an area, that area is centered on the creature that set off the glyph. Glyph of warding's duration ends when the glyph is triggered. The glyph counts as a magical trap, using your spell DC for both the Perception check to notice it and the Thievery check to disable it; both checks require the creature attempting them to be trained in order to succeed.</p>\n<p>You can Dismiss glyph of warding.

The shield has Hardness 5. After you use Shield Block, the spell ends and you can't cast it again for 10 minutes. Unlike a normal Shield Block, you can use the spell's reaction against the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Force Barrage] spell.</p>\n<p>Heightening the spell increases the shield's Hardness.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.Spell Effect: Shield]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.Effect: Shield Immunity]</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> The shield has Hardness 10.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> The shield has Hardness 15.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> The shield has Hardness 20.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The shield has Hardness 25.</p>"
