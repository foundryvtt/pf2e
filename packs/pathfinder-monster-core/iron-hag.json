These elements generate appropriate sounds and smells, and they feel right to the touch. Elements of an illusory scene are incapable of speech. Unlike with the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Illusory Creature] spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mirage] spell.</p>\n<p>When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches any part of the image or uses the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. If they interact with a portion of the illusion, they disbelieve only that portion. They disbelieve the entire scene only on a critical success.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> Creatures or objects in your scene can speak.

They most often snatch babies from their cradles, though they sometimes target fearful children or youths who suffer from anxiety. They then imprison their new wards in towers or enchanted dungeons, terrifying their victims with stories of the outside world to discourage them from even trying to escape. If these methods fail to be effective, iron hags become more straightforward in their methods of imprisonment, insisting it's for their captives' own good.</p>\n<p>An iron hag's true form has unnaturally long arms. True to their name, they have teeth made of iron, as well as long iron toenails and claws.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Hags are malevolent predators who use magic and manipulation to lure children and young adults into their clutches. Though their true forms are eldritch and horrifying, hags spend much of their lives disguised as ordinary women. They seek out targets who are unhappy, innocent, or otherwise vulnerable, preying on their weaknesses before snatching them up. The typical hag is abusive, controlling, and narcissistic. Though less malicious hags possibly exist, they rarely reveal their true forms, making them nearly impossible to find.</p>",
