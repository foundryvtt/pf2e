The more damage the corpse has taken, the more inaccurate or patchwork its answers are, and it must have a throat and mouth to speak at all. If anyone has previously cast this spell on the corpse in the last week, the spell automatically fails. The corpse can attempt a Will save to resist answering the questions using the statistics of the original creature at its time of death, with the following effects.</p>\n<hr /><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target can lie or refuse to answer your questions, and the target's spirit haunts you for 24 hours, bothering you and causing you to be unable to gain any rest for that time.\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target can provide false information or refuse to answer your questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target must answer truthfully, but its answers can be brief, cryptic, and repetitive. It can still mislead you or attempt to stall so that the spell's duration runs out before you can ask all your questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target's answers are more direct and less repetitive, though still cryptic.

These hags then weave magical, idealized worlds out of illusions and dream stuff to trap their victims. Once they convince a mortal to stay in their magical world forever, the cuckoo hag drains their prey of life force and imprisons their soul.</p>\n<p>A cuckoo hag's true form is a creature with the cracked pale skin of a broken porcelain doll and an almost impossibly thin neck and limbs.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Hags are malevolent predators who use magic and manipulation to lure children and young adults into their clutches. Though their true forms are eldritch and horrifying, hags spend much of their lives disguised as ordinary women. They seek out targets who are unhappy, innocent, or otherwise vulnerable, preying on their weaknesses before snatching them up. The typical hag is abusive, controlling, and narcissistic. Though less malicious hags possibly exist, they rarely reveal their true forms, making them nearly impossible to find.</p>",
