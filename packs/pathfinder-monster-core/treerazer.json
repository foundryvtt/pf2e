For now, even as a nascent demon lord, Treerazer is a dangerous foe.</p>\n<p>Treerazer rarely leaves his swampy realm of Tanglebriar-a large thicket of tainted foliage and rotting detritus just south of Kyonin's Fierani Forest-but can be encountered anywhere within that toxic mire, often accompanied by a small legion of demons, corrupted fey, and other deadly allies. Certain occult rituals have the power to call him forth from Tanglebriar, granting him the opportunity to directly work his evils beyond the realm to which he has been exiled. Some believe that no eldritch force contains Treerazer and that, were he willing, he could travel Golarion with impunity, spreading the twisted blessings of his touch and the corruption of his presence, yet the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is as cunning and canny as he is deadly, and prefers to work his evils on the world from the safety of his nightmare realm.</p>",
