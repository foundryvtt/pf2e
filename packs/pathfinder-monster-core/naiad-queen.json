The most common of their kind are the dryads, which are spirits that embody great trees, but many other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, typically a specific tree or pond, or even-in the case of nymph queens-whole forests or massive bodies of water</p>\n<h2>Nymph Queens</h2>\n<p>Nymph queens are powerful nymphs who rule over entire regions of untouched wilderness, not just single trees or ponds.
