They prefer using indirect methods to dissuade those who would harm their sacred groves and beloved forests, but they are not above using enchantments to enlist the aid of allies when evil threats cannot be dissuaded with words alone. In times of peace, dryads happily live secluded lives inside their trees, and a community at harmony with nature might not even realize a dryad lives nearby.</p>\n<p>Though they watch over all the woods around them, dryads are inextricably tied to a specific tree, usually an oak. Dryads who are bonded to another type of tree are fundamentally the same, but they may differ in temperament and appearance to match their ward. For instance, kraneiai, or cherry-tree dryads, have beautiful pink coloration and concern themselves with the fragile beauty of life.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Nymphs are a family of fey that take the form of beautiful humanoids with elven features and have a deep association with the natural world. The most common of their kind are the dryads, which are spirits that embody great trees, but many other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, typically a specific tree or pond, or even-in the case of nymph queens-whole forests or massive bodies of water</p>",
