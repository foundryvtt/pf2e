The flower that droops from the tip of this stalk is usually white, but for the 24 hours after the nettle feeds, the flower's petals turn blood red.</p>\n<p>Due to their affinity with undead, vampire nettles are often found in abandoned burial grounds. Nettles that grow above graves sometimes send roots deep into the ground to suck additional nutrients from the bodies buried below; these vampire nettles often have the elite monster adjustments.</p><h2>Vampire Admirers</h2><p>Many vampires are fond of vampire nettles and are unaffected by the plant's intoxicating scent.
