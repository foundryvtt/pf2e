This room is outfitted with all the accoutrements for a particular type of recreation, determined by you when you cast the spell. Any character who spends at least 1 hour using this recreational facility and then sleeps a full 8 hours inside the location created by the spell is exceptionally well-rested. They regain double the amount of Hit Points they would normally receive for an 8-hour rest, and when they make the next day's preparations, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks and Will saves for the next 12 hours.</p>"
