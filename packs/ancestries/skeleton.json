However, the animated bones of dragons, giants, and other great beasts make for dangerous foes. Powerful living creatures can retain some of their might and intellect upon returning as a skeleton. Some necromancers turn their strongest enemies into skeletal undead servants, assuming they can keep control of them.</em></p>\n<p><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.45SK8rdbbxvEHfMn.JournalEntryPage.EcNSrvwIj22Jxkjz]{Skeleton}</em></p>"
