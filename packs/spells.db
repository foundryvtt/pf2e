This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.</p>\n<p>Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeted Effects.</strong> Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Magic.</strong> The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Spells.</strong> Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic Items.</strong> The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p>\n<p>A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical Travel.</strong> Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.</p>\n<p><strong>Creatures and Objects.</strong> A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.</p>\n<p><strong>Dispel Magic.</strong> Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere.

Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p>\n<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to Physical Characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect Aberrations or drow), or Alignment. You can also set Conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>\n<p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.</p>\n<p><strong>Explosive Runes</strong>. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. The Sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Glyph</strong>. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it Targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful Objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and Attack it. If the spell requires Concentration, it lasts until the end of its full Duration.</p>\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.</p>"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source","value":"PHB pg. 245"},"spellType":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Type","value":"attack"},"level":{"type":"Number","label":"Spell Level","value":3},"school":{"type":"String","label":"Spell School","value":"abj"},"components":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Components","value":"V, S, M"},"materials":{"type":"String","label":"Materials","value":"Incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200gp, which the spell consumes"},"target":{"type":"String","label":"Target","value":""},"range":{"type":"String","label":"Range","value":"Touch"},"time":{"type":"String","label":"Casting Time","value":"1 Hour"},"duration":{"type":"String","label":"Duration","value":"Until dispelled or triggered"},"damage":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Damage","value":""},"damageType":{"type":"String","label":"Damage Type","value":""},"save":{"type":"String","label":"Saving Throw","value":""},"concentration":{"type":"Boolean","label":"Requires Concentration","value":false},"ritual":{"type":"Boolean","label":"Cast as Ritual","value":false},"ability":{"type":"String","label":"Spellcasting Ability","value":""},"prepared":{"type":"String","label":"Prepared Spell","value":false}},"flags":{},"type":"spell","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/runes-royal-2.jpg"}

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum⁠ but instead viewed an illusion⁠, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p>\n<p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p>\n<p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source","value":"PHB pg. 281"},"spellType":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Type","value":"utility"},"level":{"type":"Number","label":"Spell Level","value":7},"school":{"type":"String","label":"Spell School","value":"con"},"components":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Components","value":"V"},"materials":{"type":"String","label":"Materials","value":""},"target":{"type":"String","label":"Target","value":"You and up to eight willing creatures"},"range":{"type":"String","label":"Range","value":"10 ft."},"time":{"type":"String","label":"Casting Time","value":"1 Action"},"duration":{"type":"String","label":"Duration","value":""},"damage":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Damage","value":""},"damageType":{"type":"String","label":"Damage Type","value":""},"save":{"type":"String","label":"Saving Throw","value":""},"concentration":{"type":"Boolean","label":"Requires Concentration","value":false},"ritual":{"type":"Boolean","label":"Cast as Ritual","value":false},"ability":{"type":"String","label":"Spellcasting Ability","value":""},"prepared":{"type":"String","label":"Prepared Spell","value":false}},"flags":{},"type":"spell","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/runes-magenta-3.jpg"}
