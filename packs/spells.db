If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.</p>\n<p>In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC – 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster—for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage—the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any further damage from it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage of the image's Strikes increases by 1d4, and the maximum size of creature you can create increases by one (to a maximum of Gargantuan).</p>"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source","value":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=158"},"spellType":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Type","value":"utility"},"level":{"type":"Number","label":"Spell Level","value":2},"traditions":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Traditions","value":["arcane","occult"]},"school":{"type":"String","label":"Spell School","value":"ill"},"components":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Components","value":"somatic, verbal"},"materials":{"type":"String","label":"Materials","value":""},"target":{"type":"String","label":"Target","value":""},"range":{"type":"String","label":"Range","value":"500 feet"},"area":{"type":"String","label":"Area","value":0,"areaType":""},"time":{"type":"String","label":"Casting Time","value":"2"},"duration":{"type":"String","label":"Duration","value":"sustained"},"damage":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Damage","applyMod":false,"value":""},"damageType":{"type":"String","label":"Damage Type","value":""},"save":{"type":"String","label":"Saving Throw","basic":"","value":""},"sustained":{"type":"Boolean","label":"Can be Sustained"},"cost":{"type":"String","label":"Cost","value":""},"ability":{"type":"String","label":"Spellcasting Ability"},"prepared":{"type":"String","label":"Prepared Spell"},"traits":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Traits","value":["auditory","illusion","visual"]},"location":{"type":"String","label":"Spellcasting Entry Location"}},"sort":1800000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"}

While the entrance to the mansion is closed, effects from outside the mansion fail to penetrate it, and vice versa, except for plane shift, which can be used to enter the mansion. You can use scrying magic and similar effects to observe the outside only if they're capable of crossing planes. A staff of up to 24 servants attends to anyone within the mansion. These are like the servant created by the unseen servant spell, though they're visible, with an appearance you determine during casting. The mansion is stocked with enough food to serve a nine-course banquet to 150 people.</p>"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source","value":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=183"},"spellType":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Type","value":"utility"},"level":{"type":"Number","label":"Spell Level","value":7},"traditions":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Traditions","value":["arcane","occult"]},"school":{"type":"String","label":"Spell School","value":"con"},"components":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Components","value":"1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)"},"materials":{"type":"String","label":"Materials"},"target":{"type":"String","label":"Target"},"range":{"type":"String","label":"Range","value":"30 feet"},"area":{"type":"String","label":"Area"},"time":{"type":"String","label":"Casting Time"},"duration":{"type":"String","label":"Duration","value":"24 hours"},"damage":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Damage","applyMod":false,"value":null},"damageType":{"type":"String","label":"Damage Type"},"save":{"type":"String","label":"Saving Throw","basic":""},"sustained":{"type":"Boolean","label":"Can be Sustained"},"cost":{"type":"String","label":"Cost"},"ability":{"type":"String","label":"Spellcasting Ability"},"prepared":{"type":"String","label":"Prepared Spell"},"traits":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Traits","value":["conjuration","extradimensional"]},"location":{"type":"String","label":"Spellcasting Entry Location"}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"icons/mystery-man.png"}

The spiritual guardian is translucent and appears to be holding your deity's favored weapon. When you Cast the Spell, the spiritual guardian appears in an unoccupied space next to a foe of your choice within range and makes a Strike against it. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can move the spiritual guardian to an unoccupied space next to a target within range (if necessary) and make a Strike with it. The guardian uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. Alternatively, when you Sustain the Spell, you can have the guardian move adjacent to an ally and protect that ally. If you do, each time the ally would take damage, the guardian takes the first 10 damage instead of your ally. It continues to do so until you move the guardian to attack an enemy or defend a different ally, or until the guardian is destroyed (it has 50 Hit Points and can't recover Hit Points by any means). The guardian can't usually take damage except when protecting an ally, though disintegrate automatically destroys it if it hits the spiritual guardian's AC of 25. The guardian's Strikes are melee spell attacks. Regardless of the appearance of the guardian's weapon, the guardian deals force damage equal to 2d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, but you can deal damage of the type normally dealt by the weapon it holds instead of force damage. No other traits or statistics of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. Despite making a spell attack, the spiritual guardian's weapon is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth. The guardian takes up space and allies can use it when flanking, but it doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have aside from Hit Points, and creatures can move through its space without hindrance. The guardian can't make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons or enhance allies do not apply to the guardian.</p>\r<p>\n<hr><hr><b>Heightened (+2)</b>  The guardian's damage increases by 1d8, and its Hit Points increase by 20.</p>"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source","value":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=305"},"spellType":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Type","value":"attack"},"level":{"type":"Number","label":"Spell Level","value":5},"traditions":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Traditions","value":["divine"]},"school":{"type":"String","label":"Spell School","value":"abj"},"components":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Components","value":"somatic, verbal"},"materials":{"type":"String","label":"Materials"},"target":{"type":"String","label":"Target"},"range":{"type":"String","label":"Range","value":"120 feet"},"area":{"type":"String","label":"Area"},"time":{"type":"String","label":"Casting Time","value":"2"},"duration":{"type":"String","label":"Duration","value":"sustained up to 1 minute"},"damage":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Damage","applyMod":false,"value":"2d8"},"damageType":{"type":"String","label":"Damage Type","value":"force"},"save":{"type":"String","label":"Saving Throw","basic":""},"sustained":{"type":"Boolean","label":"Can be Sustained"},"cost":{"type":"String","label":"Cost"},"ability":{"type":"String","label":"Spellcasting Ability"},"prepared":{"type":"String","label":"Prepared Spell"},"traits":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Traits","value":["abjuration","attack","force"]},"location":{"type":"String","label":"Spellcasting Entry Location"}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"icons/mystery-man.png"}

These elements generate appropriate sounds and smells, and they feel right to the touch. Elements of an illusory scene are incapable of speech. Unlike with the illusory creature spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a hallucinatory terrain spell. When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion. Any creature that touches any part of the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. If they interact with a portion of the illusion, they disbelieve only that portion.

The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet long and 30 feet high. If the wall would pass through a creature, the spell is lost. The wall sheds bright light for 20 feet on each side, and dim light for the next 20 feet. You can ignore the wall's effects. Roll 1d4 to determine the color of the wall. Each color has a particular effect on items, effects, or creatures that attempt to pass through. Chromatic wall can't be counteracted normally; rather, each color is automatically counteracted when targeted by a specific spell, even if that spell's level is lower than that of chromatic wall. Red The wall destroys ranged weapon ammunition (such as arrows and crossbow bolts) that would pass through, and it deals 20 fire damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. Cone of cold can counteract a red chromatic wall. Orange The wall destroys thrown weapons that would pass through, and it deals 25 acid damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. Gust of wind can counteract an orange chromatic wall. Yellow The wall stops acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, and sonic effects from passing through, and it deals 30 electricity damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. Disintegrate can counteract a yellow chromatic wall. Green The wall stops toxins, gases, and breath weapons from passing through. It deals 10 poison damage to anyone passing through and makes them @JournalEntry[Enfeebled] 1 for 1 minute. A basic Fortitude save reduces the damage and negates the @JournalEntry[Enfeebled] condition on a success. Passwall can counteract a green chromatic wall.</p>\r<p>\n<hr><hr><b>Heightened (7th)</b>  The spell's duration increases to 1 hour. Roll 1d8 to determine the wall's color; the results for 5–8 are below. A red, orange, yellow, or green wall deals an extra 10 damage. Blue The wall stops auditory, petrification, and visual effects from passing through, and creatures passing through are subject to the effects of flesh to stone. Magic missile can counteract a blue chromatic wall. Indigo The wall stops divination and mental effects from passing through, and those passing through are subject to the effects of warp mind. Searing light can counteract an indigo chromatic wall. Violet The wall prevents spells from targeting the other side (area effects still cross as normal).
