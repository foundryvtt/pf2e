When you're undetected by a creature, that creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} to you.</p>\n<p>A creature you're undetected by can guess which square you're in to try targeting you. It must pick a square and attempt an attack. This works like targeting a hidden creature (requiring a <a class=\"inline-roll roll\" title=\"DC 11 Flat Check\" data-mode=\"roll\" data-flavor=\"DC 11 Flat Check\" data-formula=\"1d20\"> 1d20</a> <strong>DC 11</strong> flat check, but the flat check and attack roll are rolled in secret by the GM, who doesn't reveal whether the attack missed due to failing the flat check, failing the attack roll, or choosing the wrong square.</p>\n<p>A creature can use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} action to try to find you.</p>"
