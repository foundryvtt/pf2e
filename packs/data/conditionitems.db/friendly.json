A creature that is friendly to a character likes that character. The character can attempt to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Request]{Make a Request} of a friendly creature, and the friendly creature is likely to agree to a simple and safe request that doesn't cost it much to fulfill. If the character or one of their allies uses hostile actions against the creature, the creature gains a worse attitude condition depending on the severity of the hostile action, as determined by the GM.</p>"
