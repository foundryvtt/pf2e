A creature that is helpful to a character wishes to actively aid that character. It will accept reasonable @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Request]{Requests} from that character, as long as such requests aren't at the expense of the helpful creature's goals or quality of life. If the character or one of their allies uses a hostile action against the creature, the creature gains a worse attitude condition depending on the severity of the hostile action, as determined by the GM.</p>"
