You take a -2 status penalty to Perception and skill checks, and you can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they or their intended consequences are related to the subject of your fascination (as determined by the GM). For instance, you might be able to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} and @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Recall Knowledge (Lore)]{Recall Knowledge} about the subject, but you likely couldn't cast a spell targeting a different creature. This condition ends if a creature uses hostile actions against you or any of your allies.</p>"
