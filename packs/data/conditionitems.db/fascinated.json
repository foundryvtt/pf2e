For instance, you might be able to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} and @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Recall Knowledge (Lore)]{Recall Knowledge} about the subject, but you likely couldn't cast a spell targeting a different creature. This condition ends if a creature uses hostile actions against you or any of your allies.</p>"
