On each of its actions, the water rushing from the sluices flows through the room, creating a river of churning water that fills the room to several inches and makes the floor of the chamber into difficult terrain. The water level never rises above this level in the room, as it drains out of the chutes to the south and begins to flood the quarry pit (area <strong>J2</strong>). On the trap's second turn, the water starts filling the four slave pits in area <strong>J2</strong>. Each of the trap's actions fills the pits 4 inches (2 feet per round if all sluices are functional). If the slave pits fill to their total depth of 12 feet and the grates over the slave pits aren't open, the slaves begin to drown, dying if they aren't freed in 5 rounds. Once the slave pits are full, the water continues to slowly fill the central area over the course of an hour until it empties the reservoir and floods area <strong>J2</strong> to a depth of 15 feet.</p>\n<p>Other options beyond disabling or destroying the sluices could prevent the flooding of the quarry pit at your discretion.</p>"
