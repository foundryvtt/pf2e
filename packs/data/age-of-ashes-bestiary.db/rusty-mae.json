While performing this ritual, the secondary casters entreat your deity, explaining what sort of assistance you need and why you need it; if the task is incredibly fitting to your deity, the GM can grant a circumstance bonus to the secondary Diplomacy check or rule that the check is automatically a critical success. If the ritual succeeds, you must offer the servitor payment depending on factors such as the duration and danger of the task. Payment always costs at least as much as a consumable item of the creature's level, even for a short and simple task, and it often costs as much as a permanent magic item of the creature's level to persuade a creature to fight alongside you. If you use the ritual without good reason, the result is automatically a critical failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Your deity sends a servitor, and the servitor's payment costs only half as much as normal. If you ask for a particular servitor by name, your deity is likely to send that servitor unless the servitor is busy.<br /><strong>Success</strong> Your deity sends a servitor.<br /><strong>Failure</strong> Your deity does not send a servitor.<br /><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your deity is offended and sends a sign of displeasure or possibly even a servitor to scold or attack you, depending on your deity's nature.

This involves performing an 8-hour ceremony with all prospective coven members. After the coven is formed, each of its members gains elite adjustments, adjusting their levels accordingly. Coven members can sense other members' locations and conditions by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and can sense what another coven member is sensing as a two-action activity, which has the concentrate trait as well.<br /><br /> Covens also grant spells and rituals to their members, but these can be cast only in cooperation between three coven members who are all within 30 feet of one another. A coven member can contribute to a coven spell with a single-action spellcasting activity that has a single verbal component. If two coven members have contributed these actions within the last round, a third member can cast a coven spell on her turn by spending the normal spellcasting actions. A coven can cast its coven spells an unlimited number of times but can cast only one coven spell each round. All covens grant the 8th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Baleful Polymorph]{Baleful Polymorph} spell and all the following spells, which the coven can cast at any level up to 5th: @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Augury]{Augury}, @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Charm]{Charm}, @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Clairaudience]{Clairaudience}, @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Clairvoyance]{Clairvoyance}, @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Dream Message]{Dream Message}, @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Illusory Disguise]{Illusory Disguise}, @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Illusory Scene]{Illusory Scene}, @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Prying Eye]{Prying Eye}, and @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Talking Corpse]{Talking Corpse}. Individual creatures with the coven ability also grant additional spells to any coven they join. A coven can also cast the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Control Weather]{Control Weather} ritual, with a DC of 23 instead of the standard DC.<br /><br /> If a coven member leaving the coven or the death of a coven member brings the coven below three members, the remaining members keep their elite adjustments for 24 hours, but without enough members to contribute the necessary actions, they can't cast coven spells.</p>"

Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form.
