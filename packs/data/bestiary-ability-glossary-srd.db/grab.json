The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{grabbed} by whichever body part the monster attacked with, and that body part can&rsquo;t be used to Strike creatures until the grab is ended. Using Grab extends the duration of the monster&rsquo;s Grab until the end of its next turn for all creatures grabbed by it. A grabbed creature can use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escape} action to get out of the grab, and the Grab ends for a grabbed creatures if the monster moves away from it.</p>",
