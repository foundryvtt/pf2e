The monster doesn&rsquo;t need to spend actions on the aura; rather, the aura&rsquo;s effects are applied at specific times, such as when a creature ends its turn in the aura or when creatures enter the aura.</p>\n<p>If an aura does nothing but deal damage, its entry lists only the radius, damage, and saving throw. Such auras deal this damage to a creature when the creature enters the aura and when a creature starts its turn in the aura. A creature can take damage from the aura only once per round.</p>\n<p>The GM might determine that a monster&rsquo;s aura doesn&rsquo;t affect its own allies. For example, a creature might be immune to a monster&rsquo;s frightful presence if they have been around each other for a long time.</p>",
