            "value": "<p>You enforce a magic rule on a willing target, forcing it to either perform or refrain from carrying out a certain act. A <em>geas</em> to perform an act is usually conditional, such as, \"Always offer hospitality to strangers seeking a place to stay.\" An unconditional <em>geas</em> to perform a certain act doesn't require the target to perform that act exclusively, though it must prioritize the task above all leisurely pursuits. The most common <em>geas</em> to refrain from carrying out an act is a specification to avoid violating a contract. In those cases, the secondary caster usually takes charge of making sure the wording of the contract is attuned correctly with the ritual's magic. Because the target is willing, <em>geas</em> can have a duration that lasts for as long as the target agrees to. If the target is unable to fulfill the <em>geas</em>, it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened 1}, and the sickened condition increases by 1 for each consecutive day it is prevented from following the <em>geas</em>, to a maximum of sickened 4. The sickened condition ends immediately when it follows the <em>geas</em> again; it can't remove the sickened condition in any other way. Only powerful magic such as a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Wish]{Wish}</em> spell can remove the effects of <em>geas</em> from a willing target.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The <em>geas</em> succeeds, and the target receives a +1 status bonus to skill checks that directly uphold the <em>geas</em> (at the GM's discretion).</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The <em>geas</em> succeeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The <em>geas</em> fails.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The <em>geas</em> fails, and you are instead affected by the <em>geas</em> you were attempting to place on the target. You are considered an unwilling target, so the <em>geas</em> can be counteracted with a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Remove Curse]{Remove Curse}</em> spell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> You can use <em>geas</em> on an unwilling creature; it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. If the target fails this Will save, the <em>geas</em> lasts up to 1 week. A <em>remove curse</em> spell can counteract a <em>geas</em> on an unwilling creature, in addition to powerful magic such as a <em>wish</em> spell. A clever unwilling creature can subvert the <em>geas</em> by contriving situations that prevent it from complying, but in that case it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened} (as described above).</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> As 5th level, but the <em>geas</em> lasts for up to 1 year on an unwilling creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> As 5th level, but the <em>geas</em> lasts for a duration you choose (even unlimited) on an unwilling creature.</p>"
