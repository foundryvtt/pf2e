The attacker takes 2d8 mental damage and must attempt a Will save.</p>\n<p>Afterward, the spell ends for the cloaked creature, and the attacker is temporarily immune to <em>mirecloak</em> for 24 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The attacker is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The attacker takes half damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The attacker takes full damage and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened 1}. In addition, the cloaked creature gleans a piece of information from the attacker's mind. The details and extent of this information are at the GM's discretion.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the attacker takes double damage and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened 2}.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.spell-effects.Spell Effect: Mirecloak]{Spell Effect: Mirecloak}</p>"
