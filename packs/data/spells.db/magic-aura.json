If the target is magical, you can instead choose to have it appear as entirely non-magical. A caster using <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Detect Magic]{Detect Magic}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Read Aura]{Read Aura}</em> of an equal or higher spell level can attempt to disbelieve the illusion from magic aura. Magic aura doesn't mask the aura of spells that are 9th level or higher or of items that are 19th level or higher.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> You can target a creature instead of an object.
