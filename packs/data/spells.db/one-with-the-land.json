You can cast spells while in the feature as long as they don't require line of effect beyond the feature. You can Dismiss the spell.

These are melee Strikes that use your spell attack roll, can target any creature within 60 feet of you, and deal [[/r 5d12]] bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make a terrain vengeance Strike.</li>\n<li>By spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can increase or decrease the environmental temperature changing it to either one step warmer than normal, one step colder than normal, or the normal temperature.</li>\n<li>As a 2-action activity that has the concentrate trait, you can create or remove difficult terrain caused by natural terrain in a 20-foot burst within 200 feet.
