            "value": "<p>You draw a permanent series of complex illusions over the&nbsp;target settlement, choosing the look, sound, feel, and smell&nbsp;of the structures, terrain, and creatures within at the time the&nbsp;ritual is cast. You can alter the appearance of existing structures&nbsp;and creatures, and you can add illusory structures or creatures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, you could cause everything and everyone in the&nbsp;target area to appear green, create an illusory forest with a&nbsp;thick canopy that obscures the settlement from outside view,&nbsp;or make empty ruins seem inhabited and pristine. When you&nbsp;create the facade, you determine which illusory elements&nbsp;remain static (limited to basic natural movement, such as flags&nbsp;blowing in the breeze) and which follow a basic program (for example, a daily parade in the town square, complete with&nbsp;marching band). You’re unable to alter the programs after you&nbsp;create the facade.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can disguise creatures as you please, with the same effects as a 3rd-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.i35dpZFI7jZcRoBo]{Illusory Disguise}. If a creature affected by the facade leaves the area, any illusions affecting it fade after 1 day. You decide when casting the ritual whether newcomers are disguised by the illusions, and whether the disguise appears immediately or after a set period, up to 1 week.</p>\n<p>A creature that interacts with the target settlement in a way&nbsp;that would suggest or reveal the illusory nature of the facade,&nbsp;such as by trying to paint a building affected by the facade or&nbsp;climbing an illusory structure, can attempt to disbelieve the&nbsp;illusion. The illusions created by the spell are harmless, so an&nbsp;illusory river of lava wouldn’t cause damage, nor could thorns on an illusory rose bush prick someone.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You create the facade as described, and you&nbsp;can alter the programs within your facade by spending 1 day&nbsp;to reprogram them.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You create the facade as described.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure </strong>Your illusions fail and the ritual has no effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your ritual produces unexpected and&nbsp;uncontrolled illusions different from what you had planned,&nbsp;such as unexpected and slowly shifting colors across the&nbsp;buildings, unpleasant smells, and creatures appearing as&nbsp;skeletons. These effects fade after 1 month.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> The cost increases to 100,000 gp and the&nbsp;radius can be up to 5 miles.&nbsp;</p>",
