On a success, reduce the target's circumstance bonus to AC (if any) by 1 until the beginning of your next turn. Your <em>phase bolt</em> also gains the following amp.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Amp</strong> Your bolt leaves phase completely, becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Invisible]{Invisible} and intangible until it's already embedded in the target-giving the impression it simply teleported itself into place. The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} against the attack. Additionally, the bolt ignores an amount of Hardness or resistance to piercing damage equal to half the spell's level.
