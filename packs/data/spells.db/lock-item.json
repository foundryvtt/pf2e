To voluntarily drop the weapon, the target must spend an Interact action rather than a free action, and then succeed at a Reflex save. On a failed save, the action is wasted, but on a success, they drop the item and the spell ends. An unwilling creature must attempt an initial Reflex save against lock item. A willing creature can choose to critically fail the saving throw.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is affected for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is affected for 4 rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is affected for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> You can target either 1 additional object held by the same creature or 1 additional object held by 1 additional creature.</p>"
