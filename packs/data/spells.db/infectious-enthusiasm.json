You gain a +1 status bonus to your choice of attack rolls, Will saves, or Charisma-based skill checks. During the spell's duration, an ally who observed you Casting this Spell and was within 30 feet when you did so can take a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to gain the same bonus you chose until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<p>Using this spell to influence someone in a social situation is typically considered a faux pas, negating the benefit on Charisma-based skills if the subject of the check observed you casting the spell.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.spell-effects.Spell Effect: Infectious Enthusiasm]{Spell Effect: Infectious Enthusiasm}</p>"
