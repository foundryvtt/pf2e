A creature that falls into time disappears until the end of your turn. It then reappears in the same space it left; if that space is occupied, it appears in the nearest empty space, chosen by the GM.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature falls into time.
