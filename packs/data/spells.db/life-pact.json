If this healing is enough that the triggering target is no longer reduced to 0 Hit Points, they remain conscious. Once the triggering target has regained Hit Points from the other targets, the spell ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> Increase the number of Hit Points lost by 1 for each target other than the one reduced to 0 Hit Points.
