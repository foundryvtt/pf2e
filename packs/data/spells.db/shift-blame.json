The target must attempt a Will save and is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target knows you attempted to alter its memories.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target doesn't realize you attempted to alter its memories, though it knows you cast a spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You successfully alter the target's memory. It isn't forced to react to the new memories in a particular way, and it's likely to question them if they contradict other information it knows or are implausible for the situation.</p>"
