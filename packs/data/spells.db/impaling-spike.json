The creature takes full damage and, if it's standing on solid ground, becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Immobilized]{Immobilized}. It can attempt to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Escape]{Escape}(the DC is your spell DC). While it remains impaled, it takes damage from any weakness to cold iron it has at the end of each of its turns.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature is impaled through a vital organ or its center of mass, taking double damage, and it is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} as long as it's impaled.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 2d6 piercing.</p>"
