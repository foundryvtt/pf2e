You can Dismiss this spell. If the possessed body dies, the spell ends and you must succeed at a Fortitude save against your spell DC or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Paralyzed]{Paralyzed} for 1 hour, or 24 hours on a critical failure. If the spell ends during an encounter, you act just before the possessed creature's initiative count.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You possess the target but can't control it. You ride along in the body while the spell lasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You possess the target and take partial control of it. You no longer have a separate turn; instead, you might control the target. At the start of each of the target's turns, it attempts another Will save. If it fails, it's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Controlled]{Controlled} by you on that turn; if it succeeds, it chooses its own actions; and if it critically succeeds, it forces you out and the spell ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You possess the target fully, and it can only watch as you manipulate it like a puppet. The target is Controlled by you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The duration is 10 minutes, and you can physically enter the creature's body, protecting your physical body while the spell lasts.</p>"
