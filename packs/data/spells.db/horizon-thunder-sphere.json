Make a ranged spell attack roll against your target's AC. On a success, you deal 3d6 electricity damage. On a critical success, the target takes double damage and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Dazzled]{Dazzled} for 1 round. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines the range and other parameters.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> <strong>(somatic, verbal)</strong> This spell has a range of 30 feet.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pf2-icon\">3</span> <strong>(material, somatic, verbal)</strong> This spell has a range of 60 feet and deals half damage on a failure (but not a critical failure) as the electricity lashes out and jolts the target.</p>\n<p><strong>Two Rounds</strong> If you spend 3 actions Casting the Spell, you can avoid finishing the spell and spend another 3 actions on your next turn to empower the spell even further. If you do, after attacking the target, whether you hit or miss, the ball of lightning explodes, dealing [[/r {2d6}[electricity]]]{2d6 electricity damage} to all other creatures in a 10-foot emanation around the target (basic Reflex save). Additionally, you spark with electricity for 1 minute, dealing [[/r {1}[electricity]]]{1 electricity damage} to creatures that Grab you or that hit you with an unarmed Strike or a non-reach melee weapon.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The initial damage on a hit, as well as the burst damage for two-round casting time, each increase by [[/r {2d6}[electricity]]], and the damage creatures take if they Grapple or hit you while you're in your sparking state increases by [[/r {1}[electricity]]].</p>"
