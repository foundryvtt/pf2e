You gain a +1 status bonus to Games Lore checks to gamble, and if you roll a critical failure on such a check, you get a failure instead; however, the spell is too short-lived to use for Earn Income checks from gambling.</p>\n<p>When you're under the effect of nudge the odds, one facial feature, such as a lock of hair or the iris of an eye, transforms to a distinctive golden color; the GM chooses which feature when you cast the spell. This change resists all magical efforts to conceal it, though it can be hidden or covered by mundane means. A creature noticing the feature can identify the spell using Recall Knowledge. Because it prevents losing big, gamblers consider nudge the odds a repugnant form of cheating. If you're caught using the spell, you are likely to suffer serious consequences, depending on the nature of the gamblers you cheated.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Spell effect: Nudge the Odds]{Spell effect: Nudge the Odds}</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> The status bonus increases to +2, and the duration increases to last until the next time you make your daily preparations.
