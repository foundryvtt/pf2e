The bird has the statistics of a homunculus, save that it has all of your senses and shares your Perception modifier. Once the spell's duration elapses or upon a trigger you set (which must be fairly simple-\"at dusk\" or \"when the judge leaves\"), the bird flies to your location. If you wring its neck and drink its blood, you learn all that it saw since its creation.</p>"
