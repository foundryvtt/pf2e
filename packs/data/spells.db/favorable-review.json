You can Dismiss the spell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected and knows you tried to trick it.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was something harmless instead of favorable review, unless it identifies the spell (usually using @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Identify Magic]{Identify Magic}).</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target cannot speak unfavorably about the subject for 1 week. This doesn't change the target's opinion about the subject, but the target's attempts to speak ill of the subject-whether in speech, writing, or other communication-always twist into compliments and praise instead. The target likely becomes aware of this effect quickly and can avoid speaking about the subject entirely if they choose.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the duration is permanent and the target genuinely holds a favorable opinion about the subject, with their attitude toward the creature (or creatures associated with the subject, such as the owner of a location or artists in a performance) becoming two degrees better (for example, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Helpful]{Helpful} instead of @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Indifferent]{Indifferent}.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> The range increases to 60 feet and you can target up to 10 creatures.</p>"
