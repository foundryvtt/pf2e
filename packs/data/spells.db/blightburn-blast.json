These crystals are radioactive and flood the vault with lethal energy. Creatures other than those native to the vault or who have survived there for a long time develop a disease called blightburn sickness.</p>\n<p>Creatures native to the Black Desert are immune, as are creatures who are affected by blightburn sickness but recover from it. The target can't recover from the disease's drained or sickened condition except by magic.</p>\n<p>The surest way to avoid contracting blightburn sickness is by wearing a blightburn ward, a piece of protective jewelry often found among urdefhans' gear or for sale in Shraen.</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> DC 32 Fortitude</p>\n<p><strong>Onset</strong> [[/r 1d4 #days]]{1d4 days}</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Drained]{Drained 1} (1 day)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Drained]{Drained 1} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened 1} (1 day)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Drained]{Drained 2} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened 2} (1 week)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 4</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Drained]{Drained 3} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened 3} (1 month)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 5</strong> Drained increases by 1 (1 year)</p>"
