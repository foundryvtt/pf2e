If you can cast a spell with the revelation trait that affects your senses, such as <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.See Invisibility]{See Invisibility}</em>, while this spell is active, you gain the benefit of the spell through the target's senses instead of your own. You can also speak through the target, with a voice much like yours, though it takes on some of the timbre and character of the target's growls or squawks. You can use @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Command an Animal]{Command an Animal} on the target as part of @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Sustain a Spell]{Sustaining this Spell}. You don't need line of sight or line of effect to your target when you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Cast a Spell]{Cast this Spell}.</p>"
