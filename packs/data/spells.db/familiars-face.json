You can also speak through the target, with a voice much like yours, though it takes on some of the timbre and character of the target's growls or squawks. You can use @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Command an Animal]{Command an Animal} on the target as part of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Sustain a Spell]{Sustaining this Spell}.
