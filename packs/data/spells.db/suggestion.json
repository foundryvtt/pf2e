The spell has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the base duration is 1 hour.</p>\n<hr /><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> You can target up to 10 creatures."
