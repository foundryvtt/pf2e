For the duration, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Medicine checks against the target that depend on its organs, but a -2 circumstance penalty on Medicine checks depending on seeing its skin.</p>\n<p>When you Cast the Spell, attempt a special Recall Knowledge check using Medicine to spot and discern a vital organ. If you have a Lore skill appropriate to the creature, you can use that skill instead of Medicine. If you succeed, the next time you deal piercing or slashing damage to the target with a Strike or spell, you deal 4d6 additional precision damage. Once on each of your subsequent turns, you can use a single action to attempt the special Recall Knowledge check again. The extra damage isn't cumulative, so making the check more than once before a Strike or spell has no extra benefit.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.spell-effects.Spell Effect: Organsight]{Spell Effect: Organsight}</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The precision damage increases by [[/r 1d6]]{1d6}.</p>"
