Whenever a creature attacks the target and is adjacent to it, the attacker must attempt a Will save at the end of its action. On a failure, it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Dazzled]{Dazzled} until the end of its next turn. Regardless of the result of the save, the attacker is temporarily immune until the end of its next turn. The dazzling effect has the light and visual traits.</p>\n<p>When you cast the spell, roll [[/r 2d8]]{1d8 twice} on the table below to see the armor's colors (rerolling any duplicates). Each color grants resistance 5 to the indicated damage type.
