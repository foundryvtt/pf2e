The primary caster serves as an emcee or leader, while each secondary caster provides a heartfelt anecdote that somehow involves the public work; for instance, recounting a story of playing at a fountain each summer. The anecdotes don't need to be firsthand accounts-a community member might sing of how their grandparents fell in love crossing a bridge every day-but they must be directly connected in some way.
