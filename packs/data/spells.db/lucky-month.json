Once per week, when rolling a saving throw or skill check, you can use the token's power and roll twice, taking the higher result. This is a fortune effect.

Once per week, the ritual's recipient must roll twice and take the worse result for their first significant saving throw or skill check of the week, as determined by the GM.
