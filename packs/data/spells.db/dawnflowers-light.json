This light suppresses magical darkness of your Dawnflower's light spell's level or lower.</p>\n<p>Finally, the supernatural light created by this spell is similar to sunlight, and while it can't damage creatures normally harmed by sunlight, it does make them uncomfortable so that they suffer a -2 status penalty to saves versus fear effects while in the area of bright light.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> The status bonus increases to +3.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The status bonus increases to +4.</p>"
