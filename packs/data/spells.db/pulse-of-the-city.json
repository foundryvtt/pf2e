You never learn clandestine movements or other details people are specifically trying to hide. The spell is also notoriously bad at overcoming magic meant to avoid detection; it automatically fails to reveal information about events involving creatures, places, or objects affected by spells that could prevent or counteract pulse of the city (such as @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Nondetection]{Nondetection}).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> The range increases to 100 miles.</p>"
