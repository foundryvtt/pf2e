This alternate vision fades quickly, but the glimpse beyond the natural world lingers for the spell's duration.</p>\n<p>Aberrations or worshippers of Outer Gods or Great Old Ones are bolstered by this vision of warped reality and gain a +1 status bonus to Will saving throws and attack rolls for 1 minute, while all other creatures must attempt a Will saving throw.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened 1}.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 minute and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Frightened]{Frightened 1}.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is stupefied 1 for 1 minute and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Frightened]{Frightened 2}.
