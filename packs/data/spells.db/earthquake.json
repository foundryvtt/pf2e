The fissures are permanent, and their sides require successful DC 15 Athletics to Climb.</li>\n<li><strong>Collapse</strong> Structures and ceilings might collapse. The GM rolls a flat check for each (DC 16 for a sturdy structure, DC 14 for an average structure and most natural formations, DC 9 for a shoddy structure, all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage; each creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex save to avoid it.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature takes half the collapse damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half the collapse damage and falls @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Prone]{Prone}.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls Prone.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls into a fissure.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> You create a massive earthquake that can devastate a settlement.
