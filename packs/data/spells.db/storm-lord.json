Creatures in the area take a -2 circumstance penalty to Acrobatics and Perception checks.</li>\n<li><strong>Wind</strong> Powerful winds buffet the area in all directions. Ranged attacks take a -4 circumstance penalty, and all flying is against the wind and counts as moving through difficult terrain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, once per round you can use a single action, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits, to call down a bolt of lightning, striking any target in range that you can see. You deal 10d6 electricity damage to the target; it must attempt a basic Reflex save. On a failure, it is also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Deafened]{Deafened} for 1 round.</p>"
