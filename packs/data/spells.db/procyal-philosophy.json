The image is just a floating magical manifestation and doesn't occupy any space. The procyal offers helpful suggestions, preparing to Aid the target as though the procyal had its own reaction. The procyal uses a bonus equal to your spell DC - 10 for its rolls to Aid.</p>\n<p>On each of your turns, the procyal prepares to Aid its target again. You can use a free action, which has the concentrate trait, to redirect the procyal image to a different creature, changing the target of the spell. Otherwise, the procyal keeps aiding the same creature for the duration of the spell.</p>"
