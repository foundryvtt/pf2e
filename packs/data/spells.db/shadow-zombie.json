While in this vaporous state, the zombie is a minion under your control, gains resistance 8 to physical damage, and is immune to precision damage. It can't cast spells, activate items, or use actions that have the attack or manipulate traits. It gains a fly Speed of 10 feet and can slip through tiny cracks. If the target is already your minion when you cast the spell, it doesn't get a saving throw and becomes vaporous for 10 minutes. If the target is not your minion, it can attempt a Will save to resist the spell. If it's already under someone else's command, the controlling creature also rolls a Will save, and the zombie uses the better result.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target becomes your shadowy minion for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but for 10 minutes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> You can target a zombie of level 5 or lower.</p>"
