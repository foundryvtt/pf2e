As a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can change one of your chosen abilities to a different option from the list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enlarging Eruption</strong> You erupt in lava, which clings to you and hardens, causing your body to swell and burst until you grow to size Large. You're clumsy 1. Your reach increases by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if you started out Tiny), and you gain a +2 status bonus to melee damage. You can't choose this option if you're already Large or larger. @Compendium[pf2e.spell-effects.Spell Effect: Mantle of the Magma Heart (Enlarging Eruption)]{Spell Effect: Mantle of the Magma Heart (Enlarging Eruption)}</li>\n<li><strong>Fiery Grasp</strong> Your hands swell and grow with lava. You gain a lava fist unarmed attack in the brawling weapon group. Your lava fists deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage as their base damage, plus an additional 2d6 fire damage and 1d6 persistent fire damage. @Compendium[pf2e.spell-effects.Spell Effect: Mantle of the Magma Heart (Fiery Grasp)]{Spell Effect: Mantle of the Magma Heart (Fiery Grasp)}</li>\n<li><strong>Heart of Fire</strong> Your body's temperature becomes so hot that any creature that touches you, or that hits you with a melee unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon attack, takes [[/r {2d6}[fire]]]{2d6 fire damage}.</li>\n<li><strong>Warming Flames</strong> Flames flicker around you, warming away the cold while protecting you from the heat.
