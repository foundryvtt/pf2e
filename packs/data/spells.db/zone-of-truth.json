It uses the results of this initial save if it leaves and reenters the area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment; therefore, they can avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they can be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth.</p>\n<hr /><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target takes a -2 status penalty to Deception checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target can't speak any deliberate and intentional lies, and it takes a -2 status penalty to Deception checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target can't speak any deliberate and intentional lies and takes a -4 status penalty to Deception checks.</p>"
