While affected, the creature must attempt another save at the start of its turn; on a failure, it's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Slowed]{Slowed 1} for that turn as it sobs uncontrollably.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature takes double damage and for 1 minute, it's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 4} and slowed 1 as it sobs uncontrollably.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The mental damage increases by [[/r 1d6]]{1d6}.</p>"
