The target must have died within the past year. If @Compendium[pf2e.deities.Pharasma]{Pharasma} has decided that the target's time has come or the target doesn't wish to return, this ritual automatically fails, but you discover this after the successful Religion check and can end the ritual without paying the cost.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You resurrect the target. They return to life with full Hit Points and the same spells prepared and points in their pools they had when they died, and still suffering from any long-term debilitations of the old body. The target meets an agent of their deity during the resurrection who inspires them, granting them a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, Perception, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 week. The target is also permanently changed in some way by their time in the afterlife, such as gaining a slight personality shift, a streak of white in the hair, or a strange new birthmark.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, except the target returns to life with 1 Hit Point and no spells prepared or points in any pools, and still is affected by any long-term debilitations of the old body. Instead of inspiring them, the character's time in the Boneyard has left them temporarily debilitated. The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Drained]{Drained 1}, and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} for 1 week; these conditions can't be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> Your attempt is unsuccessful.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Something goes horribly wrong-an evil spirit possesses the body, the body transforms into a special kind of undead, or some worse fate befalls the target.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> You can resurrect a target of up to 12th level, and the base cost is 125 gp.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> You can use resurrect even with only a small portion of the body; the ritual creates a new body on a success or critical success. The target must have died within the past decade. The ritual requires four secondary casters, each of whom must be at least half the target's level. The target can be up to 14th level, and the base cost is 200 gp.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> As 7th level, but the target can be up to 16th level and the base cost is 300 gp.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> You can use resurrect even without the body as long as you know the target's name and have touched a portion of its body at any time. The target must have died within the past century, and it doesn't gain the negative conditions on a success. The ritual requires eight secondary casters, each of whom must be at least half the target's level. The target can be up to 18th level, and the base cost is 600 gp.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> As 9th level, except it doesn't matter how long ago the target died. The ritual requires 16 secondary casters, each of whom must be at least half the target's level. The target can be up to 20th level, and the ritual's base cost is 1,000 gp.</p>"
