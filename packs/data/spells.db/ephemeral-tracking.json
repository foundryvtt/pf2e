You can use Survival to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Track]{Track} through both air and water, noticing aerial or aquatic \"tracks\" of all creatures who passed nearby in the last hour. It's more difficult to Track in this way: the DC to Track through air or water is always at least 30, or higher after precipitation or wind (in the air) or heavy tides or currents (in the water). It's possible to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Cover Tracks]{Cover Tracks} against this spell, but creatures might not realize they need to do so.</p>"
