The target's body becomes Stunned. While its body is stunned in this way, the target remains fully aware in soul form; it simply can't consciously move its body (though the body makes basic instinctual defensive movements). The target's soul has the incorporeal trait, is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Invisible]{Invisible}, and has a fly Speed of 60 feet. It can't attack, cast spells, or attempt any skill checks that require a physical body, and it must always maintain line of effect to its body. When the target's body ceases being stunned, the target's soul instantly returns to its body as the target wakes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+3)</strong> If a willing ally chooses to critically fail, it can stay in soul form for 1 additional round.</p>"
