In your ki form, your hair, feathers, skin, or scales change color and begin to glow.</p>\n<p>In this form you gain a Fly Speed equal to your land Speed.</p>\n<p>Choose force, lawful (only if you are lawful), negative, or positive damage. All your Strikes deal [[/r 1d6]] additional damage of the chosen type.</p>\n<p>Your entire body is also surrounded by a glowing corona of the same color as your inner ki; this is a light effect. Your corona is a 5-foot emanation that deals [[/r 2d6]] damage of the chosen type to creatures who start their turn within the emanation. If the emanation overlaps with a darkness effect, the corona's glow attempts to counteract the darkness effect. Regardless of the outcome, the corona can't attempt to counteract that effect again for 1 day. As a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can flare your corona out to become a 30-foot emanation.</p>\n<p>In your ki form, your emotions surge to the forefront and it's difficult to moderate your attacks. Your weapons and unarmed attacks lose the nonlethal trait. You take a -2 status penalty to saves against emotion effects but gain a +2 status bonus to saves against all other mental effects.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.spell-effects.Spell Effect: Ki Form]{Spell Effect: Ki Form}</p>"
