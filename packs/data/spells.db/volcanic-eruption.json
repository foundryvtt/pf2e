The lava rapidly cools and encases creatures in the area. A creature encased in rock is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1} and takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speeds. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to a flying creature, and such creatures immediately descend 20 feet the moment they're encased, but they don't take damage from this fall. A creature encased in rock can attempt to Escape against your spell DC to end the effect. Otherwise, the creature remains encased until it takes a total of 50 damage, freeing it from the rock. Additionally, creatures in the area and those within 5 feet of the lava column automatically take 3d6 fire damage from the intense heat, regardless of the results of their saving throws.</p>\n<hr /><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes full damage and is encased.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature takes double damage and is encased.</p>\n<hr /><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage in the area increases by 2d6, and the damage from the intense heat increases by 1d6."
