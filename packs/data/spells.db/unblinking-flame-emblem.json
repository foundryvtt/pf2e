Attack rolls against the target gain a +1 status bonus, and successful Strikes against the target deal [[/r 1d6[fire]]] damage, and [[/r {1d10}[persistent,fire]]]{1d10} @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Persistent Damage]{Persistent Fire Damage} on a critical hit. However, you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} against other enemies, as the information from the emblem distracts you. The emblem takes your full attention; if you use <em>unblinking flame emblem</em> again before the original duration expires, the new casting replaces the previous casting.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The fire damage increases to [[/r 1d8[fire]]] damage, and the persistent fire damage on a critical hit increases to [[/r {1d12}[persistent,fire]]]{1d12}.</p>"
