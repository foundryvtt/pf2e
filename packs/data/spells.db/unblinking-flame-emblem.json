Attack rolls against the target gain a +1 status bonus, and successful Strikes against the target deal [[/r 1d6[fire]]] damage, and [[/r 1d10[persistent,fire]]] damage on a critical hit. However, you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} against other enemies, as the information from the emblem distracts you.
