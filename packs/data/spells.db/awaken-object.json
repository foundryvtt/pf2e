However, an object that has already been awakened can have the animate object ritual cast on it by doubling the cost of animate object.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers each increase to +2 if they were lower, and it becomes friendly to you for awakening it.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers increase to +0.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is unaffected and the ritual fails.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target is unaffected, and the primary caster's intellect is trapped in the object for 24 hours.
