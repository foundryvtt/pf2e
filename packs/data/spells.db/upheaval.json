Cliffs might collapse, causing creatures to fall, or a river might be blocked and flood the surrounding area.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stone Debris</strong> The area becomes difficult terrain.</li>\n<li><strong>Rising Pillars</strong> Pillars of smooth stone rise from your chosen number of 10-foot squares on a surface in the area, ascending up to 60 feet in height. Each pillar stops when it hits a structure or ceiling unless that structure collapses (see below). The DC to Climb or Grab an Edge on a pillar is 30. Each creature on a pillar after it rises must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or fall off the nearest edge (the creature can choose which edge, if several are equally close). A creature on a pillar that is stopped by a structure falls without attempting a save.</li>\n<li><strong>Structural Collapse</strong> Structures and ceilings might collapse. The GM rolls a flat check for each (DC 14 for a sturdy structure, DC 9 for an average structure and most natural formations, all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit). In general, shoddy structures automatically collapse. A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures beneath it; each creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex save to avoid it. If the creature is forced to attempt a Reflex save because it was on a rising pillar, it uses the same result.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature takes half collapse damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half the collapse damage and falls @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Prone]{Prone}.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls prone.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature takes the full collapse damage and is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Restrained]{Restrained} by debris until it successfully Escapes (DC equal to the spell's save DC).</p>"
