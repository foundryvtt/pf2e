At the start of its turn, each target rolls a DC 8 flat check. On a failure, it's attacked by swarming creatures that deal 2d10 slashing damage. The target attempts a basic Reflex save, and it is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} for 1 round on any outcome other than a critical success.</li>\n<li>The target loses any connection to nature or natural creatures. The target has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check when casting any primal spell or the spell fails. Furthermore, animal or plant creatures become hostile to it, even one with a strong bond to the target, such as an animal companion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The GM might decide that you can't subject some creatures, such as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature.</p>"
