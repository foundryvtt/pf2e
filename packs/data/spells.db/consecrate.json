Attacks made by worshippers of your deity within the area deal 1 damage of one of your deity's alignment types (your choice); if your deity is true neutral, you don't gain this benefit.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The consecration succeeds, and it either lasts for 10 years instead of 1 or covers an area with twice the radius. Occasionally, with your deity's favor, this might produce an even more amazing effect, such as a permanently consecrated area or the effect covering an entire cathedral.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The consecration succeeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The consecration fails.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The consecration fails spectacularly and angers your deity, who sends a sign of displeasure. For at least 1 year, further attempts to consecrate the site fail.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> The consecrated area also gains the effects of the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Dimensional Lock]{Dimensional Lock}</em> spell, but the effect doesn't attempt to counteract teleportation by worshippers of your deity. The cost increases to 200 gp × the spell level.</p>"
