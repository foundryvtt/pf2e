Occasionally, with your deity's favor, this might produce an even more amazing effect, such as a permanently consecrated area or the effect covering an entire cathedral.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Success</strong> The consecration succeeds.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Failure</strong> The consecration fails.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The consecration fails spectacularly and angers your deity, who sends a sign of displeasure.
