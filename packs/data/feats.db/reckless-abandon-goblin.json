Further, enemies and hazards that would damage you this turn roll the minimum possible damage.</p>\n<p>These benefits apply only to harmful effects incurred entirely during your turn in which you activate Reckless Abandon, such as running through a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Prismatic Wall]{Prismatic Wall}</em>. Persistent damage and conditions that were applied prior to your turn proceed normally, and as soon as your turn ends you are subject to the full consequences of any dangers still threatening you.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.feat-effects.Effect: Reckless Abandon (Goblin)]{Effect: Reckless Abandon (Goblin)}</p>"
