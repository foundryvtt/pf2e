You become trained in one skill of your choice, or expert in a skill of your choice in which you were trained. You also become trained in Pathfinder Lore, or an expert if you were already trained. When using a skill untrained, your proficiency bonus is equal to your level instead of 0. You gain access to wayfinders.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Pathfinder Agent archetype.</p>"
