If you have succeeded on a Recall Knowledge check against the target during this combat and their creature type was previously recorded using @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Thorough Reports]{Thorough Reports}, you also deal <a class=\"inline-roll roll\" title=\"persistent bleed\" data-mode=\"roll\" data-flavor=\"persistent bleed\" data-formula=\"1\"> 1</a> point of persistent bleed damage.
