Attempt a Strike against the target; if successful, you deal an additional [[/r {1d6}[precision]]]{1d6 precision damage}. If you have succeeded on a Recall Knowledge check against the target during this combat and their creature type was previously recorded using @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Thorough Reports]{Thorough Reports}, you also deal [[/r {1}[persistent,bleed]]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Persistent Damage]{Persistent Bleed Damage}. The creature is then temporarily immune to Discerning Strike for 1 day.</p>"
