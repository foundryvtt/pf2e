Attempt a Medicine check with the same DC as for @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Treat Wounds]{Treat Wounds}, and restore a corresponding amount of Hit Points; this does not remove the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Wounded]{Wounded} condition. As with Treat Wounds, you can attempt checks against higher DCs if you have the minimum proficiency rank. The target is then temporarily immune to your Battle Medicine for 1 day.</p>\n<p><strong>Editors note</strong> Paizo has clarified the usage of worn tools:</p>\n<blockquote>Worn tools should only take 1 hand to use, as you only draw the things you need from the kit and not the entire kit. This has been marked for future errata.</blockquote>"
