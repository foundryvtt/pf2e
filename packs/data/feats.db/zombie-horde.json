Instead of its normal actions, the companion splits into a horde of Small and Tiny construct companions within a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30] from its original space. The horde makes a Strike against each foe within the emanation with a +2 circumstance bonus to its attack rolls. The multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after the companion makes all the attacks. The miniature companions recombine into a single companion of their original size at any location within the emanation.</p>"
