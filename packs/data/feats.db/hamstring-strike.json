If you hit your prey, the creature takes a -5-foot status penalty to Speed. If you critically hit your prey, the creature takes a -10-foot status penalty to Speed. A creature immune to bleed damage does not take this penalty. The penalty can be removed using any method that removes persistent bleed damage or offers a flat check to do so, such as Administer First Aid.</p>"
