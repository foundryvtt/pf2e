This does not use any spell slots.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the spell is 7th level instead of 9th as you stumble through the movements.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> As critical success, but the spell is 5th level instead of 9th as you stumble through the movements.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You fail to remember the steps of the dance.
