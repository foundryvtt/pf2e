Sticky black tentacles attempt to Trip each creature in the area. Attempt spell attack rolls against the Reflex DCs of each affected creature. Any creature you succeed against is knocked @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Prone]{Prone} and takes [[/r {3d6}[bludgeoning]]]{3d6 bludgeoning damage}. Whenever a creature ends its turn in the area, the tentacles attempt to Trip that creature if it isn't already prone, and they deal [[/r {1d6}[bludgeoning]]]{1d6 bludgeoning damage} to any creature already prone. Creatures treat the spell's area as difficult terrain.</p>"
