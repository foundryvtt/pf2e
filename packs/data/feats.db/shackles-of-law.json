If it hits and deals damage, you can attempt an Athletics check to Grapple the creature you hit. If you're wielding a flail, you can ignore Grapple's requirement that you have a hand free. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both of them.</p>"
