Your chassis is medium armor in the plate armor group that grants a +4 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of -2, a speed penalty of -5 feet, and a Strength value of 16. You can never wear other armor or remove your chassis; however, you still don't become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Fatigued]{Fatigued} from sleeping. Finally, you can etch armor runes onto your chassis as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhancement</strong> Your chassis becomes difficult to overcome.
