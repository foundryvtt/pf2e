You attempt to Make an Impression and then Request your opponent cease their current activity and engage in negotiations. You take a -5 penalty to your Diplomacy check. The GM sets the DC of the Request based on the circumstances-it's generally at least a very hard DC of the creature's level. Some creatures might simply refuse, and even those who agree to parley might ultimately find your arguments lacking and return to violence.</p>"
