The spell is randomly selected from the highest-level spells the foe knows that have a target or area, to a maximum of 8th-level spells; the target loses the appropriate spell slot as if they had cast it themself. You can Cast the Spell once within the next 1d4 rounds, after which the fleeting magic fades; this otherwise works the same as casting a Loaner Spell.</p>\n</section>",
