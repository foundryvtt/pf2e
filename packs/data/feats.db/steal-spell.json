The spell is randomly selected from the highest-level spells the foe knows that have a target or area, to a maximum of 8th-level spells; the target loses the appropriate spell slot as if they had cast it themself.</p>\n<p>You can Cast the Spell once within the next [[/r 1d4 #rounds]] rounds, after which the fleeting magic fades; this otherwise works the same as casting a @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Loaner Spell]{Loaner Spell}.</p>"
