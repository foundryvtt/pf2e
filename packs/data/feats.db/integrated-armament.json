You can draw or stow this item as an Interact action. Creatures don't automatically see this integrated item when it's stowed and must actively @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} in order to find it. They take a -2 circumstance penalty to any checks to do so. While you are wielding the item, it can't be @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Disarm]{Disarm}ed and you can't drop or Release it; you must Interact to store the weapon and free that hand. A creature determined to retrieve the item can do so, but it requires either 1 minute to remove it or extreme violence to your arm-such as physically removing portions of the limb. You can only have one integrated armament at a time, though you can use the 1-minute activity to replace the item or swap the arm in which it's stored.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhancement</strong> Your body has more space for integration. You can now either integrate two one-handed weapons, a one-handed weapon and a shield, or a single two-handed weapon which is split across both arms. You can use a single Interact action to draw or store both integrated armaments. When you draw a single weapon, you can choose to hold it with either one hand or both hands.</p>"
