While in Bullet Dancer Stance, when you successfully Strike an opponent with a bayonet or reinforced stock attached to your firearm, the next ranged Strike you make against that opponent doesn't trigger reactions that would trigger on a ranged attack, such as Attack of Opportunity. While in Bullet Dancer Stance, when you make a successful ranged Strike against an opponent within your melee reach using a firearm, the next reinforced stock or bayonet attack attached to that firearm deals an additional [[/r 1[fire]]] damage per weapon damage die. The benefit on your next Strike from either use of Bullet Dancer Burn is lost if not used by the end of your next turn.</p>"
