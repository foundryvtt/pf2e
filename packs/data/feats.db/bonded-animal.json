You can spend 7 days of downtime trying to bond with a normal animal (not a companion or other special animal) that is friendly or helpful to you. After this duration, attempt a DC 20 Nature check. If successful, you bond with the animal. The animal is permanently helpful to you, unless you do something egregious to break your bond. A helpful animal is easier to direct. Bonding with a new animal ends any previous bond you had. You can't have both a bonded animal and an animal companion (though you can have both a bonded animal and a familiar).</p>"
