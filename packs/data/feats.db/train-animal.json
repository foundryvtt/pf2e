You can either select a basic action the animal already knows how to do (typically those listed in the Command an Animal action on page 249) or attempt to teach the animal a new basic action. The GM determines the DC of any check required and the amount of time the training takes (usually at least a week). It's usually impossible to teach an animal a trick that uses critical thinking. If you're expert, master, or legendary in Nature, you might be able to train more unusual creatures, at the GM's discretion.</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> The animal learns the action. If it was an action the animal already knew, you can Command the Animal to take that action without attempting a Nature check. If it was a new basic action, add that action to the actions the animal can take when Commanded, but you must still roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure:</strong> The animal doesn't learn the trick.</p>"
