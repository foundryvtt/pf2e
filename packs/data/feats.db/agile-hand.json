After you Sustain the Spell on future turns, you can use the tools to attempt Thievery checks to Disable a Device or Pick a Lock within the spell's range, but you take a -2 penalty to your Thievery check. If you critically fail, the spell ends and you can't use this modification again for 24 hours.</p>"
