Attempt a Diplomacy check. The DC is usually 15, though the GM might adjust it based on the circumstances. If you have expert proficiency in Diplomacy, you can instead attempt a DC 20 check to increase the Stamina Points recovered by 5; if you have master proficiency, you can attempt a DC 30 check to increase the Stamina Points by 15; if you have legendary proficiency, you can attempt a DC 40 check to increase the Stamina Points by 25. No matter the result, the ally is temporarily immune to Encouraging Words until they either @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Take a Breather]{Take a Breather} or rest for the day. <br /><br /><strong>Critical Success</strong> The ally recovers 2d8 Stamina Points.<br /><strong>Success</strong> The ally recovers 1d8 Stamina Points.<br /><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The ally takes 1d8 mental damage, but this can reduce only Stamina Points, never Hit Points.</p>"
