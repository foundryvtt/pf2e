When you gain this feat, choose one of the innate spells granted by the Lore Seeker feat: comprehend language, restore senses, or see invisibility. You can cast this spell three times per day instead of once per day. When you cast any of the spells granted by Lore Seeker as innate spells, they gain additional effects. When you cast comprehend language, the spell is heightened to 4th level. When you cast restore senses,the spell is heightened to half your level, rounded up. When you cast see invisibility, for the duration of the spell you can use an action, which has the concentrate trait, to see invisible creatures normally (instead of seeing them as translucent shapes that are concealed to you) until the end of your next turn.</p>"
