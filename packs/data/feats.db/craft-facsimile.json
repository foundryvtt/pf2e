The facsimile has the same shape and Bulk as the replaced object and can pass as the object if not examined. A creature familiar with the original who examines the object automatically realizes that it is a fake. A creature not familiar with the original can still tell it was a hastily jury-rigged stand-in of some kind, but they might not know the object was supposed to be something else.</p>"
