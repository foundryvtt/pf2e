You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against evil and necromancy spells and effects. You can sense the presence of evil undead as a pervasive taste of oily corruption in the air; this is a vague sense that allows you to know when such a creature is within 60 feet of you, though you can't precisely pinpoint their location with this sense. As normal for a vague sense, it can be fooled, but undead might not realize they need to take precautions against it. This sense also extends to living creatures who have the negative healing ability, like dhampir.</p>\n<p>You deal an additional 1 cold damage with all Strikes made with an ice-crafted weapon. If you have the Crown of the Saumen Kar feat, you deal an additional 1 cold damage with your unarmed horns Strikes.</p>"
