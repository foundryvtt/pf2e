You can make ranged mind weapon Strikes; these are ranged Strikes with a maximum range of 30 feet that deal [[/r 1d6]]{1d6} damage of the same type as your mind weapon. Your ranged mind weapon Strike gains all the benefits of your mind weapon's runes as long as they still apply to a ranged weapon. For example, if your weapon had <em>+1</em>, <em>striking</em>, and <em>spell storing</em> runes, you would get a +1 item bonus to hit with your ranged mind weapon Strike, and it would deal the additional damage from the <em>striking</em> rune, but it wouldn't be able to unleash a spell from the <em>spell storing</em> rune, as that rune can be etched onto only melee weapons.</p>"
