Snares prepared in this way don't cost you any resources to Craft. The number of snares you can prepare this way increases to four if you are a master in Crafting, and to five if you are legendary.</p>\n<p>When you Craft and deploy a snare that deals damage, any creature that critically fails its saving throw against the snare's initial effect and takes damage becomes flat-footed until the end of its next turn.</p>"
