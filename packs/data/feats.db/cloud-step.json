When you Stride, you can move across water, air, and solid surfaces that can hold only limited weight as if they were normal ground. If you Stride over a trap with a weight-sensitive pressure plate, you don't trigger it. At the end of your turn, you sink, fall, break fragile surfaces, or trigger traps as normal for your current location.</p>"
