You expend one of your spell slots to counter the triggering creature's casting of a spell with the mental trait. You lose your spell slot as if you had cast the triggering spell; this spell slot must be one for which you could Cast a Spell with the mental trait. You then attempt to counteract the triggering spell.</p>"
