When you are in a crowd or well trafficked urban area, you can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Hide]{Hide} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Sneak]{Sneak}, even when observed. On a success, you aren't hidden or undetected, but other creatures simply don't take particular notice of you, even though they can see you. You can't use this ability on observers who have already seen you perform obtrusive or notable actions. If you perform any action other than to Hide or Sneak or otherwise take particularly salient actions (GM's discretion), observers notice you right away.</p>"
