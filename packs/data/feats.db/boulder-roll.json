The foe must move even if doing so places it in harm's way. The foe can attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:resolve(10+@actor.system.skills.ath.value)]{Fortitude saving throw} against your Athletics DC to block your Step.</p>\n<p>If the foe attempts this saving throw, unless it critically succeeds, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to [[/r (@actor.level)+(@actor.abilities.str.mod)]]{your level plus your Strength modifier}. If the foe can't move into an empty space (if it is surrounded by solid objects or other creatures, for example), your Boulder Roll has no effect.</p>"
