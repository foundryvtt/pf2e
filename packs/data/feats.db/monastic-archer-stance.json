You can use your other monk feats or monk abilities that normally require unarmed attacks with these bows when attacking within half the first range increment (normally 50 feet for a longbow and 30 feet for a shortbow), so long as the feat or ability doesn't require a single, specific Strike.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> When you select this feat, you become trained in the longbow, shortbow, and any simple and martial bows with the monk trait.
