Choose a target and an ally, both of whom must be within 30 feet. The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} against the first Strike the ally makes on their next turn; if your ally doesn't Strike that target, the effect is lost. Depending on how you describe your distraction, this action gains either the auditory or visual trait.</p>"
