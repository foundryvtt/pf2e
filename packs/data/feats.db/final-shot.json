Interact to reload, expending three doses of black powder in addition to your normal black powder or ammunition, then Strike with your firearm against a creature within the weapon's first range increment. If you roll a success, the attack is instead a critical success, but if you roll a failure, the weapon misfires. Regardless of your roll, after the attack you're @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-footed} until the start of your next turn and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stunned]{Stunned 1}.</p>"
