A creature that consumes this potion is targeted by the hex.</p>\n<p>If the hex has a sustained duration and you have @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.YVK3JUkPVzHIeGXQ]{Cackle}, you can cast <em>cackle</em> into the bottle just before you seal it. If you do, the hex’s duration is extended as if you had cast <em>cackle</em> the round after the hex was cast (typically this extends the duration by 1 round). Your cackling laugh sounds out when the potion is unsealed.</p>\n<p>Any potion you create this way loses its power the next time you make your daily preparations. While the potion is in your possession, you can render it inert using a single action that has the concentrate trait. You can’t regain the Focus Point you spent to create the potion (or the Focus Point you spent to cast <em>cackle</em>) until the potion is consumed or loses its magic.</p>",
