You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level and attempt a flat check against any ongoing persistent damage, using the DC appropriate for particularly effective assistance. Using this ability depletes the magic within your bonded beast gun, preventing you from using any of its activated abilities until the end of your next turn.</p>"
