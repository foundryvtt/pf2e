When you Strike a @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} undead foe with a weapon that has the backstabber weapon trait, you deal 3 extra precision damage instead of 1. If the weapon is a +3 weapon, you deal 6 extra precision damage instead of 2. If you have the Angel of Death feat, your attacks also instantly destroy undead at 0 Hit Points, and attempts for the undead to rejuvenate-such as via a lich's soul cage or a ghost's rejuvenation ability-fail unless the effect's counteract level is higher than half your level when you killed the creature (rounded up), or originates from an artifact or deity. Finally, if you have the Assassinate feat and an undead mark critically fails its save against your Assassinate, it is destroyed.</p>"
