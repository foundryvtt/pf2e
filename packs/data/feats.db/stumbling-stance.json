The only @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strikes} you can make are stumbling swing unarmed attacks. These deal [[/r 1d8 #bludgeoning]] bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.</p>\n<p>If an enemy hits you with a melee Strike while in this stance, it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} against the next stumbling swing Strike you make against it before the end of your next turn.</p>",
