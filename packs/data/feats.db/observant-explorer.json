You sometimes notice them before they attack, or spot them nearby even if they weren't planning on attacking. You can attempt a check to notice hidden creatures attempting to Avoid Notice nearby even if you aren't actively Searching for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to notice a particular creature.</p>"
