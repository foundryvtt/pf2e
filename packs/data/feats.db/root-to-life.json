You place a small plant or similar symbol on an adjacent @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Dying]{Dying} creature, immediately stabilizing them; the creature is no longer dying and is instead @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Unconscious]{Unconscious} at 0 Hit Points.</p>\n<p>If you spend 2 actions instead of 1, you empower the act further by uttering a quick folk blessing to chase away ongoing pain, adding the auditory trait to the action. When you do so, attempt flat checks to remove each source of persistent damage affecting the target; due to the particularly effective assistance, the DC is 10 instead of the usual 15.</p>"
