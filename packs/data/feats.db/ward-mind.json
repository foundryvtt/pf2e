Until the end of your next turn, you ignore a single mental effect that meets the requirement. You can suppress a particular effect using Ward Mind or Cognitive Loophole only once, even if you have both feats.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can use this reaction even if the mental effect prevents you from using reactions.</p>"
