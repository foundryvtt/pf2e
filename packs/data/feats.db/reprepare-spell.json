You can spend 10 minutes to prepare a spell that you already cast today, regaining access to that spell slot. The spell must be of 4th level or lower and one that does not have a duration. You can reprepare a spell in this way even if you've already reprepared that spell previously in the same day.</p>\n<p>If you have the @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Spell Substitution]{Spell Substitution} arcane thesis, you can instead prepare a different spell in an expended slot, as long as the new spell doesn't have a duration. Once you've reprepared a spell in that slot even once, you can use your arcane thesis to substitute only spells without durations into that spell slot.</p>"
