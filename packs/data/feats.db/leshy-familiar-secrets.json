You can select one additional familiar ability each day, which must be one of the following leshy familiar abilities. You can’t select more than one leshy familiar ability at a time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Grasping Tendrils</strong> Your familiar can extend vines or similar tendrils, increasing its reach to 15 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Purify Air</strong> Your familiar recycles air, providing enough oxygen for a Medium creature in areas with stale air, such as a sealed chamber or extradimensional space. If the leshy is within the area of an inhaled poison effect or an effect that relies on smell, creatures within a 15-foot emanation from the leshy gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their saving throws against the effect.</li>\n<li><strong>Verdant Burst</strong> When your familiar dies,it releases its primal energy to cast the 3-action version of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-pack=\"pf2e.spells-srd\" data-id=\"rfZpqmj0AIIdkVIs\" draggable=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Heal</a>, heightened to a level 1 lower than your highest-level spell slot. The <em>heal</em> spell gains a status bonus equal to twice the spell’s level to the Hit Points it restores to plants. You must be able to cast 2nd-level spells using spell slots to select this familiar ability.</li>\n</ul>",
