In wilderness regions, you also increase your Perception DC by 1 against these types of creatures for the purposes of resolving their Stealth checks. If you're master in Survival, this circumstance bonus increases to +2.</p>\n<p>If you know the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Commune with Nature]{Commune with Nature}</em> ritual, you can use Survival as a primary or secondary check to resolve that ritual-if you do so, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus.</p>"
