The space functions as a bag of holding, but can hold only up to 5 Bulk, has no Bulk of its own, and can be Interacted with using only one hand.</p>\n<p>In addition, when you Palm an Object, you can place it directly into this extradimensional space as long as the space has sufficient free space to hold the object.</p>"
