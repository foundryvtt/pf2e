Compare the result of your attack roll to the AC of the triggering foe. On a hit, you deal the normal amount of damage for your Strike, but the damage type changes to that of the triggering attack.</p>\n<p>For instance, if you used Opportune Riposte to deflect a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Ray of Frost]{Ray of Frost}</em>, your Strike would deal cold damage instead of its normal damage type.</p>"
