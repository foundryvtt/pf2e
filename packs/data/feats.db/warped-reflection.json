It must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Frightened]{Frightened 1} (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Frightened]{Frightened 2} on a critical failure) and be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} as long as the frightened condition lasts.
