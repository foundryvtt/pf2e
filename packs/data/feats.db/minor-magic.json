Choose arcane, divine, occult, or primal magic, and gain two cantrips from the common cantrips that are available in that tradition. Your key spellcasting ability is Charisma, and you're trained in spell attack rolls and DCs for the tradition of your chosen cantrips.</p>\n<p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Cast a Spell]{Cast a Spell} activity. These spells work similarly to the ones you get from multiclass dedication feats for spellcasting classes. However, you don't gain a spell repertoire, spellbook, or similar, so your oddball rogue magic doesn't let you use abilities that require those.</p>"
