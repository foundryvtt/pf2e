If you used Tag Team after your spotter missed the triggering Strike, make a ranged Strike against the same target with a -2 penalty. If you used this reaction after you missed the triggering Strike, your spotter can use their reaction to make a melee or ranged Strike against the same target. Strikes granted by this feat don't count toward your or your spotter's multiple attack penalty and your or your spotter's multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to the granted Strike.</p>"
