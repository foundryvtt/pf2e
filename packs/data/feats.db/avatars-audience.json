When you cast it this way, its casting time is 1 minute, your religious symbol is a sufficient tuning fork for this spell, and you appear exactly where you want to be. If you're in your deity's realm due to this spell, you can return to the point you left when you cast it by spending a single action, which has the concentrate and divine traits.</p>"
