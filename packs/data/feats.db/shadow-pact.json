You can take 1 damage to mix blood and shadows to cast 5th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Creation]{Creation}</em> as an innate divine spell. You can use this ability as often as you wish, but you can have only one such object in existence at a time. If the object encounters bright light, the spell ends and the object dissolves into shadows.</p>"
