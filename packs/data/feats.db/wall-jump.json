Furthermore, since your previous jump gives you momentum, you can use High Jump or Long Jump as a single action, but you don't get to Stride as part of the activity.</p>\n<p>You can use Wall Jump only once in a turn, unless you're legendary in Athletics, in which case you can use Wall Jump as many times as you can use consecutive jump actions in that turn.</p>"
