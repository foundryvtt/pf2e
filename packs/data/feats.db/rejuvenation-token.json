As long as this object is intact, even if your body is destroyed, you can be restored to the exact state you were in the last time you made daily preparations with this object in your possession. The soulbound object can be used as a special focus for <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Raise Dead]{Raise Dead}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Resurrect]{Resurrect}</em>, or similar magic. This warps the spell to bring you back in your skeletal undead state rather than bringing you back to life. Pharasma can't prevent you from returning when the spell is modified in this way.</p>\n<p>When you return, you permanently lose a memory that was precious to you, in addition to any other side effects of the spell that brought you back. Your soulbound object becomes inert until you spend 1 week of downtime to anchor yourself to it again, further fragmenting your mind.</p>"
