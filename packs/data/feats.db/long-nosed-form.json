Due to your imperfect transformation, your transformation doesn't automatically defeat Perception DCs to determine whether you are human, though you may be able to explain away or hide your tengu traits.</p>\n<p>You lose your beak unarmed Strike in your human form, as well as any other unarmed Strikes you gained from a tengu heritage or ancestry feat. You can remain in your human form indefinitely, and you can shift back to your tengu form by using this action again.</p>"
