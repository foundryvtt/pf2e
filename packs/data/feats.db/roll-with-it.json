Your foe can move you any distance of its choice up to 30 feet in a direction of its choice (this is not forced movement, and it triggers reactions as normal). You fall @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Prone]{Prone} and are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Stunned]{Stunned 1}. Attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:6]. On a success, you take minimum damage from the attack, and on a critical success, if the attack was a critical hit, you don't take double damage from the critical hit.</p>"
