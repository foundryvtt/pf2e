If you succeed at your check (or checks) against an observer's DC, that observer doesn't notice you're Casting a Spell, even though material, somatic, and verbal components are usually noticeable and spells normally have sensory manifestations that would make spellcasting obvious to those nearby.</p>\n<p>This ability hides only the spell's spellcasting actions and manifestations, not its effects, so an observer might still see a ray streak out from you or see you vanish into thin air.</p>"
