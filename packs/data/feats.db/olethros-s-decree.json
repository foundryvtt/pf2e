You place a finger on fate’s scales by wrapping silk around your bow. The first time this turn that you hit a creature with a Strike using a weapon in the bow group you’ve modified in this way, that creature takes an additional [[/r 60]] damage (basic Fortitude save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher) as the arrow works to cut short their very destiny. This additional damage is of the same type as the initial attack dealt. If you hit more than one creature at the same time, choose one to suffer the effect of your decree.</p>"
