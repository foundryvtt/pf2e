When in the presence of an aura of chaos that is powerful or overwhelming, you eventually detect the aura, though you might not do so instantly and you can't pinpoint the location. This is a vague sense, similar to humans' sense of smell. A chaotic creature using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence attempts a Deception check against your Perception DC to hide its aura from you. If the creature succeeds at its Deception check, it is temporarily immune to your Sense Chaos for 1 day.</p>"
