You can spend up to 3 additional batches of @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Infused Reagents]{Infused Reagents} when creating this item to stabilize it.</p>\n<p>Upon activating the item, attempt a DC 10 flat check; for every additional batch of @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Infused Reagents]{Infused Reagents} you spent to create the item, reduce this DC by 2. On a success, the item functions normally. On a failure, the item explodes, dealing force damage to the user equal to twice the item's level (doubled on a critical failure).</p>"
