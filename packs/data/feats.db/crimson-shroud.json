You can Interact with your shroud, swirling it around you, to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the beginning of your next turn. Finally, if you die while the shroud is active, you can choose to have your entire body vanish into red mist, leaving behind only your gear; you make this choice when you activate Crimson Shroud.</p>"
