You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks against devils and saving throws against their abilities. In addition, whenever you meet a devil in a social situation, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a -5 penalty to the check. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.<br /><br /><strong>Special</strong> If you have the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Glad-Hand]{Glad-Hand} skill feat, you don't take the penalty to your immediate Diplomacy check if the target is a devil.</p>"
