You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, and your target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} against your attacks while you are sharing its space in this way. If any creature other than your target hits you with an attack roll while you are sharing your target’s space, attempt a DC 15 flat check. On a success, resolve the attack against the target instead of you, using the same attack roll result that hit you.</p>"
