At any point in the Leap, you can make a single Strike against a creature within your reach. At 12th level, if you hit with this Strike, instead of finishing your Leap, you can immediately attempt a second Leap from the space where you struck the target of your Strike. You can make a single Strike against a target within your reach during this second Leap as well. At 16th level, you can attempt a third Leap if your second Strike hits, and you can attack a target at any point during this third Leap. All Leaps made during this activity gain a +10-foot status bonus to the total height or distance of your leap, and no two Strikes can target the same creature.</p>",
