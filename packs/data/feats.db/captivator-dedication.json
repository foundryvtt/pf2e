Choose Deception or Diplomacy. You become trained in that skill, or become an expert if you were already trained.</p>\n<p>Choose two cantrips from the occult list; each cantrip must be from either the enchantment or illusion school. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity and can cast these spells as occult innate spells. You're trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs. If you have a hand free, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the captivator archetype.</p>"
