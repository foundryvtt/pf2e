Each enemy you reduced to 0 Hit Points dies and its head explodes. Each exploding head generates a shockwave in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:15] around that enemy. Each creature in any of the emanations takes [[/r 10d6[bludgeoning]]] damage with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.spellDC.value)|basic:true]. If this damage reduces an enemy to 0 Hit Points, its head also explodes, potentially damaging more creatures and potentially causing more detonations. A given creature can take damage only once from a single use of Cranial Detonation.</p>"
