Both Strikes must have the same target. If the second Strike is made with a weapon that doesn't have the agile trait, it takes a -2 penalty.</p>\n<p>If both attacks hit, combine their damage, and then add any other applicable effects from both weapons. You add any precision damage only once, to the attack of your choice. Combine the damage from both Strikes and apply resistances and weaknesses only once. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty.</p>"
