Give your new fused stance a unique name. When you enter your fused stance, you gain all the effects of both stances, including the requirements and restrictions. You can't fuse stances with fundamentally incompatible requirements or restrictions (such as @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Mountain Stance]{Mountain Stance} and @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Crane Stance]{Crane Stance}, which both require using only one type of Strike).</p>"
