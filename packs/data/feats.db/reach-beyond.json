You can make melee Strikes against incorporeal creatures that are inside solid objects as long as the object is within your reach. An incorporeal creature inside of a solid object is hidden, requiring you to succeed at a DC 11 flat check when you target it. You can spend an action, which has the concentrate trait, to focus on a creature inside of a solid object. If you do, the next melee Strike you make this turn requires you to succeed at only a DC 6 flat check to affect the creature.</p>"
