These items have no resale value, and they naturally degrade after 24 hours without regular (if minor) maintenance. You can maintain up to 10 such items at a time; if you create a new one, your oldest creation breaks down from neglect.</p>\n<p>These temporary items take you only 1 day to Craft instead of 4. If you're an expert in Crafting, you can Craft these items in 1 hour; if you're a master, you can Craft them in 10 minutes; if you're legendary, you can Craft them in 1 minute.</p>"
