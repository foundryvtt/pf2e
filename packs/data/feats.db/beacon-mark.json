While the spell lasts, you can spend a single action, which has the concentrate, detection, and divination traits, to attempt to locate the target, learning the direction to the target as long as you are within 1 mile of it. If the target is a creature or a creature is in possession of the target object, the creature can attempt a Will saving throw against your spell DC. If it succeeds, your attempt to locate the target fails and you can't attempt this again for 1 day. You can only have a single target marked with a sigil modified in this way. If you Cast this Spell again on a second target, the sigil spell on the first target ends, and your mark fades.</p>"
