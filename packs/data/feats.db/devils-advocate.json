You take a -5 penalty to the check. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> If you have the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Glad-Hand]{Glad-Hand} skill feat, you don't take the penalty to your immediate Diplomacy check if the target is a devil.</p>"
