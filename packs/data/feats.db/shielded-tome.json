When the item is in book form, you can read the book and Raise the Tome, and when it's in shield form, you can Raise the Shield, Activate it, and gain any other benefits or effects the shield normally has (such as a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Spellguard Shield]{Spellguard Shield's} bonus to saving throws against magic).</p>\n<p>The fusion lasts until your next daily preparations.</p>"
