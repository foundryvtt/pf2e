If you hit and deal damage, the target takes one of the following effects, based on the body part you targeted. The GM should use the stated effects as a guideline when attacking creatures with stranger anatomy-for instance, applying the “arms” effect to a creature's tentacles if those are what the creature uses to attack.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arms</strong> The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 2} until the end of your next turn. On a critical hit, it's also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} for 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Head</strong> The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 2} until the end of your next turn. On a critical hit, it's also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Legs</strong> The target takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speeds until the end of your next turn. On a critical hit, it also takes a -5-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Wings</strong> If the target is flying using its wings, it immediately falls 20 feet, or 40 feet on a critical hit. The fall is gradual enough that if the target hits the ground, it takes no damage from the fall.</li>\n</ul>"
