You gain resistance equal to your level to the triggering damage type, which applies against the triggering damage.</p>\n<p>If you have the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Crystalline Dust]{Crystalline Dust} feat, you can use Preemptive Reconfiguration without expending a usage of the reaction for the purpose of the feat's Frequency limit.
