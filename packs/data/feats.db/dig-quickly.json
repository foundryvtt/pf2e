You dig a shallow pit in the square you currently occupy, turning the square into difficult terrain (including for you). In addition, you also kick up a cloud of grit in a direction of your choice. The cloud extinguishes small, unattended, non-magical fires and helps smother the flames on burning creatures located within the cone; creatures in this cone that are taking @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Persistent Damage]{Persistent fire Damage} can immediately attempt an additional flat DC 15 check to end the persistent damage.</p>"
