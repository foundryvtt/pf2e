As long as you are suffering @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Persistent Damage]{Persistent Fire Damage}, all your melee attacks against adjacent creatures deal an additional 1 fire damage per weapon damage die. Any creature that successfully @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Grapple]{Grapples}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Shove]{Shoves}, or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Trip]{Trips} you takes 1d6 fire damage; if it uses a weapon for that action, the weapon takes the damage instead.
