You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to both Perception checks and saving throws against fey. In addition, whenever you meet a fey creature in a social situation, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a -5 penalty to the check. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> If you have the Glad-Hand skill feat, you don't take the penalty on your immediate Diplomacy check if the target is a fey.</p>"
