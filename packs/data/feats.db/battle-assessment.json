The GM might apply a penalty for the distance between you and the enemy.

If the event of a tie, the GM should pick one at random.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The GM chooses one piece of information from the above list to tell you about the enemy.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The GM gives you false information (the GM makes up the information).</p>"
