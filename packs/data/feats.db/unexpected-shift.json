Roll a DC 16 flat check. On a success, you gain resistance to all damage equal to your level against the triggering effect, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against that effect until the start of your turn, and you gain the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} condition for 1 round.</p>",
