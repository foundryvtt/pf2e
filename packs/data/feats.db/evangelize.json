Attempt a Diplomacy check and compare the result to the Will DC of a single target that can hear you and understands your language; that target is then temporarily immune to Evangelize with respect to your deity or philosophy for 1 day. A creature that already agrees with you is unaffected, and at the GM’s discretion, a target that genuinely changes its perspective to support your faith as a result of the argument is also otherwise unaffected.<br><br><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied} 2 for 1 round.<br><strong>Success</strong> The target is stupefied 1 for 1 round.<br><strong>Failure</strong> The target is unaffected.&nbsp;</p>",
