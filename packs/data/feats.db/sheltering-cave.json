At the end of this time, the earth rises and opens, forming a small cave or earthen mound 20 feet in diameter and 10 feet high. This cave has the structure trait and the same restrictions as structures created by magic items. The cave has a single entrance and provides shelter from the elements.</p>\n<p>The cave remains for 12 hours or until you spend 10 minutes coaxing the earth to close.</p>"
