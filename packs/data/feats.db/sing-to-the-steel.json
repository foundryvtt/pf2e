You and your allies within 30 feet gain the effects of one of the following runes until the end of your next turn: @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Corrosive]{Corrosive}, @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Disrupting]{Disrupting}, @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Flaming]{Flaming}, @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Frost]{Frost}, @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Ghost Touch]{Ghost Touch}, @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Shock]{Shock}, or @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Thundering]{Thundering}. The effects apply to a single weapon the creature is holding or one of the creature's unarmed attacks. You choose the rune and the effect applies to all creatures. You can use an action, which has the concentrate trait, to extend the duration of the rune for 1 additional round up to a maximum of 1 minute. If this would give a weapon or unarmed attack more property runes than its normal maximum, an existing property rune (as the creature chooses) is suppressed until the spell ends.</p>"
