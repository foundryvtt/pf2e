When you cast an enchantment spell that targets one creature and that creature critically succeeds at its Will save, you can Cast the Spell again before the end of your next turn on a different creature without expending an additional spell slot. The second casting doesn't grant you any benefits that you would normally gain for Casting a Spell from a spell slot.</p>"
