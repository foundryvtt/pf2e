Once per hour, when you critically fail a check, you can reroll the check as a free action; this is a fortune effect. Additionally, you can choose to automatically succeed at checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Earn Income]{Earn Income} for tasks below your level, without rolling. However, when you die, your soul is consigned to Hell. You can't be returned to life except by powerful magic such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Miracle]{Miracle}</em>, and even then, the devils responsible for the contract can track your every move for 1 year. The devils gain the effects of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Discern Location]{Discern Location}</em> spell. They can also use 10th-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Scrying]{Scrying}</em> on you at will, and you automatically critically fail your saving throw.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't retrain out of a Pact of Infernal Prowess without journeying to Hell and destroying the devil's written contract spelling out the terms of your pact.</p>"
