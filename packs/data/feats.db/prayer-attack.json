If your Feint is successful, when you use Prayer Attack on subsequent turns you automatically make the target flat-footed against your melee attacks for that turn without rolling a check to Feint, so as long as you remain visible to the target and the target remains within 30 feet of you. If you use your Prayer Attack against a different target, you must attempt to Feint the target normally.</p>\n<p>When you use Prayer Attack, your next successful Strike with a sawtooth saber that turn deals @Localize[PF2E.PersistentDamage.Bleed2d6.success] to the target.</p>"
