Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare four snares from your formula book for quick deployment; if they normally take 1 minute to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Craft]{Craft}, you can Craft them with 3 @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Interact]{Interact} actions. The number of snares increases to six if you're a master in Crafting and eight if you're legendary.</p>\n<p>Snares prepared in this way don't cost you any resources to Craft.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> The feat counts as @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Snare Specialist]{Snare Specialist} for the purpose of feat prerequisites. If you also have the Snare Specialist ranger feat, the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Quick Snares]{Quick Snares} from both feats are cumulative. You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the snarecrafter archetype.</p>"
