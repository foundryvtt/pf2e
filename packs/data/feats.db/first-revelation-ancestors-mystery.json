Use the minor curse from your mystery, but when you progress it again, instead of your mystery's moderate curse effect, you become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} in addition to the effects of the minor curse.</p>\n<p>If you don't have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Refocus]{Refocus} by reconciling the conflicting nature of your mystery, which also reduces your curse to minor.</p>\n<h4>Minor Curse of Ancestors</h4>\n<p>One of your ancestors becomes predominant in their meddling. The first time you gain this effect each day, roll [[/r 1d4]] on the list below to determine which type of ancestor becomes predominant. This predominant ancestor guides you to use their preferred type of action.</p>\n<p>When you try to use one of the types of actions listed for the other ancestors, you must succeed at a <span data-pf2-check=\"flat\" data-pf2-dc=\"4\">DC 4 flat check</span>. On a failure, you spend the action but gain no effect (though you don't lose the spell if you were Casting a Spell). If your action would take 1 minute or longer, it's long enough that you can overcome the meddling, and you don't need to attempt a flat check.</p>\n<p>During combat or another tense, round-by-round encounter, other ancestors wrestle for control of your actions. When you roll initiative, and then at the end of each of your turns during the encounter, roll [[/r 1d4]] and change your predominant ancestor appropriately. Once the encounter ends, you return to the influence of the ancestor you first rolled for the day.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.feature-effects.Effect: Minor Martial Ancestor Curse]{Effect: Minor Martial Ancestor Curse}, @Compendium[pf2e.feature-effects.Effect: Minor Skillful Ancestor Curse]{Effect: Minor Skillful Ancestor Curse}, @Compendium[pf2e.feature-effects.Effect: Minor Spellcaster Ancestor Curse]{Effect: Minor Spellcaster Ancestor Curse}</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>ANCESTRAL INFLUENCE</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Martial Ancestor, Preferred action Strikes</li>\n<li>Skillful Ancestor, Preferred action Perception and Skill actions</li>\n<li>Spellcasting Ancestor, Preferred action Cast a Spell</li>\n<li>You choose which ancestor guides your actions</li>\n</ol>"
