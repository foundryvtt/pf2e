Reality buckles and twists under your sudden power—each tiefling has a unique transformation, but it might include sulfurous flames, choruses of shrieks, or twisting, serpentine lightning. Every creature within 10 feet of you is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Deafened]{Deafened} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Dazzled]{Dazzled} for 1 round unless they succeed at a Fortitude save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Your final form has the effects of @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Divine Vessel]{Divine Vessel} for a deity that shares an alignment with your fiendish lineage. Your final form resembles a creature from your fiendish lineage, and you remain in that form for 1 minute. While in your final form, you can cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Chilling Darkness]{Chilling Darkness}, @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Fireball]{Fireball}, and @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Lightning Bolt]{Lightning Bolt} as 6th-level divine innate spells, once each per use of this feat.</p>\n<p>When you emerge from your final form, you become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Drained]{Drained} 3. In addition, if you have this feat, you gain weakness 10 to good even when not in your final form, and you take good damage even if you aren’t evil.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> At the GM’s discretion, the specific elements of this feat can be adjusted to better fit the tiefling’s lineage—for example, a GM might decide that a particular beastbrood tiefling could cast a 6th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Phantasmal Killer]{Phantasmal Killer}<em> instead of fireball.</em></p>"
