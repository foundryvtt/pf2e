If you do, the shield prevents that ally from taking damage instead of you, following the normal rules for a Shield Block.<br /><br />If an undead makes an attack against an ally within 10 feet, you can Step to become adjacent to your ally and then use Shield Block as part of the same reaction.</p>"
