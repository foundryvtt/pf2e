You reduce your shield boss and shield spikes weapon damage die to 1d4. As long as the weapon damage die is 1d4, your shield boss and shield spike Strikes gain the agile weapon trait. You can use Agile Shield Grip again to switch to a normal grip, returning the damage to the usual amount and removing the agile trait.</p>"
