Make a crossbow or firearm Strike against a foe who's observed or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} to you (but not undetected). The ammunition travels to your target in a straight line, passing through any non-magical barriers or walls in its way, though magical barriers and force effects stop the bullet. The shot ignores all cover, the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Concealed]{Concealed} condition, the hidden condition, and circumstance bonuses to AC from shields. It has a +4 status bonus to hit creatures wearing any type of armor. The Strike's damage can't be reduced with a Shield Block reaction using a non-magical shield.</p>"
