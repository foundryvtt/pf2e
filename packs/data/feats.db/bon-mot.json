This can either be a single action that has the concentrate trait or an appropriate skill action to frame their retort. The GM <br />determines which skill actions qualify, though they must <br />take at least 1 action. Typically, the retort needs to use a linguistic Charisma-based skill action.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the penalty is -2.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your quip is atrocious. You take the same <br />penalty an enemy would take had you succeeded. This ends <br />after 1 minute or if you issue another Bon Mot and succeed.</p>"
