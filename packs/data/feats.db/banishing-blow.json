You attempt an Athletics check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Shove]{Shove} the fiend that triggered your champion's reaction; on a success, the target can't teleport or summon creatures for 1 minute. On a critical success, the target is also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stunned]{Stunned 1} and can't teleport or summon creatures for 1 hour, and if you are on your home plane and the target is a fiend of level 18 or lower from another plane, it is also banished to its home plane. Your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this attack.</p>"
