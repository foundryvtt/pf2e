Reduce the damage you take from the triggering Strike by 2 + your level. Your adjacent undead companion loses a number of Hit Points equal to the amount of damage reduced. If you have more than one adjacent undead companion, you choose which one loses Hit Points. You can't divert the damage to a temporary fragment from @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Their Master's Call]{Their Master's Call}.</p>"
