You become momentarily @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} from the triggering attack if vision is the attacker's only precise sense. Normally this means the attacker must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:11|name:Hidden Flat Check|traits:hidden|showDC:owner] check to target you. You also gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack.</p>"
