These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the forceful, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.</p>\n<p>While in Mountain Stance, you gain a +4 item bonus to AC and a +2 circumstance bonus to any defenses against being Shoved or Tripped. You have a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +0, meaning you don't add your Dexterity to your AC, and your Speeds are all reduced by 5 feet. The item bonus to AC from Mountain Stance is cumulative with armor potency runes on your @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Clothing (Explorer's)]{Clothing (Explorer's)}, @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Mage Armor]{Mage Armor}, and bracers of armor.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.pf2e-macros.Toggle Mountain Stance]{Toggle Mountain Stance}</p>"
