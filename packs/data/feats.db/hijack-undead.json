It can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC to resist being controlled by you. If the target is already under someone else's command, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw, and the undead uses the better result.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected and temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The undead creature becomes a minion under your control for 1 minute.
