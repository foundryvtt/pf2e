Attempt a DC 40 Medicine check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Raise Dead]{Raise Dead}, except it still has the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Wounded]{Wounded} condition it had before @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Dying]{Dying}, increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day.</p>"
