As long as the majority of the deck remains in your possession, any cards that are lost or thrown can be found after 1 minute. Otherwise, the remaining cards are likely lost or destroyed.</p>\n<p>A character who has this feat can enchant a single deck of playing cards as a magic weapon, etching fundamental and property runes directly onto the deck of cards.</p>"
