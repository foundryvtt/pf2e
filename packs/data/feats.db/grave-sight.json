            "value": "<p>Your ability to sense undead has improved. You sense undead as an imprecise sense with a range of 60 feet: an uncomfortable sensation brushes against your spirit and stinks of rot. When in proximity to an undead, you can sense its presence, but it has the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} condition instead of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Observed]{Observed} condition. An undead using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence must attempt a Deception or Stealth check against your Perception DC to hide its presence from you. If the creature succeeds, it's undetected, and you have to use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} basic action to detect the creature. As with hearing and other imprecise senses, you still need to Seek to locate an undetected creature.</p>"
