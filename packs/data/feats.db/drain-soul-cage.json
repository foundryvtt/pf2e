Your soul cage doesn't need to be on your person for you to use Drain Bonded Item. If your soul cage is broken or destroyed, you can't use Drain Soul Cage. Even if you can Drain Bonded Item more than once per day, for instance if you are a universalist wizard, you can still only choose a spell you haven't prepared and cast once per day.</p>"
