            "value": "<p>You've attuned your natural aura to that of plant life, coaxing it to grow faster than normal. You sit for 10 minutes with a small, natural non-creature plant-such as a lone flower, a small bush, or a potted succulent-while you bring your aura in tune through meditation. You coax the plant to advance one stage in its life cycle: from seed to sprout, sprout to plant, plant to flower, or flower to fruit. If the plant doesn't have proper nutrients (if you're sprouting a seed without soil or water, for example), the plant withers 5 minutes after you complete the activity. Performing this activity more than once per day renders you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Fatigued]{Fatigued} and unable to use Morphic Manipulation until your next full night's rest.</p>"
