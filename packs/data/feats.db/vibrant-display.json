Once every 10 minutes, when you use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Feint]{Feint} action, you can compare your Deception check result to the Perception DCs of all adjacent creatures rather than just one creature within melee reach. It's possible to get a different degree of success for each target.<br /><br />These changes are imprecise and usually short-lived, so while they allow you to periodically change your appearance in unpredictable ways, they are of little use in providing camouflage or aiding a disguise.</p>"
