A character who attempts to Point Out your location must attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:14]. If they fail, their allies misunderstand them and aren't sure where you are. On a critical failure, their allies think they pointed you out in a different location entirely, chosen by the GM. Similarly, when a creature critically fails to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} you while you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} to or undetected by it, it thinks you're in a different location chosen by the GM. In either case, you appear to be hidden to a creature that thinks you're in a different location, though you're actually undetected by it for targeting and further uses of the Seek action.</p>"
