You can spend 10 minutes assessing the area around you to find out what creatures are nearby, based on nests, scat, and marks on vegetation. Attempt a Survival check against a DC determined by the GM based on how obvious the signs are. On a success, you can attempt a Recall Knowledge check with a -2 penalty to learn more about the creatures just from these signs. If you're a master in Survival, you don't take the penalty.</p>"
