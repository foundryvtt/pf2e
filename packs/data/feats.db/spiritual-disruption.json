If the attack hits, any time the target attempts to cast a divine or occult spell, the spell is disrupted unless they succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] (@Check[type:flat|dc:7] on a critical hit); if the target is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied}, it must attempt the harder of the two flat checks (but not both). This effect lasts for 1 minute.</p>"
