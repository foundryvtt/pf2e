The prison is a sphere made of unmelting ice, just large enough to fit your target. The target, and any creatures sharing its space, must attempt a Reflex save, with a DC using the higher of your class DC and spell DC. A creature that fails becomes trapped inside the prison. If it succeeds, the creature is pushed outside the prison into a space of its choice. If the target shares its space with a gargantuan creature, the effect fails.</p>\n<p>The dome has AC 10, Hardness 20, and 40 Hit Points; it's immune to cold, critical hits, and precision damage. The prison lasts until destroyed, until you use this ability to create a new prison, or until you die.</p>"
