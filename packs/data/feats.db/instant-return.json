Interact to load the projectile into your weapon, then make a Strike with the required weapon against the triggering opponent. Since you're using the foe's ammunition, this Strike applies any special effects that ammunition would have (for instance, if it was @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Explosive Ammunition]{Explosive Ammunition}, it would explode in a burst of fire if your Strike hits).</p>"
