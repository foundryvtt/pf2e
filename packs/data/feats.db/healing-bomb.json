You grant the elixir the bomb trait.</p>\n<p>If you throw an elixir of life bomb at a willing target, you hit even on a failure, though not on a critical failure. If your Strike with this elixir bomb hits a living target, the target regains Hit Points as if it had consumed the elixir. On a critical success, the target also gains the elixir's item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 1 minute.</p>"
