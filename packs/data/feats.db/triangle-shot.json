This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty, and you combine the attacks' damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>Your @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Stunning Fist]{Stunning Fist} benefit applies to Triangle Shot, even though it isn't a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Flurry of Blows]{Flurry of Blows}.
