Make a melee Strike against a target creature. If it hits, in addition to taking damage from the Strike, the target is affected by a 10th-level casting of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Power Word Kill]{Power Word Kill}</em>. If Wrath of the First Ghoul is used against a target elf, Leng ghoul, or worshipper of Pharasma and does not instantly kill the creature, the target takes double damage.</p>"
