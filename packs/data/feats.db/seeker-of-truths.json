You gain the cleric's @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Domain Initiate]{Domain Initiate} feat but must select knowledge, secrecy, or truth as your domain. You cast that domain's domain spell as a focus spell of the same tradition as your cantrip from Eldritch Researcher Dedication, and you Refocus by contemplating abstruse mysteries rather than praying to a god. When an ability would manifest a divine symbol—such as the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Word of Truth]{Word of Truth}</em> focus spell—it instead manifests as a strange shape unique to you that seems to defy geometry.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can take this feat up to three times, selecting a different domain each time.</p>"
