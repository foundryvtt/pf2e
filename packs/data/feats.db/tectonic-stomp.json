You raise up to three stone chunks from the ground in unoccupied squares in the emanation; the stones can't be adjacent to one another. The chunks are 5 feet tall, block movement, and are large enough to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Take Cover]{Take Cover} behind. They have AC 10, Hardness 8, and Hit Points equal to your level. They are immune to critical hits and precision damage. A stone chunk crumbles away when it has 0 Hit Points, and all of them crumble after 1 minute or when you use Tectonic Stomp again.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Awakening</strong> Your stomp rattles those who fail horribly.
