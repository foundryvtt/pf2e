You can draw power from your magical equipment to replenish your health. You drain one of your invested items, in the process regaining Hit Points equal to double the item's level. In addition, you can attempt a counteract check with a total bonus equal to 10 + the drained item's level against one effect that gave you the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Drained]{Drained}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Doomed]{Doomed}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Fatigued]{Fatigued}, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Slowed]{Slowed} condition. If you succeed, you reduce the chosen condition's value by 1. An item drained by this action becomes non-magical until the next time you make your daily preparations.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for human, goblin for goblin, etc.).</p>"
