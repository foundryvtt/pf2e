Your @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Advanced Alchemy]{Advanced Alchemy} level for creating these is 1 and doesn't increase on its own.</p>\n<p>You become an expert in Nature and can use Nature instead of Crafting to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Craft]{Craft} herbal items. You don't need to be trained in Crafting or have the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Alchemical Crafting]{Alchemical Crafting} feat to do so, and you can use @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Healer's Tools]{Healer's Tools} instead of @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Alchemist's Tools]{Alchemist's Tools}.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the herbalist archetype.</p>"
