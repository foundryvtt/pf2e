You can add your resistance from this feat to the resistance you gain from Elemental Bulwark against effects with your elements’ traits, for a total of 5 + half your level, or 10 + half your level with Improved Elemental Bulwark. If you take the Tetraelemental Assault feat, you can choose each of your two elements twice each, instead of choosing each of the four elements once each.</p>"
