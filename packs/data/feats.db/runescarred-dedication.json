You might have possessed these marks before gaining the archetype, but you only truly became runescarred when you chose to study and tap into the runes' power. You become an expert in Arcana and you also become trained in Thassilon Lore, or an expert in Thassilon Lore if you were already trained in it.</p>\n<p>Choose one cantrip from the arcane list. One of the runes on your body corresponds to the chosen cantrip, and you can cast the chosen cantrip as an innate arcane spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the runescarred archetype.</p>"
