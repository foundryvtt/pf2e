Whenever you would gain a benefit from a psychic amp, you can have the amp affect the tethered creature instead. You can do so only if the amp grants a distinct benefit, not if it alters the amped spell. The tether can't be severed physically but breaks if the distance between you and the tethered ally ever exceeds 60 feet, if you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Unconscious]{Unconscious}, or if you use Astral Tether again.</p>"
