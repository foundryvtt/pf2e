Additionally, you keep a book of arcane spells similar to a wizard's spellbook.

During your daily preparations, choose any one spell from your book of arcane spells. If it isn't in your spell repertoire, add it to your spell repertoire until the next time you prepare. If it's already in your spell repertoire, add it as an additional signature spell for that day.</p>"
