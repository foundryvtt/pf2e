If there's a foe in the chosen square, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Strike]{Strike} that foe with the required weapon. Then attempt to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Trip]{Trip} every foe in the chosen square plus each square adjacent to that square, ignoring Trip's requirement that you have a hand free. This counts as three attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made the Strike, if any, and all the Trip attempts.</p>"
