Ignore the reduction to your Speed from any armor you wear. In addition, any time you're taking a penalty to your Speed from some other reason (such as from the encumbered condition or from a spell), deduct 5 feet from the penalty. For example, the encumbered condition normally gives a -10-foot penalty to Speed, but it gives you only a -5-foot penalty. If your Speed is taking multiple penalties, pick only one penalty to reduce.</p>"
