The next time within the next minute the creature would be affected by that condition, your treatment immediately attempts to reduce the condition value with the effects of Treat Condition, using the secret roll result for the check. Preventative Treatment lasts on a creature for 1 minute, until the treatment is used, or until you use Preventative Treatment again on that creature, whichever comes first.</p>"
