Attempt the triggering check again, using the second result. On a success, you gain the normal results of the check, plus you feel invigorated by your stunt and gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level (double your level on a critical success). You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute. Typically, a challenging task is one with at least a standard DC for your level, though the difficulty may be higher depending on the situation. A meaningful context is one where the action's success or failure is relevant to the pursuit of your goals.</p>"
