So long as this token is in your possession, when you tie an adversary's initiative roll, you go first.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> If you select this feat at 1st level, you receive your pilgrim's token for free. Alternately, if you have a religious symbol, it is already attuned, as described above.</p>\n<p>If you select this feat at a later level, or if you lose your pilgrim's token, you must purchase or Craft a replacement and attune it at a holy site. Such a token usually costs at least 2 sp, and the attunement takes 10 minutes of prayer and requires a successful DC 20 Religion check. Your GM might adjust the price and DC depending on the token's material and quality and the religious significance of the site; the more significant the location, the easier the attunement.</p>"
