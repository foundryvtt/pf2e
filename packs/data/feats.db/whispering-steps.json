Use this amp in place of the psi cantrip's normal amp entry.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Amp</strong> Choose one enemy who is a target of the spell. If that enemy fails its save or the spell hits it, you whisper in the creature's mind, forcing it to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Step]{Step} in a direction of your choosing; as this is forced movement, you can't force the creature to Step into hazardous terrain, off a ledge, or the like.
