You cast <em>heal</em> on the triggering target. Instead of its normal effects, the <em>heal</em> spell reduces the triggering damage by an amount equal to the Hit Points a 1-action <em>heal</em> spell of that level would have recovered. As usual, if this reduces the damage to 0, it might also remove additional effects of the triggering attack, such as injury poisons.</p>"
