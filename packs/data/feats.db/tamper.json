If you tampered with a weapon, the enemy takes a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls with that weapon. If you tampered with armor, the armor hampers the enemy's movement, making the enemy @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} and inflicting a -10-foot penalty to its Speeds. The effect lasts until the enemy Interacts to remove it, regardless of which one you used.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Your tampering is temporarily effective. As critical success, but the effect ends at the start of your next turn, even if the enemy doesn't Interact to end it.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your tampering backfires dramatically, creating a small explosion from your own tools or gear. You take [[/r {@actor.level}[fire]]]{fire damage equal to your level}.</p>"
