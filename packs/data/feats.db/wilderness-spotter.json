You can use Survival in place of Perception to roll initiative when in the selected terrain in a natural location (not a structure) even if you weren't tracking or otherwise using Survival before the encounter. You can also use Survival instead of Perception to notice traps in natural locations in the chosen terrain; if you find a snare in this way, you can also use Survival instead of Thievery to Disable the Device.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat more than once.
