You can instead use Change Shape to return to your humanoid or hybrid shape at any time during the duration of Critter Shape.</p>\n<p>If your inherent animal is normally larger than Tiny, you transform into a smaller, younger version of the animal, such as a Tiny bear cub. If your inherent animal has a fly Speed, you can turn into that animal (unlike normal for 1st-level <em>pest form</em>), but you still don't gain a fly Speed.</p>"
