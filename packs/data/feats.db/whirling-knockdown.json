You don't need to use brute force to do so, or even necessarily to hit with your gunshot; the effect is all about performing perfectly and eliminating your target's movements and options, leaving them no choice but to fall.</p>\n<p>Make a ranged firearm Strike against a creature within the reach of your melee weapon and then attempt a Performance check against the creature's Reflex DC. If the Strike critically succeeds, the target takes a -2 circumstance penalty to its Reflex DC against this check. The Performance check has the following effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target falls and lands @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Prone]{Prone}.
