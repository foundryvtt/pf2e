This attack doesn't deal damage. On a hit, the target takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speed or a -15-foot status penalty on a critical hit. The penalty lasts for 1 round. This penalty applies only if the target has a land Speed and depends on legs or other targetable appendages to use its land Speed. As with all penalties to Speed, this can't reduce a creature's Speed below 5 feet.</p>"
