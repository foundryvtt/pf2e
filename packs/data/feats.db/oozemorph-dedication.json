You become trained in Occultism and Ooze Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves to avoid being Engulfed by creatures, and to checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Escape]{Escape} after being Engulfed.</p>\n<p>As you develop more abilities based on your amorphous affliction, you become increasingly off-putting to mundane creatures. You take a penalty to Diplomacy checks against animals and humanoids. This penalty is equal to your number of class feats from the oozemorph archetype, to a maximum of -4 for four or more feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the oozemorph archetype.</p>"
