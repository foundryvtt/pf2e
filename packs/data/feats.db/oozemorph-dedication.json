You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves to avoid being Engulfed by creatures, and to checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Escape]{Escape} after being Engulfed.</p>\n<p>As you develop more abilities based on your amorphous affliction, you become increasingly off-putting to mundane creatures. You take a penalty to Diplomacy checks against animals and humanoids. This penalty is equal to your number of class feats from the oozemorph archetype, to a maximum of -4 for four or more feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.tJQ5f8C8m5gpZsF1]{Oozemorph} archetype.</p>"
