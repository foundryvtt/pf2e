If your megafauna companion gains the dying condition, it automatically succeeds at the recovery check to stabilize at 0 Hit Points on its turn. Additionally, your megafauna companion only dies at dying 5 rather than dying 4. Finally, the first time each day your megafauna companion would reach dying 5 and die, as long as you're still alive, your companion's dying value decreases to 0 instead.</p>"
