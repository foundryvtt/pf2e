The symbol doesn't fade until 1 year has passed, but if you Emblazon an Armament, any symbol you previously emblazoned and any symbol already emblazoned on that item instantly disappears. The item becomes a religious symbol of your deity and can be used as a divine focus while emblazoned, and it gains another benefit determined by the type of item. This benefit applies only to followers of the deity the symbol represents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shield</strong> The shield gains a +1 status bonus to its Hardness.
