The symbol doesn't fade until 1 year has passed, but if you Emblazon an Armament, any symbol you previously emblazoned and any symbol already emblazoned on that item instantly disappears. The item becomes a religious symbol of your deity and can be used as a divine focus while emblazoned, and it gains another benefit determined by the type of item. This benefit applies only to followers of the deity the symbol represents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shield</strong> The shield gains a +1 status bonus to its Hardness. (This causes it to reduce more damage with the Shield Block reaction.)</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feat-effects.Effect: Emblazon Armament (Weapon)]{Weapon}</strong> The wielder gains a +1 status bonus to damage rolls.</li>\n</ul>"
