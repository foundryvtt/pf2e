You gain a spell repertoire with two cantrips, either common divine cantrips or other divine cantrips you learn or discover. You're trained in divine spell attack rolls and divine spell DCs. Your key spellcasting ability for oracle archetype spells is Charisma, and they are divine oracle spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the oracle archetype.</p>"
