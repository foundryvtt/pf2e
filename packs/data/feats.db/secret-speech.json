You've learned that society's secret cant or jargon, enabling you to share hidden messages when signing or speaking with others who've also learned it. If an observer succeeds at a Perception check against your Deception DC when you do this, they realize you are passing a message but fail to discern its content, unless they subsequently succeed at a Society check against your Deception DC. On a critical success, they learn not only the message, but also who you're passing the message to.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can take this feat multiple times. You learn the secret speech of a different society each time.</p>"
