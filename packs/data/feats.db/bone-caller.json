You can cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Animal Messenger]{Animal Messenger}</em> and <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Phantom Steed]{Phantom Steed}</em> as primal innate spells once per day each. The animal messenger is always a Tiny dinosaur or lizard, and your innate spell transforms it from bones to flesh, even if there are no dinosaurs or lizards nearby. The phantom steed looks like a dinosaur rather than a horse but functions identically.</p>"
