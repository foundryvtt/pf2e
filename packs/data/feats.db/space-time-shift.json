Your augmented Strides have the teleport trait and don't trigger reactions that can be triggered by move actions or upon leaving or entering a square. You also augment your @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Burrow]{Burrow}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Climb]{Climb}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Fly]{Fly}, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Swim]{Swim} actions in this way if you have the corresponding movement type.</p>"
