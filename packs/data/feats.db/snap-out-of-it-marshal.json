That ally can immediately attempt a Will save with a +1 circumstance bonus against the effect's DC, ending the effect on a success. This can't end the effect for any creatures other than your target ally.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the result of the save, your ally is temporarily immune to Snap Out of It! for 10 minutes.</p>"
