You Interact to draw a deck of cards and flip it in a fluttering explosion, causing you to become briefly @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} to all other creatures using vision as their precise sense, and then you Sneak. You have enough cover to Sneak until the end of your turn. This leaves all of the cards from the deck scattered about the room; collecting them into a deck again takes several minutes.</p>"
