You become an expert in Crafting, and you choose one vehicle you own-or your party owns collectively-to be your signature vehicle: the vehicle you spend time customizing to grant it various advantages. You can spend 1 week of downtime with a new vehicle to designate it as your signature vehicle instead. Due to your amazing customizations and adjustments, pilots gain a +1 circumstance bonus to any piloting checks they make to control your signature vehicle. If you are a master in Crafting, this bonus increases to +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the mechanic archetype.</p>"
