This creature either gains a +2 status bonus to Stealth or takes a -2 status penalty to Perception (your choice). This lasts for 1 round. This choice and the effect occur after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects. If the chosen creature is your enemy, it's affected only if your spell attack roll succeeded or if it failed its saving throw.</p>\n<p>The effects of <em>Shadow Spell</em> end if you use <em>Shadow Spell</em> again.</p>"
