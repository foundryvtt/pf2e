The temporary item must be common, non-magical, 1st level or lower, and must be a weapon, armor, or a nonconsumable piece of adventuring gear. Instead of a single item, you can create 10 pieces of a single type of ammunition. This is a shoddy item, but you don't take the normal penalty when using shoddy items you made using this feat.</p>\n<p>Your temporary item lasts for [[/r 1d4 #hours]]{1d4 hours} before falling apart into its raw components; the GM rolls the number of hours secretly. You can create only the physical item, not any information or magic, so for example, while you could create a blank journal or one of random pages, you couldn't use it as a scholarly journal or a religious text.</p>\n<p>You can incorporate any materials or items that you have on hand, even if they're not the type of materials that would ordinarily be used to Craft a given item, though you must have enough volume of material to make the item you want.</p>\n<p>Unless all the materials you used were an appropriate type to make the item, you take a -5 penalty to the Crafting check (or a -10 penalty if the materials you used were particularly unsuitable, as determined by the GM).</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the scrounger archetype.</p>"
