As with your hearing and other imprecise senses, you still need to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} to locate an undetected creature.</p>\n<p>As spiritsense detects spiritual essence, not physical bodies, it can detect spirits projected by spells such as <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Project Image]{Project Image}</em> or possessing otherwise soulless objects. It can't detect soulless bodies, constructs, or objects, and like most senses, it doesn't penetrate through solid objects.</p>"
