Add the unstable trait to Deep Freeze. The ability affects all creatures within a @Template[type:cone|distance:60] instead of a single target, and it deals cold damage equal to double your level instead of equal to your level.</p>\n<p>If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, you can choose a @Template[type:cone|distance:60] or a @Template[type:cone|distance:90] when you use an unstable Deep Freeze.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you.</p>"
