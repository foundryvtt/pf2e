The ability affects all creatures within a <span data-pf2-effect-area=\"cone\" data-pf2-distance=\"60\" data-pf2-traits=\"cold,inventor,manipulate\">60-foot cone</span> instead of a single target, and it deals cold damage equal to double your level instead of equal to your level.</p>\n<p>If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, you can choose a <span data-pf2-effect-area=\"cone\" data-pf2-distance=\"60\" data-pf2-traits=\"cold,inventor,manipulate\">60-foot cone</span> or <span data-pf2-effect-area=\"cone\" data-pf2-distance=\"90\" data-pf2-traits=\"cold,inventor,manipulate\">90-foot cone</span> when you use an unstable Deep Freeze.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you.</p>"
