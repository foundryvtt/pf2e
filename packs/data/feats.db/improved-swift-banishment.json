You must sacrifice a prepared spell of 5th level or higher, and the <em>banishment</em> effect you create is heightened to the level of that spell. Your weapon serves as the special material component of <em>banishment</em>, causing the target to take the -2 penalty to its save against any banishment you cast using Swift Banishment.</p>"
