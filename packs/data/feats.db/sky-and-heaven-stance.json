The only Strikes you can make are skyward slash unarmed attacks. These unarmed attacks deal 1d10 slashing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the nonlethal, unarmed, and versatile P traits.<br /><br />While in Sky and Heaven Stance, you gain resistance 2 to electricity and resistance 2 to sonic damage. These resistances increase to 5 at 12th level and to 8 at 18th level.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.feat-effects.Stance: Sky and Heaven Stance]{Stance: Sky and Heaven Stance}</p>"
