You create a minor explosion from your innovation, altering the combustion to cauterize wounds using vaporized medicinal herbs. You or a living creature adjacent to you regains 1d10 Hit Points. In addition, the creature you heal can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of persistent bleed damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, increase the healing by 1d10.
