When calculating your travel speed for the day while piloting a vehicle, you can attempt a Driving Lore check to increase your vehicle's travel speed. The DC is determined by the GM but is typically based on the vehicle's piloting DC or a difficulty based on the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, increase your vehicle's travel speed by half. This has no effect on your vehicle's movement in encounters.</p>"
