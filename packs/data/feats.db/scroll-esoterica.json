Each day during your daily preparations, you can create a single temporary scroll containing a 1st-level spell of any tradition. The spell must be common, or you must otherwise have access to it. This scroll is an unstable, temporary item and loses its magic the next time you make your daily preparations if you haven't used it by then. It can't be used to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Learn a Spell]{Learn the Spell}.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, add a second temporary scroll containing a 2nd-level spell.</p>"
