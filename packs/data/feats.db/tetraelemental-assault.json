When you use Elemental Assault, instead of choosing a single element, you can choose an element from the list when using the action, and then choose a different element at the beginning of each of your next 3 turns without spending an action; once you have chosen an element, you can't choose it again during this Elemental Assault, meaning you must select all four elements over the course of 4 turns. Each time you choose an element, until the beginning of your next turn, your Strikes deal an additional [[/r 1d6]] damage of the indicated type and have the trait corresponding to that element.</p>"
