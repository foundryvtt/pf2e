When you stop being @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} due to your own actions (not due to someone successfully finding you), you gain @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Concealed]{Concealement} until the start of your next turn as people's eyes find it oddly hard to focus on you.
