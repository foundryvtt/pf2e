Choose two additional offensive boosts. You can use an Interact action to change the offensive boost currently affecting your weapon, choosing between the one you chose for the class feature and the two you chose for this modification. If your weapon has the modular trait, you can swap the offensive boost as part of the Interact action you take to use that trait.</p>"
