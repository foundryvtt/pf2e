This gem has been specially calibrated to hold one of the following spells: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Repulsion]{Repulsion}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Scrying]{Scrying}</em>, or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.True Seeing]{True Seeing}</em>. You must decide which spell your gem contains when you take this feat; changing the spell requires retraining the feat. Once per day, you can drain the gem's magical energy to Cast the Spell without spending a spell slot.</p>\n<p>At 18th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 7th level. At 20th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 8th level; regardless of which spell you chose, you can instead drain the gem's magical energy to cast an 8th-level spell turning without spending a spell slot.</p>"
