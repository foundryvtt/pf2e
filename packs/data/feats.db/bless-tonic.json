When you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Craft]{Craft} an alchemical item that restores Hit Points (rather than create it with advanced alchemy, Quick Alchemy, or another means), it becomes a blessed alchemical item and gains the positive trait. For example, an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Elixir of Life (Minor)]{Elixir of Life} would become a blessed elixir of life. When a creature regains Hit Points using a blessed alchemical item, the overflowing energy grants them negative resistance 5 for 1 round, or negative resistance 10 if you are legendary in Crafting.</p>"
