You deal [[/r {7d6[acid],7d6[negative]}]]{7d6 acid and 7d6 negative damage} to all creatures within a @Template[type:cone|distance:30] (@Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)|basic:true] save with a DC equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). A creature that gets a critical failure on this Reflex save is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Paralyzed]{Paralyzed} for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at this save becomes temporarily immune to Breath of Hungry Death for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>When a creature is killed using Breath of Hungry Death, its body is reduced to a smoldering pile of ash wafting with necrotic fumes.
