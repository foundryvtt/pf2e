When you activate a magic item to generate a spell effect, attempt a Deception check. If you succeed against an onlooker's Perception DC, to that onlooker, you appear to cast that spell instead. Onlookers who successfully recognize the spell realize you used a magic item, though those who later successfully identify the magic still can't determine that the source of the effect was a magic item.</p>"
