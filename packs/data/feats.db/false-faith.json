After spending 1 hour in prayer to Droskar, you can cast spells using the religious symbol of a different deity as your divine focus, and you can address verbal prayers to that deity. Droskar intercepts your prayers and answers them without the named god knowing.</p>\n<p>This ability applies to the religious symbol of only one god at a time-making a different religious symbol work in this fashion requires another hour of prayer and causes the old one to cease functioning. You can always use a religious symbol of Droskar without affecting this ability.</p>"
