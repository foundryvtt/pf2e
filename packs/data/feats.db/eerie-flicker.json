If the flat check fails, the Strike misses you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Awakening</strong> When your body flickers, you momentarily assume a terrifying form. If a creature fails the flat check against concealment from your Eerie Flicker, it becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Frightened]{Frightened 1}, and it doesn't reduce the frightened condition from this effect at the end of the same turn it gained the condition.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Awakening</strong> You can choose to compress your flickering movement into a single moment, increasing your chance to avoid the triggering attack in exchange for a shorter-lived effect. If you choose to do so, the flat check for concealment against the triggering attack increases to DC 9, but the concealment affects only the triggering Strike.</p>"
