You get one clan pistol of your clan for free, as it was given to you at birth. This replaces your clan dagger. Selling this pistol is a terrible taboo and earns you the disdain of other dwarves. You are trained with the clan pistol. In addition, when your clan pistol is visible, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Gather Information]{Gather Information} or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Make an Impression]{Make an Impression} when interacting with citizens of Alkenstar, Dongun Hold, or their allies.</p>"
