The GM rolls a secret Perception check using the poison's level to determine the DC; on a success, you learn that the food or drink was poisoned, but not the specific poison used.</p>\n<p>If you lick or taste something while Investigating or attempting to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Recall Knowledge (Lore)]{Recall Knowledge} to identify something, if the taste would provide relevant additional information (at the GM's discretion), you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check.</p>"
