You fire them all at once in either a @Template[type:cone|distance:30]{30-foot cone} or a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10]{10-foot emanation}. Foes in the area take [[/r {6d6}[piercing]]]{6d6 piercing damage}. This increases to [[/r {7d6}[piercing]]]{7d6} at 12th level, [[/r {8d6}[piercing]]]{8d6} at 15th level, and [[/r {9d6}[piercing]]]{9d6} at 18th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhancement</strong> The projectiles regenerate quicker, they are much more powerful, and you can refine the metallic content to harm certain creatures. You can use Rain of Bolts once per hour instead of once per day. The damage increases to [[/r {12d6}[piercing]]]{12d6} and each time you use the action, you can choose adamantine, cold iron, or silver. The damage from Rain of Bolts is treated as the metal you chose. At 20th level, the damage increases to [[/r {13d6}[piercing]]]{13d6}.</p>"
