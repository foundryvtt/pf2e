You gain a 1st-level psi cantrip for a conscious mind other than your own; this can be either the unique surface cantrip or one of the common cantrips and the accompanying amp. If you choose a common cantrip, you also gain the special benefit granted by that conscious mind when casting the cantrip without an amp.
