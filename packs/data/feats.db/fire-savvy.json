Your flat check to remove persistent fire damage is @Check[type:flat|dc:10] instead of DC 15, which is reduced to @Check[type:flat|dc:5] with appropriate assistance. In addition, if you roll a success on a saving throw against suffocation or choking due to smoke or ash, you get a critical success instead.</p>"
