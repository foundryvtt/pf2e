During this Stride, instead of moving through each space normally, you hop over every other square between your starting space and your ending space. These hops aren’t high enough to jump over a creature or other significant obstacle in your way, but they avoid difficult terrain, hazardous terrain, pressure plates, or hazards on the ground or up to a foot above it in the spaces you hopped over.</p>"
