You quickly switch your grip during the Strike in order to make the attack with two hands.</p>\n<p>If the weapon doesn't normally have the two-hand trait, increase its weapon damage die by one step for this attack. (Rules on increasing die size appear on page 279.) If the weapon has the two-hand trait, you gain the benefit of that trait and a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the weapon's number of damage dice.</p>\n<p>When the Strike is complete, you resume gripping the weapon with only one hand. This action doesn't end any stance or fighter feat effect that requires you to have one hand free.</p>"
