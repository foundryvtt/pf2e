When you do, you summon a number of instruments equal to your spellcasting ability modifier that hover around you and play of their own accord. Once per turn when you Sustain the Spell, choose an opponent within 30 feet who can hear your performance. The target must attempt a Will save against the spell's DC; on a failure, it becomes distracted by your performance and becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} for 1 round. The target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>"
