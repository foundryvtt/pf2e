While the stone is embedded this way, you gain the benefits of the aeon stone as if it were orbiting above your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. <em>Aeon stones</em> in your flesh must be invested to function, as usual.</p>\n<p>You can also use this activity to safely remove an embedded <em>aeon stone</em> in 1 day. Someone without this feat can attempt to surgically remove it safely by spending 1 day and succeeding at a DC 30 Medicine check, or hastily by simply ripping it from a corpse.</p>"
