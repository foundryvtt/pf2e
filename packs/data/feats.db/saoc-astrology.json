You recall the stars' predictions about your current situation. If your next action requires you to attempt one or more skill checks, roll [[/r 1d8]]. On a result of 6, 7, or 8, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the first such skill check you attempt. On a 3, 4, or 5, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus. On a 2, you gain nothing.
