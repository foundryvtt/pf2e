If the target of the failed check is the subject of a lead you’re pursuing, double your bonus from @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.xTK2zsWFyxSJvYbX]{Pursue a Lead} on the rerolled check. That creature is temporarily immune to Just One More Thing for 1 day.</p>\n<p>You can also use this action if you failed, but didn’t critically fail, at a check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.ewwCglB7XOPLUz72]{Lie}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.plBGdZhqq5JBl1D8]{Gather Information}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q]{Make an Impression}, or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.tHCqgwjtQtzNqVvd]{Coerce}. In this case, rather than spending 1 action, adding Just One More Thing takes you half the amount of time you initially spent on the check, to a minimum of 1 more round.</p>",
