You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Sense Motive]{Sense Motive} when trying to determine if a creature is possessed or under the influence of an effect that would make them controlled, a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks made to see through disguises worn by undead, and a +2 circumstance bonus when using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} action to find @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} or undetected haunts or undead within 30 feet of you.</p>\n<p>If you aren't using the Seek action or searching, the GM automatically rolls a secret check for you to notice haunts or undead within 30 feet anyway. This check doesn't gain the usual +2 circumstance bonus, and instead takes a -2 circumstance penalty.</p>"
