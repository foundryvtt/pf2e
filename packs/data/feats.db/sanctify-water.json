For 1 round, if you or an ally throw this container at a foe, it has the damaging effects of @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Holy Water]{Holy Water} (if you follow a good deity) or @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Unholy Water]{Unholy Water} (if you follow an evil deity). The water's transient power doesn't make it gain any value, allow it to be used to supply the cost for a spell or ritual, and so on.
