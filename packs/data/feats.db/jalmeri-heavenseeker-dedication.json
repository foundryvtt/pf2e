You become trained in either Acrobatics or Occultism. You gain either the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Ki Rush]{Ki Rush} or @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Ki Strike]{Ki Strike} monk feat, which grants you a ki spell and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Refocus]{Refocus} activity as a monk does. If you already have both these feats, you can instead choose a single 1st-level monk feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Jalmeri Heavenseeker archetype.</p>"
