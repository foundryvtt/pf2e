This doesn't grant any of the normal benefits of heightening a spell, but the spell lasts up to 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>For example, if you prepared <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Animal Form]{Animal Form}</em> in a 4th-level slot with Form Retention, you would cast a 2nd-level <em>animal form</em> that lasts for up to 10 minutes. If the spell can be Dismissed, that doesn't change.</p>"
