You incorporate enough worship of Walkena in your daily life to avoid suspicion.

Against careful inspection, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception checks specifically to pass yourself off as a version of yourself faithful to Walkena.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Bright Lion archetype.</p>"
