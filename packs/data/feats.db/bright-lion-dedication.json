You incorporate enough worship of Walkena in your daily life to avoid suspicion. You typically don't need to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Lie]{Lie} or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Impersonate]{Impersonate} to pass yourself off as a worshipper of Walkena. Against careful inspection, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception checks specifically to pass yourself off as a version of yourself faithful to Walkena.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Bright Lion archetype.</p>"
