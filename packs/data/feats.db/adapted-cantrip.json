If you prepare spells without a spellbook (if you're a cleric or druid, for example), one of your cantrips must always be the chosen spell, and you prepare the rest normally. You can cast this cantrip as a spell of your class's tradition. If you swap or retrain this cantrip later, you can choose its replacement from the same alternate tradition or a different one</p>"
