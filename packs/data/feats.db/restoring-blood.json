You can use your @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Envenom]{Envenom} action to produce a blood restorative instead of vishkanyan venom. You can make a blood restorative at most once per 10 minutes, even if your Envenom action can be used more frequently. You or an adjacent creature can Interact to consume the restorative to regain [[/r {3d6}[Healing]]]{3d6 Hit Points}. This is a positive healing effect. A restorative spoils at the start of your next turn. When you reach 15th level, the restorative restores [[/r {5d6}[Healing]]]{5d6 Hit Points instead}.</p>"
