You can fit an additional 50% of the listed Bulk capacity into mundane storage containers or vehicles.</p>\n<p>For example, you can fit 6 Bulk in a backpack, or 12 Bulk in a chest. This doesn't alter the items' Bulk, nor does it change how much you can store in a magical or extradimensional storage space, such as a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Bag of Holding (Type I)]{Bag of Holding}.</p>"
