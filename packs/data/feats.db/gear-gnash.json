Creatures attempting to Disable your snares that use gears must succeed at an additional Thievery check in order to disable the snare. On a failed check, while the snare doesn't fully trigger, the grinding mechanisms deal bludgeoning damage to the creature equal to half your level. The snare still triggers on a critical failure, as normal.</p>"
