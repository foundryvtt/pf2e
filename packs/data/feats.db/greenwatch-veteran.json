Attempt a Recall Knowledge check against the creature you were @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Track]{Tracking}. On a success, you always know the creature's greatest weakness and highest resistance or immunity, in addition to any other information the check would typically provide. You immediately use a quick series of hand gestures to signal this information to any allies who can see you.</p>"
