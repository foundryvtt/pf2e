You regain the use of a spell that was disrupted since the beginning of your last turn, but you must immediately Cast the Spell again with your next action or else you lose the spell; as normal for metamagic, this must be on the same turn that you use Recover Spell. You can change the area, targets, and other variables, including the number of actions used to Cast the Spell if the spell allows, such as when casting <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Heal]{Heal}</em> or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Magic Missile]{Magic Missile}</em>.</p>"
