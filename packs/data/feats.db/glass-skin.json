Patches of your skin to flicker into glass without warning. By focusing the effect, you can concentrate the glass into a powerful protective layer of magical obsidian. Once per day, you can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Stoneskin]{Stoneskin}</em> on yourself as an innate primal spell, though the spell covers you in a layer of glass instead of stone. During this innate stoneskin, you gain the Shatter Glass reaction. At 18th level, the stoneskin is heightened to 6th level instead of 4th.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Shatter Glass</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">r</span></p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An adjacent creature Strikes you with a melee weapon or unarmed attack and deals damage</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> Your innate stoneskin from Glass Skin is active</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You shatter some of the glass on your skin to damage your attacker.
