Patches of your skin to flicker into glass without warning. By focusing the effect, you can concentrate the glass into a powerful protective layer of magical obsidian. Once per day, you can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Stoneskin]{Stoneskin}</em> on yourself as an innate primal spell, though the spell covers you in a layer of glass instead of stone. During this innate stoneskin, you gain the Shatter Glass reaction.
