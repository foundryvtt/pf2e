You can create only level-0 common, non-consumable weapons, or adventuring gear with no intricate parts, written text, or other complicated components. The item lasts until used for a single activity, until you Sculpt Shadows again, or for 1 minute, whichever comes first. Once the duration expires, the object dissipates, and you regain the lost Hit Point unless the item was Broken or Destroyed. As the object holds a tiny sliver of your shadow, you can't recover the lost Hit Point until after the object dissipates.</p>"
