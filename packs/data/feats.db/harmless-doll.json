You gain the trained proficiency rank in Deception (or another skill if you're already trained in Deception), and you can Impersonate an inanimate toy or a mindless poppet. You can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Hide]{Hide} without any cover or concealment from creatures that don't realize you're alive, so long as you're in a location where a toy of your shape wouldn't be out of place, like a carnival booth, city street, or toy shop (at the GM's discretion). If you succeed, onlookers still see you, but they mistake you for an inanimate toy. After being fooled once, they realize you're alive, and you can't Hide from them in that way again.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Note: If you are already trained in the skill provided by this feat, you need to manually select an alternative skill.</em></p>"
