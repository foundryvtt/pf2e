You fire a blast or beam from one hand. Make an attack roll against a creature within 30 feet. If you succeed, the beam deals [[/r (floor(@actor.level/2)d6)]]]{1d6 damage for every 2 levels} you have to the target, or double damage on a critical success.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Awakening</strong> Your beams blast through targets. Instead of making an attack roll to damage a single creature within 30 feet, you can use Blasting Beams as a 2-action activity to damage all creatures in a @Template[type:line|distance:60], with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)|basic:true] save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Awakening</strong> You can choose to launch smaller, quicker beams from your eyes instead. These deal d4s instead of d6s, but the attack has the agile trait, and you don't need a hand free to make it, though your eyes must be uncovered.</p>"
