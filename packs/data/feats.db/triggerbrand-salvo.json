Make a melee Strike with your combination weapon. If the Strike is successful, you can immediately make a ranged Strike against the same target with that combination weapon, and you get a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll. This counts as two attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after making both attacks.</p>"
