            "value": "<p>It is a tradition among artillerists to name the siege weapon most important to them and closest to their heart-much as a sailor on a ship, the weapon is their livelihood. You've gone a step further, and you always make sure that your named artillery has the best possible maintenance and upkeep. You can spend a full day adjusting and working on a single siege weapon to designate it as your named artillery. The siege weapon you designated as your named artillery gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, Fortitude saves, and Reflex saves as well as additional Hit Points equal to twice your level.</p>\n<p>During your daily preparations, you must spend at least one hour on maintenance to service your named artillery. If you fail to do so, or if you spend a full day designating a new piece of named artillery, the previous named artillery loses any benefits from this feat. Only one artillerist can designate a particular siege weapon as their named artillery, even if several artillerists are serving on the same siege weapon's crew (though it's typically more efficient for a group with several artillerists to divide them up, assigning one to each siege weapon).</p>"
