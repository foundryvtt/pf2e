You look down and find that your implement has mysteriously appeared in your free hand, as long as the implement was within 1 mile and on the same plane of existence. If your implement is attended by another creature, that creature can prevent the implement from teleporting away if it succeeds at a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.system.proficiencies.classDCs.thaumaturge.value)] save against your class DC. If the creature succeeds, you can't attempt to Call that Implement again; you must track the creature down to get the implement back.</p>"
