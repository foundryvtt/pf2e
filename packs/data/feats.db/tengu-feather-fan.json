You gain a <em>tengu feather fan</em>: a magic item of light Bulk with a level equal to your level and the evocation and primal traits. You (and only you) can use the <em>tengu feather fan</em> to cast tengu magic. If your fan is lost or destroyed, you can create a replacement during your daily preparations; if you do so, your previous fan falls apart into mundane feathers. Further feats might grant you additional activations of your <em>tengu feather fan</em>, but you can never have more than three activations per day, no matter how many such feats you have. The DC for spells you cast with your <em>tengu feather fan</em> is your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.You can cast the 1st-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Gust of Wind]{Gust of Wind}</em> spell by activating your <em>tengu feather fan</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You cast one of the spells contained in your t<em>engu feather fan</em>.
