You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks and saving throws against dragons. In addition, whenever you meet a creature with the dragon trait in a social situation, you can attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression on that creature immediately, rather than after conversing for 1 minute; you take a -5 penalty to this check. If you fail, you can choose to engage in 1 minute of conversation and then attempt a new check rather than accept the failure or critical failure result.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> If you have the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Glad-Hand]{Glad-Hand} skill feat, you don't take the penalty to your immediate Diplomacy check if the target has the dragon trait.</p>"
