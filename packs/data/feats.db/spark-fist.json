The resulting pops of flame harm both you and your enemy. Until the end of your next turn, your fist loses the nonlethal trait and deals an additional [[/r {1}[fire] damage]]{1 fire} on a successful Strike. Each time you succeed on a fist Strike, you take [[/r {1}[fire] damage]]{1 fire}. If your fist would deal more than one weapon damage die, the fire damage dealt on a successful Strike, to both you and your opponent, is equal to the number of weapon damage dice.</p>"
