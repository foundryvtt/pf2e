            "value": "<p>You've undertaken the ultimate challenge of the Mammoth Lords and tamed a megafauna. You gain a megafauna you tamed as a young animal companion. Your megafauna animal companion must be a megafauna appropriate to the Realm of the Mammoth Lords;. While an animal companion usually starts as Small, you can begin with a Medium version of that animal (changing no statistics other than its size).</p>\n<p>Contrary to the usual rules for animal companions, this feat can give you a second animal companion. If you have more than one animal companion, you can adventure with only one of them at a time. You can switch between them like a beastmaster does. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Call Companion]{Call Companion} action, as the beastmaster archetype, and you follow all the other rules found in the Call Companion sidebar; see @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Beastmaster Dedication]{Beastmaster Dedication} for details on this action and the rules for multiple companions.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from this archetype.</p>"
