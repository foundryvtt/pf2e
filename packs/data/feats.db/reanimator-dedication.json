If you're a spontaneous spellcaster with <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Animate Dead]{Animate Dead}</em> in your repertoire, it becomes a signature spell in addition to your usual signature spells. If you're a prepared spellcaster with animate dead in your spells known, spellbook, or the like, you can spend 10 minutes contemplating undeath to replace one of the spells you've prepared in your spell slots with an animate dead spell of the same level. In addition, if you're able to target the mostly intact remains of an appropriate type of dead creature when casting animate dead, the undead you animate gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, AC, saving throws, and skill checks for the duration of animate dead.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Effect: Reanimator Dedication]{Effect: Reanimator Dedication}</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.ePfibeHcnRcjO6lC]{Reanimator} archetype.</p>"
