You gain the duskwalker trait in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You also gain @Compendium[pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Low-Light Vision]{Low-Light Vision}, or you gain @Compendium[pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Darkvision]{Darkvision} if your ancestry already has low-light vision. Neither your body nor your spirit can ever become undead. You can choose from duskwalker feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.</p>"
