You can attempt to walk along the surface of flowing water as well, still moving at half Speed, but doing so requires a successful Acrobatics check to Balance using the DC of a Swim check to move through the water; on a failure, you fall into the water. This Acrobatics check doesn’t use an action.</p>"
