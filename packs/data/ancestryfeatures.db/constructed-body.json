During this period of rest, you must enter a recuperating standby state for 2 hours, which is similar to sleeping except you are aware of your surroundings and don't take penalties for being @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Unconscious]{Unconscious}. Much like with sleeping, if you go too long without entering your standby state, you become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Fatigued]{Fatigued} and can't recover until you enter standby for 2 hours.</p>"
