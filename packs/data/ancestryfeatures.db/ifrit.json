You gain resistance to fire equal to half your level (minimum 1), and you treat environmental heat effects as if they were one step less severe (incredible heat becomes extreme, extreme heat becomes severe, and so on). You can choose from ifrit feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>GENIEKIN FEATS</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels).
