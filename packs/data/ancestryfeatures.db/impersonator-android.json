You become trained in Deception (or another skill if you’re already trained in Deception). You don’t require a disguise kit when attempting Deception checks to Impersonate a human. In addition, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Impersonate checks to pretend that you’re a human version of yourself, rather than an android. This bonus doesn’t apply to other checks to Impersonate humans.</p>"
