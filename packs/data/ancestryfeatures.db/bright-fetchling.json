You emit dim light within 5 feet of you. You can activate or suppress this ability as an action, which has the concentrate trait. Additionally, you can force fragments of your shadow to glow and cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Dancing Lights]{Dancing Lights} and @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Light]{Light} as occult innate cantrips. Cantrips are heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.</p>"
