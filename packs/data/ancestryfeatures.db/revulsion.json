A creature must Interact to brandish garlic or a religious symbol for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If you involuntarily come within 10 feet of an object of your revulsion, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Fleeing]{Fleeing} condition, running from the subject of your revulsion until you end an action beyond 10 feet of it. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of your revulsion, you can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:25] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, you overcome your revulsions for [[/r 1d6 #Overcome Revulsion Duration]]{1d6 rounds}, or 1 hour on a critical success.</p>"
