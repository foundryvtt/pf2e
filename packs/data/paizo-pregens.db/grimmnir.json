                "public": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Grimmnir is a dragon mage, a scion of draconic magic who almost all kobolds respect and honor. At least, that&rsquo;s what Grimmnir claims. Other Hookclaws have noticed that her magic doesn&rsquo;t seem much like that of other kobold dragon mages. To put it simply, Grimmnir is... creepy. Where dragons pulse with arcane power and unfettered charisma, Grimmnir&rsquo;s sorcery has always felt foreboding and hateful, laced with a shivering chill of damnation that crawls up the spine and chews on the back of the mind. Grimmnir always gets very scary and glows her eyes whenever anyone brings it up, though, so the Hookclaws keep their mouths shut and don&rsquo;t argue with her. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Grimmnir pays them little mind. She knows she is a true child of dragons. Ever since she was a hatchling, Grimmnir has dreamed of them: world-ending wyrms that lurk in the deepest recesses of reality, beneath the waves and beyond the universe, who gnaw on the roots of existence and will rise up from the depths at the end of days. Yet though that destructive power is her legacy, Grimmnir has decided not to follow in those great wyrms&rsquo; footsteps&mdash;not completely. The kobold has performed a careful consideration of all the pros and cons, and decided that destroying the world would be both personally inconvenient and more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">All the same, Grimmnir feels compelled to embrace her destiny to become one of the devourers of worlds, even if she never actually does any world-devouring. In her mind, this means growing much, much taller, and building her strength through any means possible. Despite cramming herself full of food and other brilliant ideas, the kobold has had no luck increasing her height, so she has been forced to turn all her efforts to self-improvement. To this end, Grimmnir has joined the kobold militia, intending to turn her acid-tipped claws and fearsome bite against whatever obstacles she encounters. The Hookclaws appreciate her prowess at protecting the tribe&mdash;and appreciate it even more when Grimmnir is out on patrol and thus nowhere to be seen!</span></p>",

They are ingenious crafters and devoted allies within their warrens, but those who trespass into their territory find them to be inspired skirmishers, especially when they have the backing of a draconic sorcerer or true dragon overlord. However, these reptilian opportunists prove happy to cooperate with other humanoids when it's to their benefit, combining caution and cunning to make their fortunes in the wider world.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Kobolds are resourceful survivors whose snare-guarded warrens and opportunistic scavenging have cast them as villains to most other humanoids, with their draconic reverence lending them a reputation as mere minions and nuisances. Yet some kobolds have emerged from their secluded warrens seeking the relative safety of surface settlements, the lucrative prospects of the adventuring life, or validating awe from followers of their own.</p>\n<p>If you want a character with oversized confidence, deadly cunning, and the ancient power of dragons flowing through their veins, you should play a kobold.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Take pride in your draconic connections, whether you believe dragons are your ancestors or simply patrons.</li>\n<li>Analyze your surroundings, always looking for ambushes, advantageous terrain, and escape routes.</li>\n<li>Naturally observe, adopt, and respect group dynamics, whether as leader, subordinate, or equal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume that you are cowardly and won't stick around in the face of danger.</li>\n<li>Appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness, especially when it comes to building defenses.</li>\n<li>Consider your claims of draconic power to be overblown, delusional, or endearing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kobolds are short (about 3 feet tall) reptilian humanoids with slender bodies and long tails. They often boast distant draconic ancestry, and every kobold displays one or more draconic features, such as stout horns, razor-sharp teeth, or—more rarely—vestigial wings or draconic breath. They mature quickly, reaching adulthood by about 12 years and living to about 60.</p>\n<p>The color of a kobold's scales can vary widely. Most often, they mimic the hues of chromatic or metallic dragons, with a mix of slightly darker or lighter scales that create a mottled appearance. The scales of newly hatched kobolds often reflect the community's draconic exemplar, whether that's the dragon they currently serve or the dragon type from which they're descended.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Kobolds have an ingrained cautiousness that keeps them alive. They're secretive or subservient around powerful creatures to avoid becoming victims. This meekness fades once kobolds secure either a formidable patron (like a dragon) or a potent source of supernatural power (like an artifact or sorcerous leader). They often achieve an unshakable fervor and loyalty to their new cause or leader. However, kobolds are infamous for sensing a proverbial sinking ship, and once their source of power fails or seems doomed, their morale breaks swiftly.</p>\n<p>Whether led by a dragon or not, kobolds almost always identify themselves with a type of dragon that serves as their spiritual exemplar. Their societies regularly adopt laws and cultural norms inspired by the exemplar's personality.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>All but the most iconoclastic kobolds have a natural respect for hierarchies and rules, and so kobolds are rarely chaotic. Kobold adventurers tend to be lawful neutral or neutral, relying on their ancestral social strategies for survival.</p>\n<p>Organized religion feels natural for most kobolds, especially when a deity assumes a commanding or tyrannical disposition. Many gravitate toward Abadar's order or Shelyn's artistic flair. More sinister communities uphold Asmodeus and other archdevils as common patrons. The dragon deities Apsu and Dahak are also common subjects of worship. Kobolds also often find themselves drawn to cults, particularly those with dragons or devils as figureheads.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Kobolds often adventure in pursuit of the power, lore, and treasure that they feel befit their disproportionately large egos. When adventurers, militias, or careless tyrants shatter a kobold community, the survivors often latch onto new families, seeking emotional solace—and sometimes revenge. Typical kobold backgrounds include artisan, artist, criminal, hunter, miner, scout, and tinker from the Core Rulebook, plus bandit, cultist, scavenger, and servant from this book. Kobolds excel as bards, rangers, rogues, and sorcerers, though they also often channel their ingenuity as alchemists or wizards.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>A young kobold's given name is rarely more than a syllable or two. However, as they age, achieve status, and accomplish great deeds, kobolds add more syllables to their names, imitating a common draconic practice. Kobolds rarely have surnames except in an effort to better fit into a community, in which case they typically adopt the surname of an inspiring figure in that group.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Azrnak, Draahzin, Enga, Fazgyn, Fazij, Jekkajak, Kib, Kirrok, Mirkol, Tarka, Urkak, Varshez, Vroklan, Zekstikah, Zgaz</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>PFS Note</strong>: Due to years of successful Pathfinder Society activities, all characters have access to the kobold ancestry.</p>"

Bloodline spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don't need to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules can be found here.</p>\n<h3>Reading A Bloodline Entry</h3>\n<p>A bloodline entry contains the following information:</p>\n<p><strong>Spell List</strong> You use this magical tradition and spell list.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Skills</strong> You become trained in the listed skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Granted Spells</strong> You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, as described in the Spell Repertoire class feature. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a 1st-level spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that level.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Spells</strong> You automatically gain the initial bloodline spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the Advanced Bloodline and Greater Bloodline feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Blood Magic</strong> Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using Focus Points or a granted spell from your bloodline using a spell slot, you gain a blood magic effect. If the blood magic offers a choice, make it before resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects and, against a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references to spell level refer to the level of the spell you cast.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sorcerer Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells on page 302). Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch.<br /><br />Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.<br /><br />As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3-17: Sorcerer Spells per Day on page 193.<br /><br />Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a sorcerer. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table style=\"height: 356px; width: 540px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"color: white;

At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.<br /><br />You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3-17), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new level of spells, your first new spell is always your bloodline spell, but you can choose the other spells you gain. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new bloodline spell and two other 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might choose a higher-level version of a spell you already have so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.<br /><br />Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Swapping Spells in your Repertoire</h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats appear in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sorcerer Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a sorcerer class feat. These begin on page 198.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Signature Spells<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.<br /><br />At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry in Chapter 2.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Simple Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Training and magic improved your weapon technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Defensive Robes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>The flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to inflict grave wounds with your practiced weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled you mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Bloodline Paragon<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-level spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, and they can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Bloodline Perfection]{Bloodline Perfection} sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to legendary.</p>"

It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don't need to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules can be found here.</p>\n<h3>Reading A Bloodline Entry</h3>\n<p>A bloodline entry contains the following information:</p>\n<p><strong>Spell List</strong> You use this magical tradition and spell list.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Skills</strong> You become trained in the listed skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Granted Spells</strong> You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, as described in the Spell Repertoire class feature. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a 1st-level spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that level.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Spells</strong> You automatically gain the initial bloodline spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the Advanced Bloodline and Greater Bloodline feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Blood Magic</strong> Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using Focus Points or a granted spell from your bloodline using a spell slot, you gain a blood magic effect. If the blood magic offers a choice, make it before resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects and, against a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references to spell level refer to the level of the spell you cast.</p>"

You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells on page 302). Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch.<br /><br />Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.<br /><br />As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3-17: Sorcerer Spells per Day on page 193.<br /><br />Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a sorcerer. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;
