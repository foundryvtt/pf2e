                "backstory": "<p>Muruwa grew up in the jungles just outside Nantambu, her village high aloft in the treetops towering just outside the city. She spent her younger days sneaking away from her village to explore Nantambu, and the need to avoid watchful eyes, be they grippli or Nantambiyan, quickly taught Muruwa the necessity of stealth. While she initially used her sojourns into the city to make off with sweets and other snacks, Muruwa found herself returning to learn more about the city's people. It was during one of these visits that Muruwa learned of the Magaambya and began to develop a fascination with magic.</p>\n<p>As her curiosity grew, Muruwa decided to enroll in the Magaambya, and so she set out for Nantambu one last time. After arriving, the intrepid grippli took to living on the streets and earning coin through various odd jobs. Once she saved enough money to buy her first set of supplies, she enrolled in the academy. Muruwa now dedicates most of her time to learning all that she can about magic and the world beyond the jungle she calls home.</p>\n<p>Muruwa has a difficult time relating with others and takes a while to open up. She's found that sharing stories about life in the jungle with Kalaggi comes naturally, though, and Muruwa considers the Ekujae elf to be her closest friend at the academy.</p>",

                    "value": "<p><em>Gripplis are a shy and cautious people who generally seek to avoid being drawn into the complicated and dangerous affairs of others. Despite their outlook and small stature, gripplis often take bold and noble action when the situation demands it.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Reclusive and canny, gripplis are treetop survivalists who harvest their homes' bounty and defend themselves against terrible threats. Their reliance on cunning and simple tools has led to gripplis being mischaracterized as primitive, yet this overlooks their shaping of the land with hidden orchards and camouflaged causeways that allow gripplis to live in prosperous peace. Gripplis are most likely to emerge from their forest homes to trade, explore, and combat threats that would despoil the world.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Seek out clever ways to exploit your environment when overcoming challenges.</li>\n<li>Make friends slowly, concerned by cautionary tales of exploitative strangers.</li>\n<li>Be fiercely protective of your home or community.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you dislike cities and people who live in them.</li>\n<li>Trust in your impartial, measured approach to understanding situations and solving problems.</li>\n<li>Give you space, fearing that touching you would prove toxic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Gripplis resemble humanoid tree frogs, with oversized eyes, wide mouths, and gangly physiques. Their slight frames and large toes afford excellent grip while climbing, while their colorful skin provides reliable camouflage that varies by their home environment-green and brown for jungle-dwelling groups, blue and orange for riparian communities, and many other colors between. A grippli grows quickly, reaching adult size of about 2 feet in height about 3 years after hatching, though they're only considered adults around age 12. Gripplis rarely live beyond 60 years, though exceptional individuals occasionally live as long as a century.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Gripplis lead a sophisticated hunter-gatherer lifestyle with which they reshape the landscape to suit their needs: building spillways to trap fish, seeding fruit-bearing trees, sowing cover-granting foliage for future hunts, and more techniques that often escape an agriculturist's eye. These strategies rely on community cooperation as well as dispersed populations, so gripplis commonly live in small villages, each part of a complex web of alliances and relationships. Reclusiveness has preserved grippli lives and lifestyles for millennia, yet they increasingly find themselves threatened by ancient evils and new explorers alike.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Taught to wait, observe, and respect natural processes of life and death, many gripplis adopt neutral alignments. Those who take a more active role suppressing evils that take refuge in the jungles are often neutral good, most notably those rare fiend-keepers who absorb an evil being into their soul to contain and eventually transform its villainy through virtuous acts. Nature deities such as Gozreh or Erastil often earn gripplis' respect, yet communities often prefer less prominent, more intimate divinities such as empyreal lords, psychopomp ushers, or the fey Eldest.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Grippli names often include resonant vowels and chirped consonants that remain difficult for non-gripplis to vocalize properly. Gripplis that travel widely often adopt one or more names more easily replicated by their associates.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Aalpo'ol, Bogwynne, Ctaprak, Eegru, Gpoun, Gruoksh, Hrrauti, Iopo, Iykiki, Kyrsiik, Mhruugu, Oplugo, Quaasol, Yolkuu, Ztaal</p>"

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Rogue Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a rogue class feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Rogue's Racket</h2>\n<p>As you started on the path of the rogue, you began to develop your own style to pursue your illicit activities. Your racket shapes your rogue techniques and the way you approach a job, while building your reputation in the criminal underworld for a certain type of work. A client with deep pockets might even hire a team of rogues for a particular heist, each specializing in a different racket, in order to cover all the bases.

At 1st level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sneak Attack</h2>\n<p>When your enemy can't properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage. If you Strike a creature that has the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, or a ranged weapon attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse.</p>\n<p>As your rogue level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Surprise Attack</h2>\n<p>You spring into combat faster than foes can react. On the first round of combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven't acted are flat-footed to you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Deny Advantage<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>As someone who takes advantage of others' defenses, you are careful not to leave such openings yourself. You aren't flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the initial ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Tricks<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly familiar with the tools of your trade.
