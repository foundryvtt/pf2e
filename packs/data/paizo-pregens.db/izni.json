While she grudgingly turns over her fair share of the harvest to the tribe when its ready, Izni sells her surplus mushrooms to other underground creatures for a tidy profit. She dreams of somehow making her way into Absalom&rsquo;s above-ground markets and purchasing the exciting and strange mushrooms that the human citizens eat. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The only creature Izni seems to like very much is a large, fluffy cat named Precious, which Izni rescued from a burlap sack. Izni claims that Precious was once heir to a noble&rsquo;s fortune before the family butler disposed of her in order to steal the inheritance. The other kobolds don&rsquo;t quite understand Izni&rsquo;s affection for a fuzzy mammal, but Izni insists that Precious is a small draconic creature just like kobolds, as evidenced by such draconic traits as arrogance, overpowering charisma, and endless spite.</span></p>",

They are ingenious crafters and devoted allies within their warrens, but those who trespass into their territory find them to be inspired skirmishers, especially when they have the backing of a draconic sorcerer or true dragon overlord. However, these reptilian opportunists prove happy to cooperate with other humanoids when it's to their benefit, combining caution and cunning to make their fortunes in the wider world.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Kobolds are resourceful survivors whose snare-guarded warrens and opportunistic scavenging have cast them as villains to most other humanoids, with their draconic reverence lending them a reputation as mere minions and nuisances. Yet some kobolds have emerged from their secluded warrens seeking the relative safety of surface settlements, the lucrative prospects of the adventuring life, or validating awe from followers of their own.</p>\n<p>If you want a character with oversized confidence, deadly cunning, and the ancient power of dragons flowing through their veins, you should play a kobold.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Take pride in your draconic connections, whether you believe dragons are your ancestors or simply patrons.</li>\n<li>Analyze your surroundings, always looking for ambushes, advantageous terrain, and escape routes.</li>\n<li>Naturally observe, adopt, and respect group dynamics, whether as leader, subordinate, or equal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume that you are cowardly and won't stick around in the face of danger.</li>\n<li>Appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness, especially when it comes to building defenses.</li>\n<li>Consider your claims of draconic power to be overblown, delusional, or endearing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kobolds are short (about 3 feet tall) reptilian humanoids with slender bodies and long tails. They often boast distant draconic ancestry, and every kobold displays one or more draconic features, such as stout horns, razor-sharp teeth, or—more rarely—vestigial wings or draconic breath. They mature quickly, reaching adulthood by about 12 years and living to about 60.</p>\n<p>The color of a kobold's scales can vary widely. Most often, they mimic the hues of chromatic or metallic dragons, with a mix of slightly darker or lighter scales that create a mottled appearance. The scales of newly hatched kobolds often reflect the community's draconic exemplar, whether that's the dragon they currently serve or the dragon type from which they're descended.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Kobolds have an ingrained cautiousness that keeps them alive. They're secretive or subservient around powerful creatures to avoid becoming victims. This meekness fades once kobolds secure either a formidable patron (like a dragon) or a potent source of supernatural power (like an artifact or sorcerous leader). They often achieve an unshakable fervor and loyalty to their new cause or leader. However, kobolds are infamous for sensing a proverbial sinking ship, and once their source of power fails or seems doomed, their morale breaks swiftly.</p>\n<p>Whether led by a dragon or not, kobolds almost always identify themselves with a type of dragon that serves as their spiritual exemplar. Their societies regularly adopt laws and cultural norms inspired by the exemplar's personality.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>All but the most iconoclastic kobolds have a natural respect for hierarchies and rules, and so kobolds are rarely chaotic. Kobold adventurers tend to be lawful neutral or neutral, relying on their ancestral social strategies for survival.</p>\n<p>Organized religion feels natural for most kobolds, especially when a deity assumes a commanding or tyrannical disposition. Many gravitate toward Abadar's order or Shelyn's artistic flair. More sinister communities uphold Asmodeus and other archdevils as common patrons. The dragon deities Apsu and Dahak are also common subjects of worship. Kobolds also often find themselves drawn to cults, particularly those with dragons or devils as figureheads.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Kobolds often adventure in pursuit of the power, lore, and treasure that they feel befit their disproportionately large egos. When adventurers, militias, or careless tyrants shatter a kobold community, the survivors often latch onto new families, seeking emotional solace—and sometimes revenge. Typical kobold backgrounds include artisan, artist, criminal, hunter, miner, scout, and tinker from the Core Rulebook, plus bandit, cultist, scavenger, and servant from this book. Kobolds excel as bards, rangers, rogues, and sorcerers, though they also often channel their ingenuity as alchemists or wizards.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>A young kobold's given name is rarely more than a syllable or two. However, as they age, achieve status, and accomplish great deeds, kobolds add more syllables to their names, imitating a common draconic practice. Kobolds rarely have surnames except in an effort to better fit into a community, in which case they typically adopt the surname of an inspiring figure in that group.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Azrnak, Draahzin, Enga, Fazgyn, Fazij, Jekkajak, Kib, Kirrok, Mirkol, Tarka, Urkak, Varshez, Vroklan, Zekstikah, Zgaz</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>PFS Note</strong>: Due to years of successful Pathfinder Society activities, all characters have access to the kobold ancestry.</p>"

It can provide endless bounty and breathtaking splendor to those who respect it - and an agonizing death to those who take it too lightly. You are one of those who hear nature's call. You stand in awe of the majesty of its power and give yourself over to its service.</em><br /><br /><strong>Key Ability: WISDOM</strong><br />At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Wisdom.<br /><br /><strong>Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier</strong><br />You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>\n<h1>Roleplaying the Druid</h1>\n<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You call upon the forces of nature to defeat your enemies and protect your allies. You cast spells that draw upon primal magic to protect yourself and your friends, heal their wounds, or summon deadly animals to fight at your side. Depending on your bond to nature, you might call upon powerful elemental magic or change shape into a terrifying beast.</p>\n<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You represent balance and a reasoned approach to problems, looking for solutions that not only are best for the natural world, but also allow the creatures within it to live in harmony and peace. You often propose compromises that allow both sides to gain what they truly need, even if they can't have all that they desire.</p>\n<h2>While Exploring...</h2>\n<p>Your nature skills are invaluable. You track down enemies, navigate the wilderness, and use spells to detect magical auras around you. You might even ask wild animals to lend their extraordinary senses and scouting abilities to your group.</p>\n<h2>In Downtime...</h2>\n<p>You might craft magic items or potions. Alternatively, your tie to nature might lead you to tend a wilderness area, befriending beasts and healing the wounds caused by civilization. You might even teach sustainable farming and animal husbandry techniques that allow others to subsist off the land without harming the natural balance.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a deep and meaningful respect for the power of nature.</li>\n<li>Be in constant awe of the natural world, eager to share it with others but wary of their influence upon it.</li>\n<li>Treat plants and animals as allies, working with them to reach your goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>View you as a representative of nature, and are sure you can control it.</li>\n<li>Assume you're a recluse who avoids society and cities and prefers to live in the wild.</li>\n<li>Consider you a mystic, similar to a priest, but answering only to the forces of nature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Atone]{Atone} ritual.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">The following acts are anathema to all druids:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using metal armor or shields.</li>\n<li>Despoiling natural places.</li>\n<li>Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Each druidic order also has additional anathema acts, detailed in the order's entry.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">See specific orders for more information.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.</p>\n<h2>Druidic Language</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">You know Druidic, a secret language known to only druids, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. Druidic has its own alphabet. Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids is anathema.</p>\n<h2>Druidic Order</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell (see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your order. While you'll always be a member of your initial order, it's not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in search of greater understanding of the natural world, and PC druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of different orders.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots to cast, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Selecting druid feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear in Chapter 7 on page 300.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Orders can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Animal Order]{Animal}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Leaf Order]{Leaf}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Storm Order]{Storm}, and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Wild Order]{Wild}).</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies, representing your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Primal Spellcasting</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">The power of the wild world flows through you. You can cast primal spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells on page 302). Because you're a druid, you can usually hold a primal focus (such as holly and mistletoe) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list in this book, or from other primal spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3-11: Druid Spells per Day on page 132.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a druid. For example, as a 1st-level druid, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level druid, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table style=\"height: 356px; width: 540px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"color: white;

Focus spells don't require spell slots to cast, and you can't cast them using spell slots.

This targets all living and undead creatures in the burst.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8.</p>"
