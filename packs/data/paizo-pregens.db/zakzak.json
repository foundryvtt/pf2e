Zakzak relentlessly pestered anyone who might tell him more about those fabled goblins who bravely battled the undead hordes of the Whispering Tyrant. These goblins rescued the hapless humans of Lastwall and escorting them to Absalom, where the humans gratefully rewarded the goblins by giving them the glorious Puddles district, a region of the city already filled with sturdy houses and even a castle for the goblins and their newly proclaimed king. Surrounded by such stories of goblin glory, Zakzak pushed himself constantly, crafting a firearm of unparalleled might in the form of his flingflenser, forged from scraps he scrounged himself from Absalom's back alleys.</p>\n<p>But even a mighty goblin with an even-mightier weapon needs an adventure before he can make his name. Hearing the stories of the gunslingers of Alkenstar, Zakzak boarded a ship for the port of Quantium, hoping to find passage from there on to Alkenstar. During the journey, Zakzak made an unlikely friend: an elven sniper named Zindarel. Despite the Jinin elf's best efforts to discourage the goblin, Zakzak knew a loner in need of a friend if ever he saw one. By the time their ship reached port the two had forged a bond that Zakzak knew was a lifelong friendship and that Zindarel found surprisingly tolerable. Together, the two traveled on to Alkenstar in search of adventure and opportunity.</p>",

The wars of a few decades ago might as well be from the ancient past. Misunderstood by other people, goblins are happy how they are. Goblin virtues are about being present, creative, and honest. They strive to lead fulfilled lives, rather than worrying about how their journeys will end. To tell stories, not nitpick the facts. To be small, but dream big.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Goblins have a reputation as simple creatures who love songs, fire, and eating disgusting things and who hate reading, dogs, and horses—and there are a great many for whom this description fits perfectly. However, great changes have come to goblinkind, and more and more goblins resist conformity to these stereotypes. Even among goblins that are more worldly, many still exemplify their old ways in some small manner, just to a more sensible degree. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire or fearlessly devour a meal that might turn others' stomachs. Others are endless tinkerers and view their companions' trash as the components of gadgets yet to be made.</p>\n<p>Though goblins' culture has splintered radically, their reputation has changed little. As such, goblins who travel to larger cities are frequently subjected to derision, and many work twice as hard at proving their worth.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is eccentric, enthusiastic, and fun-loving, you should play a goblin.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to prove that you have a place among other civilized peoples, perhaps even to yourself.</li>\n<li>Fight tooth and nail—sometimes literally—to protect yourself and your friends from danger.</li>\n<li>Lighten the heavy emotional burdens others carry (and amuse yourself) with antics and pranks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Work to ensure you don't accidentally (or intentionally) set too many things on fire.</li>\n<li>Assume you can't—or won't—read.</li>\n<li>Wonder how you survive given your ancestry's typical gastronomic choices, reckless behavior, and love of fire.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Goblins are stumpy humanoids with large bodies, scrawny limbs, and massively oversized heads with large ears and beady red eyes. Their skin ranges from green to gray to blue, and they often bear scars, boils, and rashes. Goblins average 3 feet tall. Most are bald, with little or no body hair. Their jagged teeth fall out and regrow constantly, and their fast metabolism means they eat constantly and nap frequently. Mutations are also more common among goblins than other peoples, and goblins usually view particularly salient mutations as a sign of power or fortune.</p>\n<p>Goblins reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood 4 or 5 years later. Goblins can live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Goblins tend to flock to strong leaders, forming small tribes. These tribes rarely number more than a hundred, though the larger a tribe is, the more diligent the leader must be to keep order—a notoriously difficult task. As new threats rise across the Inner Sea region, many tribal elders have put aside their reckless ways in the hope of forging alliances that offer their people a greater chance at survival. Play and creativity matter more to goblins than productivity or study, and their encampments erupt with songs and laughter.</p>\n<p>Goblins bond closely with their allies, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them or offered a sympathetic ear. Goblins tend to assume for their own protection that members of taller ancestries, which goblins often refer to colloquially as 'longshanks,' won't treat them kindly. Learning to trust longshanks is difficult for a goblin, and it's been only in recent years that such a partnership has even been an option. However, their attitude as a people is changing rapidly, and their short lifespans and poor memories help them adapt quickly.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Even well-intentioned goblins have trouble following the rules, meaning they're rarely lawful. Most goblin adventurers are chaotic neutral or chaotic good. Organized worship confounds goblins, and most of them would rather pick their own deities, choosing powerful monsters, natural wonders, or anything else they find fascinating. Longshanks might have books upon books about the structures of divinity, but to a goblin, anything can be a god if you want it to. Goblins who spend time around people of other ancestries might adopt some of their beliefs, though, and many goblin adventurers adopt the worship of Cayden Cailean.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>To some degree, almost every goblin is an adventurer, surviving life on the edge using skill and wits. Goblins explore and hunt for treasures by nature, though some become true adventurers in their own rights, often after being separated from their group or tribe.</p>\n<p>Goblins often have the acrobat, criminal, entertainer, gladiator, hunter, and street urchin backgrounds. Consider playing an alchemist, since many goblins love fire, or a bard, since many goblins love songs. As scrappy survivors, goblins are often rogues who dart about the shadows, though their inherently charismatic nature also draws them to the pursuit of magical classes such as sorcerer.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Goblins keep their names simple. A good name should be easy to pronounce, short enough to shout without getting winded, and taste good to say. The namer often picks a word that rhymes with something they like so that writing songs is easier. Since there aren't any real traditions regarding naming in goblin culture, children often name themselves once they're old enough to do something resembling talking.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Ak, Bokker, Frum, Guzmuk, Krobby, Loohi, Mazmord, Neeka, Omgot, Ranzak, Rickle, Tup, Wakla, Yonk, Zibini</p>"

At 1st level, your way grants you an initial deed, a unique reload action called a slinger's reload, and proficiency with a particular skill. You also gain advanced and greater deeds at later levels, as well as access to way-specific feats. The gunslinger ways are described in detail on page 108. The following ways are presented in this book.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Drifter</strong> You wander across the battlefield, equally at home in and out of the fray.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Pistolero</strong> You carefully maintain your distance at a duelist's 10 paces with pistol in hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Sniper</strong> You practice a methodical style of shooting, striking from far cover.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Vanguard</strong> You rely on a brutal combat style that uses heavy weapons and explosive attacks.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinger Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a gunslinger class feat.</p>\n<h2>Singular Expertise</h2>\n<p>You have particular expertise with guns and crossbows that grants you greater proficiency with them and the ability to deal more damage. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage rolls with firearms and crossbows.</p>\n<p>This intense focus on firearms and crossbows prevents you from reaching the same heights with other weapons. Your proficiency with unarmed attacks and with weapons other than firearms and crossbows can't be higher than trained, even if you gain an ability that would increase your proficiency in one or more other weapons to match your highest weapon proficiency (such as the weapon expertise feats many ancestries have). If you have gunslinger weapon mastery, the limit is expert, and if you have gunslinging legend, the limit is master.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Stubborn<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You don't like being told what to do, and you don't give up. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert. When you fail, but don't critically fail, a Will save against an effect that would give you the controlled condition, you can attempt a second save against the effect at the start of your next turn. On a successful second save, the controlled condition ends, though any other effects remain. As normal, failing this second save doesn't allow you to attempt a third save on the subsequent turn.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinger Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand the best way to utilize your unique weapons. Your proficiency rank increases to master with simple and martial firearms and crossbows. Your proficiency rank for advanced firearms and crossbows, simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects for firearms and crossbows.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Deed<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned a powerful new technique of your chosen way. You gain the advanced deed ability of the way you chose at 1st level.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinger Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your special shots become harder for opponents to predict or resist. Your proficiency rank for your gunslinger class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinging Legend<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned unique techniques for wielding firearms and crossbows that give you unmatched skill in their use. Your proficiency rank increases to legendary with simple and martial firearms and crossbows and to master with advanced firearms and crossbows. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Greater Deed<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You've mastered the pinnacle technique of your chosen way. You gain the greater deed ability of the way you chose at 1st level.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your body has become accustomed to physical hazards and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Shootist's Edge<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You make shots others find impossible. Your proficiency rank for your gunslinger class DC increases to master. When using a ranged weapon in which you have master or greater proficiency, you ignore the penalty for attacking within the weapon's second and third range increments.</p>\n<h2>Incredible Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You notice things that most people can't detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge or absorb blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to master.</p>"
