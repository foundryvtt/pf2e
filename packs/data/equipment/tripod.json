            "value": "<p>Tripods are designed for use with kickback weapons, as a way for gunslingers with lower strength to accurately use these more powerful weapons by sacrificing mobility instead. They can be set up and attached to a firearm with a single Interact action using one hand, setting the tripod in your square. While this sturdy piece of engineering is in use, you don't take the -2 penalty for firing a kickback weapon, even if your Strength isn't high enough to avoid the penalty. However, you must retrieve the tripod with a single Interact action before you can move the firearm to a different position. Normally, when you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Undetected], you become observed if you do anything except @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Hide], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sneak], or Step. However, deploying or retrieving a tripod with an Interact action doesn't automatically make you observed, so long as you don't set up or remove the tripod when it's in a spot where creatures can see the tripod itself.</p>"
