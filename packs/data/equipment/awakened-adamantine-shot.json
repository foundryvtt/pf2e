The awakened adamantine breaks through any resistance. The shot ignores the first 20 resistance a creature has to physical damage, all damage, or piercing or bludgeoning damage. Against a golem or creature who already has a resistance bypassed by adamantine, or a weakness to adamantine, the shot shatters the target's defenses, causing them to become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Flat-Footed] for 1 minute instead. Because adamantine is uncommon, this version of awakened metal shot is uncommon even for gunslingers or other characters with access to uncommon guns and bullets from this book.</p>"
