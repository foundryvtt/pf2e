If the victim dies while affected by this poison, its body decomposes to nothing in 1 minute, leaving only its gear behind. Non-magical preservation can't protect the tainted corpse. Gentle repose works on the poisoned body only if cast as a 5th-level spell and the caster succeeds at a counteract check against the poison's saving throw DC when casting the spell. Even if cast successfully, gentle repose only works as if it had been cast at 2nd level.</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> @Check[type:fortitude|dc:42]</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Duration</strong> 6 rounds</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> [[/r 7d12[poison]]] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed]{Doomed 1} (1 round)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> [[/r 9d12[poison]]] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed]{Doomed 2} (1 round)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong> [[/r 11d12[poison]]] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed]{Doomed 3} (1 round)</p>"
