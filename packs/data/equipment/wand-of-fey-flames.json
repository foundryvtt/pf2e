For the duration of the spell, you can use the limning flames as a source for your magic. Creatures affected by your <em>faerie fire</em> must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or take a - 2 status penalty to their Will saves against enchantment and illusions spells as long as they are affected by <em>faerie fire</em>. You can cast an enchantment or illusion spell on such a creature up to a distance twice the spell's normal range. If the spell has a range of touch, or doesn't have a range, it is unaffected by the increase in range from the <em>faerie fire</em>.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Wand of Fey Flames]</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> Supply a casting of faerie fire.</p>"
