As long as you're holding a vaporous pipe, you don't take a circumstance penalty to Perception checks due to thick smoke, and you can't suffocate from smoke and heated air (such as within a wildfire). As long as you are holding the pipe, you also gain resistance to fire equal to half your level.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You draw on the pipe and then blow a massive cloud of smoke that fills a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30] that includes your space. All creatures within the smoke cloud are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] from each other and from creatures outside the smoke, though you can still see clearly within it. The smoke dissipates after 3 rounds, or after 1 round if subjected to a strong wind.</p>"
