While wearing the mask, you gain a +1 item bonus to Deception checks to Lie and the mask doesn't impair your vision. The mask can also be activated, with an ability based on its type.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This mask is a patchwork of tanned skins, each with a distinctive scar. It is contorted into a caricature of a face with a leering eye.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">r</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You deal persistent bleed damage to a creature</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The bleeding wound you cause is particularly mutilating. The DC of flat checks to recover from the persistent bleed damage is increased by 2, and the target creature has a -2 status penalty to Deception, Diplomacy, and Performance checks while it is bleeding and for 1 minute after it ceases bleeding.</p>"
