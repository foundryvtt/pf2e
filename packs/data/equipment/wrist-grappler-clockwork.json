The wrist grappler and pack are small enough that they can be concealed with a loose jacket or similar piece of clothing. You can deploy or stow the gun from the attached wrist device with an Interact action. Reloading a clockwork wrist grappler uses the same process as reloading a clockwork grappling gun and takes 3 actions.</p>"
