You can rapidly deploy it on the ground with an Interact action to create cover. Deployable cover is large enough to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Take Cover] behind, allowing you (and others) to gain standard cover when you use the Take Cover action. Before it can be used again, deployable cover must be carefully folded and clamped shut, which takes 1 minute.</p>"
