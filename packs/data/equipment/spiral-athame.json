            "value": "<p>The pommel of this <em>+4 major striking disruptive ghost touch high-grade silver dagger</em> is a black glass orb that contains a tiny blue comet that spirals through the orb's interior. Strikes with the dagger deal an additional [[/r 1d8[positive]]] damage to worshippers of Urgathoa and to anyone who has ever created or summoned an undead creature. While the dagger is in your possession, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Medicine checks and to Midwifery Lore checks. If you're a worshipper of Pharasma, you gain imprecise lifesense with a range of 60 feet while holding the dagger. If you're undead or a worshipper of Urgathoa, you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 4} while holding the dagger.</p>\n<p>Despite its utility in combat, the <em>Spiral Athame</em> is intended as a ritual implement, meant to bless newborns and protect them from the predations of undead. If you use the <em>Spiral Athame</em> to cut the umbilical cord of a newly born creature, that creature gains resistance to negative damage equal to their level (minimum 1) and gains a +2 status bonus to saving throws against death effects and necromancy. These bonuses are permanent. Additionally, that creature can never become an undead creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> command, Interact (divine, necromancy)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You point the <em>Spiral Athame</em> at a corpse within 30 feet, shielding it from corruption.
