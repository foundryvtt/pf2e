The creeping pattern is carved so they seem to move and contort the more one views the figurine. When activated, the effect is amplified to a disgusting or horrifying degree. The figurine can be activated twice per day. If you try to activate it a third time during a day, it dissolves into a puddle of non-magical, putrid glue, causing you to become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 3}.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> command, Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Holding the figurine over your head and speaking one command word causes a wave of nausea in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:20].
