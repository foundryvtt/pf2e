            "value": "<p><em>Briar</em> was formed ages ago by the Eldest when they tore from Nyrissa's mind and spirit her capability to love, then solidified this emotional energy into a sword. They entrusted <em>Briar's</em> safe keeping to the Lantern King, who mischievously kept moving the sword from world to world, always near to the regions Nyrissa was focused on but always hidden from her so that he could privately enjoy the delicious irony that the thing she sought so ardently was always kept just out of reach.</p>\n<p>When first recovered by the PCs, Briar is a <em>+3 greater striking cold iron bastard sword</em>, but its additional powers remain dormant. These powers can be awakened as the PCs progress through Chapter 10. The process of awakening Briar requires that the weapon be present when First World blooms are defeated or when powerful creatures from the First World are slain-<em>Briar</em> need not be the weapon that defeats a bloom or slays a monster, but it must be in the immediate area (within 500 feet). Defeating a bloom or slaying a 17th-level or greater monster from the First World- including all creatures closely associated with a bloom-gives <em>Briar</em> a Sharpness Point. As it accumulates these points, it gains additional powers, as detailed below.</p>\n<p>Once <em>Briar</em> gains the capability to speak, it can relate to its partner the sad tale of its creation, including the fact that it was created by the Lantern King using Nyrissa's capacity to love. <em>Briar</em> knows that without love, Nyrissa is as good as dead, and it suspects that only by being used to slay Nyrissa can it be returned to her soul. It doesn't know about the Lantern King's additional machinations, the nature of the <em>Apology</em>, or Nyrissa's reasons for attacking the Stolen Lands, and as such doesn't realize there is another method to be reunited with the nymph queen-see the end of Chapter 10. The first time <em>Briar</em> is brought within 30 feet of Nyrissa, it automatically gains enough Sharpness Points to reach 20 points.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>1 Sharpness Point</strong> <em>Briar</em> becomes a +3 greater striking shifting cold iron bastard sword.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>4 Sharpness Points</strong> <em>Briar</em> becomes a <em>+3 major striking shifting cold iron bastard sword</em>.
