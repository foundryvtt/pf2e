            "value": "<p>This simple brass ring is meant to be worn as an ornamentation piece to an outfit, oftentimes as a bangle on the wrist, as the ring closure of a scarf or sash, or as an ornamentation piece of a headdress. While decorative, this serves a cover for the bangle's function as a message bearer. Messages can be coded into the bangle, either through a series of raised dots and dashes or a pattern of notches of different depths and spacings. A bangle is large enough to hold a simple message consisting of a few words like \"Danger. Flee.\" or \"Meeting. Sunset. Fountain.\"</p>\n<p>Coding a message into a bangle requires 1 minute of time. All Pathfinders with access to communication bangles are taught how to code and read most basic messages, but anyone with a bangle can develop their own communication system.</p>\n<p>A creature inspecting a bangle can discover its true purpose by succeeding at a @Check[type:perception|dc:20|traits:action:seek] check. Deciphering a message requires a creature to succeed at a Society check against the coder's Deception DC.</p>"
