A creature that takes damage from the spell is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Blinded] for 1 round and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] for a number of rounds equal to the spell level. On a critical success on the attack roll, the target is also blinded for as long as it's dazzled from the spell. However, it can attempt a Fortitude saving throw against your spell DC at the end of each of its turns, ending the blinded condition on a success (but remaining dazzled).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Craft Requirements Supply a casting of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Searing Light]</em> of the appropriate level.</p>"
