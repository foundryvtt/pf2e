It encourages you to learn new fire spells to inscribe within its pages. When you attempt a skill check to Learn a Spell to add a spell with the fire trait to the kindled tome, you treat your result as one step better than you rolled. The tome can be disparaging about other spells as \"a waste of good page space,\" especially if those spells have the cold or water traits. In addition to the activation of a book of lingering blazes, a kindled tome has the following activations.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">r</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You Cast a Spell with the fire trait</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The tome makes the flames linger, dealing [[/r 2d6[persistent,fire]]] to all you hit with or who fail the saving throw against the effect (doubling on a critical success on a spell attack and on a critical failure on a saving throw).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> command, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The tome casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Fireball]</em> at 5th level to your specifications.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> envision (metamagic)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> If your next action is to cast an evocation spell dealing fire damage that you prepared from this grimoire, you superheat the flames, allowing the spell to ignore up to 10 resistance to fire of creatures affected by the spell.</p>"
