On the inside, intricate runic diagrams spiral out to surround the scroll stored within. A scroll placed within the case can be converted into energy to cast consistently useful spells depending on its type. You must be able to cast spells of a given tradition to use a <em>scroll case of simplicity</em> of a corresponding type.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">A</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The scroll case contains a single scroll of a 1st-level spell</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You transfer the scroll's energy into the scroll case, consuming the scroll, and you can immediately begin casting one of the scroll case's spells. If you use any action other than to Cast a Spell from the scroll case after activating the <em>scroll case of simplicity</em>, the scroll and its energy are lost.</p>\n<p>The scroll case can be used to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Longstrider]</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Pass Without Trace]</em></p>"
