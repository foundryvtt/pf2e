A steam winch allows you to slowly pull a heavy load (usually up to 50 Bulk) along a flat surface or up and down a vertical expanse.</p>\n<p>Attaching a steam winch to a device takes three Interact actions, while starting the winch (and getting it warm enough to operate) takes 10 minutes. Once in operation, a steam winch requires regular maintenance to function. Every twenty minutes, the boiler must be refilled and heat levels maintained</p>"
