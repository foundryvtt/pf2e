            "value": "<p>Made of a deep-brown rosewood, a spurned lute is adorned with carved flowers. The lute appears to be and functions as a virtuoso instrument. (Other spurned instruments exist, but the lute is the least rare.) This lute has a jealous streak, demanding total loyalty from its \"partner\" musician. After you play the lute for the first time, it fuses to you. If you go a day without using it to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Perform], you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} until you next do so. After that, when you attempt a Performance check using an instrument other than the lute, you take a –4 circumstance penalty to do so, and you must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:20] save or become stupefied 1 for 1 minute.</p>"
