The target is affected by the viper's poison, as if it had been bitten. The viper then lands in an open space adjacent to the target.</p>\n<p>The viper has the summoned trait and acts at the end of your turn, even though you didn't use the Sustain a Spell action. It is under the GM's control, but it generally attacks the creature the arrow struck. The viper vanishes after 1 minute or when slain.</p>\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> Supply one casting of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Summon Animal]</em></p>"
