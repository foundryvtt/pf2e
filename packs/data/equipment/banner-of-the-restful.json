Usually, the banner appears to be a piece of plain cloth; when activated, it automatically adopts whatever insignia the person activating it desires.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 10 minutes (command, envision, Interact)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You plant the banner firmly in the ground, and a comfortable environment is created around it in a 20-foot radius. Those within the area are shielded against your choice of hot or cold temperatures, gaining the effects of 1st-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Endure Elements]</em>. The area created by the banner lasts for 8 hours or until it is removed from the ground.</p>\n<p>As part of the activation, you can choose to ward the same area with an <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Alarm]</em> spell. In addition to a mental alert for the person who Activates the banner, the alert sent by the <em>alarm</em> spell also includes an audible alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell, which has the auditory trait. You choose the password as you decide to ward the area.</p>"
