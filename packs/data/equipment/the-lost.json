A character can spend eight hours in Downtime here to focus on this loss and emptiness, taking those realities into themselves to emerge changed, with entirely new memories—be they old memories recovered for the first time or newly created memories. At the end of these eight hours, the PC can instantly Retrain a single feat, skill, or class feature, as if they had spent the normal amount of time required for that downtime activity. All the other normal restrictions for retraining apply. A PC can only use The Lost to retrain in this way once per level.</p>",
