After either reaction has been used, the remaining mucus loses its reactive properties and falls away as the effect ends. You can only have one dose applied at a time. If you don't use either reaction, after 10 minutes, the mucus flakes away and the effect ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">r</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You hit a creature with a melee Strike</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You fling mucus on the creature, dealing [[/r 1d4[persistent,poison]]].</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">r</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You are hit with a melee attack that deals physical damage</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The mucus dulls the blow, granting you resistance 3 to physical damage against the triggering attack.</p>"
