A spellcaster can spend 1 minute to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Cast a Spell] of 3rd level or lower into the shield. The spell must take 2 actions or fewer to cast and must be able to target a creature other than the caster. The spell has no immediate effect-it's instead stored for later. When you invest a <em>spell-bastion</em> shield, you immediately know the name and level of the stored spell.
