While in this form, you can attack with the <em>fanged</em> weapon even though you don't have any hands. However, you can attack only with the <em>fanged</em> weapon and you don't have hands or the ability to hold items. For effects dependent on how many hands you are using to hold the item, such as the two-hand trait, you are holding the weapon in two hands. You can Dismiss this effect, and it ends automatically if you drop the <em>fanged</em> weapon (whether or not of your own volition).</p>\n<p>In animal form, you gain low-light vision, imprecise scent to a range of 30 feet, and a +10-foot item bonus to your Speed.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Major Fanged Rune Animal Form]</p>"
