Only two exist, making them almost unique, and the means to create more have been stymied, as some of the crucial inventors were killed in the process of attempting to design a follow-up technology, a smaller but more powerful suit of mechanized armor called the Grobelarch that ultimately went berserk and killed its creators.</p>",
