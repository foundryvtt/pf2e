You know how to live off the land and are skilled at spotting and taking down both opportune prey and hated enemies.</em><br /><br /><strong>Key Ability: STRENGTH OR DEXTERITY</strong><br />At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity.<br /><br /><strong>Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier</strong><br />You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>\n<h1>Roleplaying the Ranger</h1>\n<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You can single out particular foes to hunt, making you better at defeating them.

You gain the Hunt Prey action.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Hunt Prey]{Hunt Prey} <span class=\"pf2-icon\">A</span></h3>\n<hr />\n<p>You designate a single creature as your prey and focus your attacks against that creature. You must be able to see or hear the prey, or you must be tracking the prey during exploration.</p>\n<p>You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks when you Seek your prey and a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks when you Track your prey. You also ignore the penalty for making ranged attacks within your second range increment against the prey you're hunting.</p>\n<p>You can have only one creature designated as your prey at a time. If you use Hunt Prey against a creature when you already have a creature designated, the prior creature loses the designation and the new prey gains the designation. Your designation lasts until your next daily preparations.</p>\n<h2>Hunter's Edge</h2>\n<p>You have trained for countless hours to become a more skilled hunter and tracker, gaining an additional benefit when you Hunt Prey depending on the focus of your training. Choose a hunter's edge.</p>\n<p>Hunter's edges can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Hunter's Edge: Flurry]{Hunter's Edge: Flurry}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Hunter's Edge: Outwit]{Hunter's Edge: Outwit} and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Hunter's Edge: Precision]{Hunter's Edge: Precision}).</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training.

You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Iron Will<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Your training has hardened your resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Ranger Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all such weapons and unarmed attacks when attacking your hunted prey.</p>\n<h2>Trackless Step<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>When you move through natural terrains, you are difficult to track. You always gain the benefits of the Cover Tracks action in such terrains, without moving at half your Speed.</p>\n<h2>Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragons' breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventuring, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Nature's Edge<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You always find the weak points in your foes' defenses when they're on unfavorable terrain. Enemies are flat-footed to you if they're in natural difficult terrain or in difficult terrain resulting from a snare.</p>\n<h2>Ranger Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've practiced your techniques to make them harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your ranger class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments.

Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Wild Stride<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You move quickly through obstacles, whether they're tumbled stone, tangled undergrowth, or sucking mud. You can ignore the effects of non-magical difficult terrain. As normal for ignoring difficult terrain, this also lets you treat the hindrances of greater difficult terrain as those of difficult terrain.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Improved Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your ability to elude danger is matchless. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Incredible Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You notice things almost impossible for an ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Masterful Hunter<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your abilities as a hunter to incredible levels.

You also gain an additional benefit depending on your hunter's edge.</p>\n<p>See specific hunter's edges for more information.</p>\n<h2>Second Skin<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your armor has become akin to a second skin for you. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to master. When wearing light or medium armor, you can rest normally, rather than receiving poor rest that leaves you fatigued.</p>\n<h2>Swift Prey<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You size up your prey with only a glance. You can use Hunt Prey as a free action if it's your first action of your turn.</p>"
