These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>On the Case</h2>\n<p>As an investigator, you think of your adventures as cases waiting to be solved. You gain one activity and one reaction you can use to investigate cases: @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Pursue a Lead]{Pursue a Lead} and @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Clue In]{Clue In}.</p>\n<h2>Devise a Strategem</h2>\n<p>You can play out a battle in your head, using brains rather than brawn to execute an attack.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Devise a Stratagem]{Devise a Strategem}</p>\n<h2>Methodology</h2>\n<p>Your studies have made you savvy in many areas,; but one in particular drew your intense interest.</p>\n<p>Choose a methodology. The methodologies presented in this book are as follow:</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Alchemical Sciences Methodology]{Alchemical Sciences Methodology}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Empiricism Methodology]{Empiricism Methology}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Forensic Medicine Methodology]{Forensic Medicine Methodology}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Interrogation Methodology]{Interrogation Methodology}</p>\n<h2>Investigator Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an investigator class feat.</p>\n<h2>Strategic Strike</h2>\n<p>When you strike carefully and with forethought, you deal a telling blow. When making a Strike that adds your Intelligence modifier on your attack roll due to Devising a Stratagem, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage.</p>\n<p>As your investigator level increases, so too does the deadliness of your strategic strike. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Keen Recollection <span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You can recall pertinent facts on topics that aren't your specialty.

When you find the clue, the GM informs you that you've done so. If there is more than one clue in the location, the GM chooses one to inform you about. When you find any of the clues in that location, the GM informs you that you've done so, even if it wasn't the clue they'd chosen or there are other clues you haven't found.
