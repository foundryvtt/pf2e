You become immobilized, gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex save against area effects, and gain resistance 5 to all damage you would normally take from area effects and scatter splash damage (this doesn't damage the <em>blast suit</em>). These effects persist for as long as the suit remains in the locked position. You can Interact with the suit to unlock it.</p>\n<p><strong>Unimplemented effects:</strong> Resistance to scatter splash damage.</p>"
