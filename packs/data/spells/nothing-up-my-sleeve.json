When you draw an object from the extradimensional storage, the object appears in one of your empty hands. If you don't have an empty hand, you can't draw an object from the extradimensional storage. For the duration, whenever you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Palm an Object], you can choose to place the palmed object directly into one of the two extradimensional spaces if that space has sufficient capacity to hold the object. When the spell ends or you die, the contents of both extradimensional spaces are ejected and land without harm on the ground in your space.</p>"
