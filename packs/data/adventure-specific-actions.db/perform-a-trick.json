If you Perform a Trick twice during the same act, you take a -5 penalty to your second trick check. If you Perform a Trick three times, the penalty for the third check is -10. The penalties are reduced to -4 and -8, respectively, if your trick has the agile trait.</p>\n<p>This action always has the circus trait. Starting at 1st level, you can choose one additional trick trait you have access to for your signature trick, and apply it to this action as well. You can add additional traits as your level increases.</p>"
