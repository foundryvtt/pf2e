This second tactic usually can't succeed unless that skill is one favored by that regent's guild. At the GM's option, you may substitute an applicable Lore skill check for the Diplomacy check. If you attempt a Diplomacy or Lore check, it's a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:32] or @Check[type:lore|dc:32] check for success; if you attempt a favored skill check, it's a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:28] or @Check[type:lore|dc:28] check for success.</p>\n<p>At the GM's option, a player who brings up a compelling point or roleplays particularly well in their attempt to Influence a Regent might gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You reduce the regent's Skepticism by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You reduce the regent's Skepticism by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You do not adjust the regent's Skepticism.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You increase the regent's Skepticism by 1.</p>"
