While the animals can't be organized into an actual army, the PCs can still attempt to use their skills to turn the local fauna to their advantage. Recruiting Wildlife requires a Nature (expert) check. If a PC has Wild Empathy or can cast spells like speak with animals, they can opt to attempt this check using Diplomacy (trained) instead.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The PCs interpret animal reactions to the enemy armies' approach, giving their armies a +3 circumstance bonus on initiative checks made during the Battle for Tatzlford. In addition, at one point during the battle, a pack of hungry brush thylacines attack an enemy army. This attack takes place at the end of a turn chosen by the party, at which point the PCs can attempt a [[/r {1d20+20} #melee strike]]{+20} melee Strike against any non-engaged army. The thylacines do 1 point of damage to that army on a hit (or 2 points on a critical hit) before the animals flee back into the woods.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As success (including the thylacine attack), but the circumstance bonus on initiative checks is only +1.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Not only do the local animals refuse to aid, the PCs actions accidentally send a pack of crazed brush thylacines into town to attack. The Tatzlford Town Guard manages to defeat the attack, but they start the war encounter with 1 point of damage.</p>"
