When you Explore the Vault of Boundless Wonder, attempt a skill check, choosing from the skills indicated in the area you're searching. Other Lore checks might be appropriate at the GM's discretion. The DC of most skill checks is 15 (DC 18 for levels 3-4); for checks using an appropriate Lore skill, lower the DC to 12 (DC 15 for levels 3-4). The overwhelming presence of magic in the vault makes detect magic and similar magic less accurate than usual, but if you use such spells, you gain a +1 status bonus to your check. Based on the results of your check, you might discover something useful.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You make a significant discovery in the area you're searching.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You make a discovery in the area you're searching.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You make a mistaken discovery in the area you're searching.</p>"
