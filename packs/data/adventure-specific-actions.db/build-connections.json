That creature can roll twice and use the better result, after which the favor is considered repaid; calling in the favor is a fortune effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> For 1 week, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your skill checks for the downtime activities listed here.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> A faux pas embarrasses you, and rumors recount the incident widely.
