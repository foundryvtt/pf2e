When a defending army takes the Guard action, it gains a +2 item bonus on its Maneuver check. A barricade can grant this bonus only twice before it is ruined by enemy attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the barricade only works for one Guard action.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> A catastrophic accident occurs! Not only is the barricade ruined, but the PC attempting to erect the barricade takes [[/r 10d6[bludgeoning]]] damage (@Check[type:reflex|dc:25|basic:true]).</p>"
