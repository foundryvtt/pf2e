Attempt an Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, or Performance check, with a DC typically set by the encounter's level. Crowds grow bored with repetition though; and attempting to Pander to the Crowd using the same skill that was used the last time someone used this action imposes a -2 circumstance penalty on the check. If you critically succeeded at an attack roll this turn, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Pander to the Crowd attempt.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The crowd goes wild! You can either give yourself a +3 status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the end of your next turn, or give yourself and all your allies a +2 status bonus to the same rolls until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You appeal to the crowd. As critical success, but the bonus is +2 just for you, or +1 for you and your allies.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You don't make an impression.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your pandering is laughable, and the crowd begins to favor your opponents. The next creature hostile to you that attempts to Pander to the Crowd gains a +4 circumstance bonus to the check.</p>"
