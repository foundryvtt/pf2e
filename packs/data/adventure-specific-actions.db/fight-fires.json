If you use water as part of this action, you gain a +2 item bonus to this check. Alternately, you can use a spell to Fight Fires by attempting a spell attack roll as you Cast, although you'll need to describe how you're using the spell to the GM, who will then decide if the plan has a chance to succeed. If the spell has the Water trait, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this check. Certain spells, at the GM's discretion, may automatically grant a critical success or instantly extinguish the flames.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You gain 2 Extinguish Points.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You gain 1 Extinguish Point.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You lose 1 Extinguish Point.</p>"
