                    "value": "<p><em>As unpredictable and varied as any of Golarion's peoples, humans have exceptional drive and the capacity to endure and expand. Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea. Human characters can be any of these ethnicities, regardless of what lands they call home.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Characters of human ethnicities in the Inner Sea region speak Common (also known as Taldane), and some ethnicities grant access to an uncommon language.</p>"

At the GM's discretion, after succeeding at a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you also gain panache if your result is high enough (typically the very hard DC for your level, but the GM can choose a different threshold).</p>\n<p>While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Tumble Through or to take any actions that give you panache due to your style. The precise strike class feature also causes you to deal extra precision damage while you have panache.

You dart among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Key Ability: DEXTERITY</strong></p>\n<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Dexterity.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>\n<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Roleplaying the Swashbuckler</h1>\n<h2 class=\"title\">During Combat Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Panache</h2>\n<p>You care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular bravado, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This state of flair is called panache, and you are either in a state of panache or you are not.</p>\n<p>You gain panache by successfully performing the skill check associated with specific actions that have a bit of flair, including @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Tumble Through]{Tumble Through} and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler's style (see below). At the GM's discretion, after succeeding at a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you also gain panache if your result is high enough (typically the very hard DC for your level, but the GM can choose a different threshold).</p>\n<p>While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Tumble Through or to take any actions that give you panache due to your style. The precise strike class feature also causes you to deal extra precision damage while you have panache. Powerful finisher actions, including @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Confident Finisher]{Confident Finisher}, can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache.</p>\n<p>Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Swashbuckler's Style</h2>\n<p>As a swashbuckler, you have your own distinctive style that enables you to gracefully handle everyday events and life-or-death situations alike. Choose a swashbuckler's style. This style determines the additional actions you use to gain panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that action. The styles presented in this book are as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Battledancer]{Battledancer}</strong> To you, a fight is a kind of performance art, and you command your foes' attention with mesmerizing motions. You are trained in Performance and gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Fascinating Performance]{Fascinating Performance} skill feat. You gain panache during an encounter when the result of your Performance check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Perform]{Perform}exceeds the Will DC of an observing foe, even if the foe isn't @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Fascinated]{Fascinated}.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Braggart]{Braggart}</strong> You boast, taunt, and psychologically needle your foes. You are trained in Intimidation. You gain panache during an encounter whenever you successfully @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Demoralize]{Demoralize} a foe.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Fencer]{Fencer}</strong> You move carefully, feinting and creating false openings to lead your foes into inopportune attacks. You are trained in Deception. You gain panache during an encounter whenever you successfully @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Feint]{Feint} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Create a Diversion]{Create a Diversion} against a foe.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Gymnast]{Gymnast}</strong> You reposition, maneuver, and bewilder your foes with daring feats of physical prowess. You are trained in Athletics. You gain panache during an encounter whenever you successfully @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Grapple]{Grapple}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Shove]{Shove}, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Trip]{Trip} a foe.</li>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Wit]{Wit}</strong> You are friendly, clever, and full of humor, always knowing just what to say in any situation. Your witticisms leave foes unprepared for the skill and speed of your attacks. You are trained in Diplomacy and gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Bon Mot]{Bon Mot} skill feat. You gain panache during an encounter whenever you succeed at a Bon Mot against a foe.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Precise Strike</h2>\n<p>You strike with flair. When you have panache and you Strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal [[/r 2 #precision]]{2 additional precision damage}. If the strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is [[/r {2d6}[precision]]]{2d6 precision damage} instead.</p>\n<p>As your swashbuckler level increases, so does your additional damage for precise strike. Increase the amount of additional damage on a Strike and the number of additional dice on a finisher by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Confident Finisher</h2>\n<p>You gain an elegant finishing attack you can make when you have panache. You gain the Confident Finisher action.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Swashbuckler Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a swashbuckler class feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Great Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Your physique is incredibly hardy, granting you increased endurance. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Opportune Riposte<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You turn the tables on foes who fumble, capitalizing immediately on their mistake. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Opportune Riposte]{Opportune Riposte} reaction.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Stylish Tricks<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you gain a skill feat. This feat must be for Acrobatics or the trained skill from your swashbuckler's style.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Vivacious Speed<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>When you've made an impression, you move even faster than normal, darting about the battlefield with incredible speed. Increase the status bonus to your Speeds when you have panache to a +10-foot status bonus; this bonus increases by 5 feet at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels. When you don't have panache, you still get half this status bonus to your Speed, rounded down to the nearest 5-foot increment.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all weapons for which you have expert proficiency.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, a dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Exemplary Finisher<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You execute your finishing moves with spectacular flair, adding special effects to your finishers. If a Strike you make as part of a finisher hits a foe, you add one of the following effects to the Strike, depending on your swashbuckler's style.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Battledancer</strong> You can Step as a free action immediately after the finisher.</li>\n<li><strong>Braggart</strong> If the foe was temporarily immune to your Demoralize, their temporary immunity ends.</li>\n<li><strong>Fencer</strong> The foe is flat-footed until your next turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Gymnast</strong> If the foe is grabbed, restrained, or prone, you gain a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to twice the number of weapon damage dice.</li>\n<li><strong>Wit</strong> The foe takes a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Swashbuckler Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You perform swashbuckling techniques with exceptional flair, making them harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your swashbuckler class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Continuous Flair<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>While not equal to the heights of your panache in combat, you have a dramatic flair about you in any situation. Whenever you succeed at a check during exploration that would have granted you panache in combat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to further checks for actions that would grant you panache in combat. This benefit ends when the exploration changes to a different scene (as determined by the GM) or shifts to an encounter or downtime.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Improved Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your ability to elude danger is matchless. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Keen Flair<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You inflict particularly devastating attacks on even well-defended foes. When you Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack with which you have master proficiency, if you roll a 19 on the die and the roll is a success, you critically succeed instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Eternal Confidence<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>As a swashbuckler at the peak of your skill, you swell with confidence and bravado in every attack. Your proficiency rank for your swashbuckler class DC increases to master.</p>\n<p>When you Strike as part of a finisher or Opportune Riposte, you can give the Strike the failure effect from the Confident Finisher action, including the increase from Precise Finisher if you have that feat. You can do so only if the Strike uses a weapon or unarmed attack that you could use for Confident Finisher.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Light Armor Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.</p>"
