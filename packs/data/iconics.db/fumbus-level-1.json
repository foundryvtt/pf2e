                    "value": "<p><em>The convoluted histories other people cling to don't interest goblins. These small folk live in the moment, and they prefer tall tales over factual records. The wars of a few decades ago might as well be from the ancient past. Misunderstood by other people, goblins are happy how they are. Goblin virtues are about being present, creative, and honest. They strive to lead fulfilled lives, rather than worrying about how their journeys will end. To tell stories, not nitpick the facts. To be small, but dream big.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Goblins have a reputation as simple creatures who love songs, fire, and eating disgusting things and who hate reading, dogs, and horses—and there are a great many for whom this description fits perfectly. However, great changes have come to goblinkind, and more and more goblins resist conformity to these stereotypes. Even among goblins that are more worldly, many still exemplify their old ways in some small manner, just to a more sensible degree. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire or fearlessly devour a meal that might turn others' stomachs. Others are endless tinkerers and view their companions' trash as the components of gadgets yet to be made.</p>\n<p>Though goblins' culture has splintered radically, their reputation has changed little. As such, goblins who travel to larger cities are frequently subjected to derision, and many work twice as hard at proving their worth.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is eccentric, enthusiastic, and fun-loving, you should play a goblin.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to prove that you have a place among other civilized peoples, perhaps even to yourself.</li>\n<li>Fight tooth and nail—sometimes literally—to protect yourself and your friends from danger.</li>\n<li>Lighten the heavy emotional burdens others carry (and amuse yourself) with antics and pranks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Work to ensure you don't accidentally (or intentionally) set too many things on fire.</li>\n<li>Assume you can't—or won't—read.</li>\n<li>Wonder how you survive given your ancestry's typical gastronomic choices, reckless behavior, and love of fire.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Goblins are stumpy humanoids with large bodies, scrawny limbs, and massively oversized heads with large ears and beady red eyes. Their skin ranges from green to gray to blue, and they often bear scars, boils, and rashes. Goblins average 3 feet tall. Most are bald, with little or no body hair. Their jagged teeth fall out and regrow constantly, and their fast metabolism means they eat constantly and nap frequently. Mutations are also more common among goblins than other peoples, and goblins usually view particularly salient mutations as a sign of power or fortune.</p>\n<p>Goblins reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood 4 or 5 years later. Goblins can live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Goblins tend to flock to strong leaders, forming small tribes. These tribes rarely number more than a hundred, though the larger a tribe is, the more diligent the leader must be to keep order—a notoriously difficult task. As new threats rise across the Inner Sea region, many tribal elders have put aside their reckless ways in the hope of forging alliances that offer their people a greater chance at survival. Play and creativity matter more to goblins than productivity or study, and their encampments erupt with songs and laughter.</p>\n<p>Goblins bond closely with their allies, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them or offered a sympathetic ear. Goblins tend to assume for their own protection that members of taller ancestries, which goblins often refer to colloquially as 'longshanks,' won't treat them kindly. Learning to trust longshanks is difficult for a goblin, and it's been only in recent years that such a partnership has even been an option. However, their attitude as a people is changing rapidly, and their short lifespans and poor memories help them adapt quickly.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Even well-intentioned goblins have trouble following the rules, meaning they're rarely lawful. Most goblin adventurers are chaotic neutral or chaotic good. Organized worship confounds goblins, and most of them would rather pick their own deities, choosing powerful monsters, natural wonders, or anything else they find fascinating. Longshanks might have books upon books about the structures of divinity, but to a goblin, anything can be a god if you want it to. Goblins who spend time around people of other ancestries might adopt some of their beliefs, though, and many goblin adventurers adopt the worship of Cayden Cailean.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>To some degree, almost every goblin is an adventurer, surviving life on the edge using skill and wits. Goblins explore and hunt for treasures by nature, though some become true adventurers in their own rights, often after being separated from their group or tribe.</p>\n<p>Goblins often have the acrobat, criminal, entertainer, gladiator, hunter, and street urchin backgrounds. Consider playing an alchemist, since many goblins love fire, or a bard, since many goblins love songs. As scrappy survivors, goblins are often rogues who dart about the shadows, though their inherently charismatic nature also draws them to the pursuit of magical classes such as sorcerer.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Goblins keep their names simple. A good name should be easy to pronounce, short enough to shout without getting winded, and taste good to say. The namer often picks a word that rhymes with something they like so that writing songs is easier. Since there aren't any real traditions regarding naming in goblin culture, children often name themselves once they're old enough to do something resembling talking.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Ak, Bokker, Frum, Guzmuk, Krobby, Loohi, Mazmord, Neeka, Omgot, Ranzak, Rickle, Tup, Wakla, Yonk, Zibini</p>"

You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use special infused reagents that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science.</p>\n<p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Alchemical Crafting]{Alchemical Crafting} feat, even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites, and you gain the four common 1st-level alchemical formulas granted by that feat. You can use this feat to create alchemical items as long as you have the items' formulas in your formula book.</p>\n<h3><strong>Infused Reagents</strong></h3>\n<p>You infuse reagents with your own alchemical essence, allowing you to create alchemical items at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you gain a number of batches of infused reagents equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use these reagents for either advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy, described below. Together, these infused reagents have light Bulk.</p>\n<p>As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your infused reagents from the previous day's preparations are instantly destroyed, and nonpermanent effects of your previous day's infused items immediately end. While infused reagents are physical objects, they can't be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than your daily preparations. Any such artificial reagents lack the infusion and are useless for advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy.</p>\n<h3><strong>Advanced Alchemy</strong></h3>\n<p>During your daily preparations, after producing new infused reagents, you can spend batches of those infused reagents to create infused alchemical items. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical reagent requirements. Your advanced alchemy level is equal to your level. For each batch of infused reagents you spend, choose an alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book, and make a batch of two of that item. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.</p>\n<h3><strong>Quick Alchemy</strong></h3>\n<p>If you need a specific alchemical item on the fly, you can use your infused reagents to quickly create it with the Quick Alchemy action.</p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Quick Alchemy]{Quick Alchemy}<span class=\"pf2-icon\">A</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Cost</strong> 1 batch of infused reagents</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Alchemist's Tools]{Alchemist's Tools}, the formula for the alchemical item you're creating, and a free hand.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You swiftly mix up a short-lived alchemical item to use at a moment's notice. You create a single alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book without having to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical reagents or needing to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3><strong>Formula Book</strong></h3>\n<p>An alchemist keeps meticulous records of the formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard formula book worth 10 sp or less for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to those you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to invent them with the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Inventor]{Inventor} feat.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>\n<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Research Field</h2>\n<p>Your inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe have led you to focus on a particular field of research. You might have a degree from an scientific institute, correspond with other researchers in your field, or work as a genius loner. Choose a field of research.</p>\n<p>Your research field adds a number of formulas to your formulas book; these are your signature items. When using a batch of infused reagents to create your signature items using advanced alchemy, you can create three items instead of two. Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature items with another formula in your formula book. This new signature item must be on your research field's list of possible signature items.</p>\n<p>Research fields can be found here (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Bomber]{Bomber}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Chirurgeon]{Chirurgeon}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Mutagenist]{Mutagenist} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Toxicologist]{Toxicologist}).</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Field Discovery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You learn a special discovery depending on your field.</p>\n<p>See specific research fields for more information.</p>\n<h2>Powerful Alchemy<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Alchemical items you create on the fly are particularily potent. When you use Quick Alchemy to create an infused alchemical item that allows a saving throw, you can change its DC to your class DC.</p>\n<h2>Alchemical Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've trained to more effectively wield the weapons you find in your lab. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, unarmed attacks, and alchemical bombs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Iron Will<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your mental defenses are an iron fortress. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Perpetual Infusions<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You have learned how to create perpetual alchemical infusions that can provide a near-infinite supply of certain simple items. You gain the ability to create two 1st-level alchemical items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.</p>\n<p>See specific research fields for more information.</p>\n<h2>Alchemical Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Constant practice has increased the effectiveness of your concoctions. Your proficiency rank for your alchemist class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Double Brew<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You know your formulas so well that you can concoct two items at once. When using the Quick Alchemy action, instead of spending one batch of infused reagents to create a single item, you can spend up to two batches of infused reagents to make up to two alchemical items as described in that action. These items do not have to be the same.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your body has become accustomed to physical hazards and resistant to pathogens and ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Perpetual Potency<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your perpetual infusions improve, allowing you to use Quick Alchemy to create more powerful items with no cost. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.</p>\n<p>See specific research fields for more information.</p>\n<h2>Greater Field Discovery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You learn an incredible discovery that advances your understanding of your field.</p>\n<p>See specific research fields for more information.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Alchemical Alacrity<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your comfort in concocting items is such that you can create three at a time. When using the Quick Alchemy action, you can spend up to three batches of infused reagents to make up to three alchemical items as described in that action. These items do not have to be the same.</p>\n<h2>Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Alchemical Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your alchemical concoctions are incredibly effective. Your proficiency rank for your alchemist class DC increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Perpetual Perfection<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You have perfected your perpetual infusions, allowing you to use Quick Alchemy to create even more powerful items at no cost.
