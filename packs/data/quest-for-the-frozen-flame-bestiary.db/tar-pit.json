A creature in the tar pit can attempt a @Check[type:athletics|dc:33] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Climb]{Climb} to either raise itself by one step (if it's submerged to its neck or full submerged) or to move 5 feet if it's submerged only up to its waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down one step. Other creatures can Aid the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid or by attempting to pull the creature out with their own @Check[type:athletics|dc:33] check, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check. In addition to the usual results, a character adjacent to the tar pit who critically fails while Aiding moves into the tar pit. A creature that Climbs out of the tar pit escapes the hazard and lands @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Prone]{Prone} in an adjacent space.</p>"
