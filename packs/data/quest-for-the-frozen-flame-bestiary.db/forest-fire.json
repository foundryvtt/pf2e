Dousing the flames automatically extinguishes one or more sections of fire, with no check. Water typically clears a 5‑foot square if the amount is small (such as from a spell like create water or hydraulic push). Larger amounts of water, such as a full bucket, typically douse a 10‑foot‑by‑10‑foot area (or 4 squares in some other shape). Throwing a bucket of water on flames requires an Interact action. A waterskin doesn't contain enough water to put out even 1 square of fire. Cold can also put out fire, but only if the cold can affect an area; cold is less effective than water, so a frost vial puts out only 1 square of fire, and a ray of frost is ineffective.</p>",
