It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Refocus] activity. You can Refocus by meditating to siphon power from the Shadow Plane and refill your focus pool. Your domain spells from the shadowcaster archetype are of the same tradition as the spells you used to meet the shadowcaster archetype's prerequisites.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.wHs6IGCMaXsgFNop]{Shadowcaster} archetype.</p>"
