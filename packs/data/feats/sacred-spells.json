Choose one of these two benefits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you're a prepared spellcaster, you can spend 10 minutes to replace one of the spells you've prepared with a spell of the same level from the list of sacred spells. You can do this while Refocusing.</li>\n<li>If you're a spontaneous spellcaster with the signature spells class feature, add two of the spells from the list of sacred spells to your repertoire.
