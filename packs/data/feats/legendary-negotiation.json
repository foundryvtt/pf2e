You attempt to Make an Impression and then Request your opponent cease their current activity and engage in negotiations. You take a -5 penalty to your Diplomacy check.

Some creatures might simply refuse, and even those who agree to parley might ultimately find your arguments lacking and return to violence.</p>"
