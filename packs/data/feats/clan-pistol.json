You get one clan pistol of your clan for free, as it was given to you at birth. This replaces your clan dagger. Selling this pistol is a terrible taboo and earns you the disdain of other dwarves. You are trained with the clan pistol. In addition, when your clan pistol is visible, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Gather Information] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Make an Impression] when interacting with citizens of Alkenstar, Dongun Hold, or their allies.</p>"
