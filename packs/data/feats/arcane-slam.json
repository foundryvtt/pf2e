Attempt an <span data-pf2-action=\"arcaneSlam\" data-pf2-glyph=\"D\">Athletics</span> check against the foe's Fortitude DC. You take a -2 circumstance penalty to your check if the target is one size larger than you and a -4 circumstance penalty if it's larger than that. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check if the target is one size smaller than you and a +4 circumstance bonus if it's smaller than that.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You slam the foe down and the magical energy overwhelms it. The creature is knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone], becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] for 1 round, and takes damage equal to [[/r (2d6+@actor.system.abilities.str.mod)]]{2d6 plus your Strength modifier}. The foe is no longer grabbed or restrained by you.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You slam the foe down. The creature is knocked prone and takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. The foe is no longer grabbed or restrained by you.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You are unable to slam the creature, but your hold on the creature remains.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature breaks free and is no longer grabbed or restrained by you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Enhancement</strong> Your arms better channel your core's power. You no longer take penalties for attempting to slam larger foes. Your foe takes damage equal to 2d6 plus your Strength modifier on a success (or double that on a critical success).</p>"
