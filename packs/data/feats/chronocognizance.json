You're automatically aware if any creature that you observe is under the effects of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Quickened] conditions. You have a general idea when you're in the vicinity of time-manipulating phenomena, though this grants you no particular insight into the specific effects of the anomaly. Particularly subtle temporal anomalies might still escape your notice, requiring a Perception check, as determined by the GM. If you're legendary in Arcana, Nature, or Occultism, or Religion, whenever a creature that you can observe gains the benefits of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Time Stop]</em> or similar effects, you can observe what happens during the stopped time, though you still can't act yourself for the duration.</p>"
