You scoff and verbally refute the triggering effect, attempting a counteract check using your Intimidation modifier with a counteract level of half your level rounded up. If you succeed, you ignore the triggering effect, though any other creatures that were also targeted or in the area are still affected. If the source of the effect you successfully counteracted understands your language and has an Intelligence modifier of -3 or higher, that creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied] for 1 round.</p>"
