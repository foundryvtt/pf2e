If you're at least an expert in a repeating hand crossbow you're using, you gain access to its critical specialization effect. You can perform the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.Shootist's Draw] action with repeating hand crossbows.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> If you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Running Reload] feat, you can reload a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Repeating Hand Crossbow Magazine] on the move. You can use Running Reload as a 3-action activity to reload a magazine into a repeating hand crossbow after you Stride, Step, or Sneak, or as a 2-action activity if you use a magazine from a shootist bandolier.</p>"
