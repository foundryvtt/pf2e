You command your mount to Stride up to its Speed (or to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Burrow], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Climb], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Fly], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Swim], if it has the corresponding movement type), moving through the spaces of any foes in your path up to one size smaller than your mount.</p>\n<p>Your mount deals damage equal to the melee Strike using its legs to each creature whose space you move through, subject to a basic Reflex save against your mount's Athletics DC. On a critical failure, the creature also becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Flat-Footed] until the end of your next turn. You can damage a given creature only once during this movement.</p>"
