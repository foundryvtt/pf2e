If you're a master in Performance, you can choose up to four targets, and if you're legendary, you can choose any number of targets. If you succeed, any attempt made by you to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Demoralize] that creature within the next 24 hours gains a +1 circumstance bonus. If your Charisma score is 20 or higher and you're a master in Performance, this bonus increases to +2. Once a creature is boasted at in this manner, it becomes temporarily immune to further Triumphant Boasts for 24 hours.</p>"
