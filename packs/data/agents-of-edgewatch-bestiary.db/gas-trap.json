If a creature acts before the trap on the first round, it has the option of holding its breath to postpone taking damage from the trap-holding one's breath after the trap's first action has no effect, since the air in the creature's lungs is already tainted. Locating and blocking one of the hidden gas vents reduces the poison damage by 1d6-if all four are blocked, the trap is disabled, though the door remains locked. Otherwise, the trap functions for 1 minute before all the gas is expended and characters in the room cease taking damage, after which the trap ventilates the room for 1 additional minute.</p>"
