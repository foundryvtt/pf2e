On a failure or critical failure, the creature is also encased in hot wax. A creature that starts its turn encased in wax takes 8d12 fire damage and is immobilized until it Escapes the hardening wax (DC 35). Each turn it remains encased, the damage dealt by the hot wax decreases by 2d12 but the DC to Escape increases by 2 (minimum 0 damage, maximum DC 43).
