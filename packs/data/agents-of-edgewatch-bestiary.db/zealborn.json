                    "value": "<p>You enforce a magic rule on a willing target, forcing it to either perform or refrain from carrying out a certain act. A <em>geas</em> to perform an act is usually conditional, such as, \"Always offer hospitality to strangers seeking a place to stay.\" An unconditional <em>geas</em> to perform a certain act doesn't require the target to perform that act exclusively, though it must prioritize the task above all leisurely pursuits. The most common <em>geas</em> to refrain from carrying out an act is a specification to avoid violating a contract. In those cases, the secondary caster usually takes charge of making sure the wording of the contract is attuned correctly with the ritual's magic. Because the target is willing, <em>geas</em> can have a duration that lasts for as long as the target agrees to. If the target is unable to fulfill the <em>geas</em>, it becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened 1}, and the sickened condition increases by 1 for each consecutive day it is prevented from following the <em>geas</em>, to a maximum of sickened 4. The sickened condition ends immediately when it follows the <em>geas</em> again; it can't remove the sickened condition in any other way. Only powerful magic such as a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Wish]{Wish}</em> spell can remove the effects of <em>geas</em> from a willing target.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The<em>geas</em>succeeds, and the target receives a +1 status bonus to skill checks that directly uphold the<em>geas</em>(at the GM's discretion).</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The<em>geas</em>succeeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The<em>geas</em>fails.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The<em>geas</em>fails, and you are instead affected by the<em>geas</em>you were attempting to place on the target. You are considered an unwilling target, so the<em>geas</em>can be counteracted with a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Remove Curse]{Remove Curse}</em> spell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> You can use <em>geas</em> on an unwilling creature; it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. If the target fails this Will save, the <em>geas</em> lasts up to 1 week. A <em>remove curse</em> spell can counteract a <em>geas</em> on an unwilling creature, in addition to powerful magic such as a <em>wish</em> spell. A clever unwilling creature can subvert the <em>geas</em> by contriving situations that prevent it from complying, but in that case it becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened} (as described above).</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> As 5th level, but the <em>geas</em> lasts for up to 1 year on an unwilling creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> As 5th level, but the <em>geas</em> lasts for a duration you choose (even unlimited) on an unwilling creature.</p>"

If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.</p>\n<p>In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC - 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster-for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage-the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any further damage from it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage of the image's Strikes increases by 1d4, and the maximum size of creature you can create increases by one (to a maximum of Gargantuan).</p>"
