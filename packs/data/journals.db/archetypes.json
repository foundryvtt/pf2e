Or in a pinch, with trebuchets, siege towers, catapults, hwachas, and all other lethal miscellanea of a combat engineers' corp. As a true artillerist, you leave the penny-ante pistols and knives to those who only need to operate on a small scale. You're a consummate professional in the art of big guns, a maestro at merging mathematics and manpower to transform whatever castle wall, infantry battalion, or rampaging dragon offends you into a smoking crater in the ground.</p><p>You're not just some daredevil demolitionist, though. You're part of a team, accustomed to coordinating with your unit to maximize your time and effectiveness. Whether jumping in to help your crew load the next round, quickly calculating the trajectory of the engine's next shot, or taking the shot yourself, your presence on the team ensures their chances of success are maximized, creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p><section class=\"info\"><h4>Leading with a Cannon</h4><p>A proper artillerist is more than an engineer, though their skills in that field certainly shouldn't be underestimated. When a war becomes unavoidable, the presence of knights and pikemen might decide a skirmish or battle, but a well-trained artillerist with a reliable squad and a few good siege weapons can make the difference between prolonged months of battle with countless lives lost and a shorter, less bloody affair with fewer deaths and a more lasting victory.</p><p>Castles and fortifications are critical tools for holding land in a world full of empires, kingdoms, and duchies all vying for power. Many wars are won or lost not based on the military might of either side, but on a castle's ability to withstand an extended siege. Without a team of engineers capable of penetrating a castle or keep's defenses, the occupants can wait out an invading force for as long as they have enough food and water to keep their citizens and defenders healthy and fed. Many wars have been “won” when the besieged force manages to last through a single winter. Besieging armies whose supply lines break down due to snow-clogged passes or insufficient cold weather gear are forced to retreat due to losses from poor hygiene or hypothermia long before attrition has had an opportunity to impact their opponents.</p><p>An artillerist changes this dynamic, completely rewriting the rules of war. Rather than time being on the side of the besieged, it becomes the tool of the besieger. Each day that passes while a skilled artillerist hammers the castle walls with cannon fire and catapult stones brings the fortifications ever closer to crumbling down. Some wise nobles and warlords who realize their opponents have brought siege weapons, especially powerful black powder siege weapons like cannons, will choose to negotiate surrender before battle is even started, recognizing an inevitable defeat that can be staved off temporarily by sacrificing many soldiers but not thwarted without outside intervention.</p><p>Ruthless or evil artillerists, or the warlords they follow, might take things a step further, specifically targeting granaries to starve enemies out or launching rotting food, corpses, or diseased livestock into parts of the town near water sources. As food and water supplies dwindle, so too does the morale of the castle's inhabitants and defenders. Even a stubborn noble or warlord will find it hard to continue resisting a siege when their own troops mutiny and their citizens begin seeking a way out.</p></section><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Artillerist Dedication]{Artillerist Dedication} Feat 2</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in martial weapons</p><hr /><p>Artillery is a team sport, where every member of the crew has to rely on the other members. At best, a mistake might just waste time. At worst, a misaligned fuse or a badly set pin could cause the whole thing to explode. You've taken these lessons to heart, and so your presence on an artillery team assists the entire team at every aspect of the siege weapon's deployment and usage. If you're serving on a siege weapon crew, you and all other members gain a +2 circumstance bonus to any checks to Load, Aim, move, or Repair the weapon. When you Aim a siege weapon, you can move the weapon's aim twice as far as normal.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained at least two other feats from the artillerist archetype.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Named Artillery]{Named Artillery} Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Crafting</p><hr /><p>It is a tradition among artillerists to name the siege weapon most important to them and closest to their heart—much as a sailor on a ship, the weapon is their livelihood. You've gone a step further, and you always make sure that your named artillery has the best possible maintenance and upkeep. You can spend a full day adjusting and working on a single siege weapon to designate it as your named artillery. The siege weapon you designated as your named artillery gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, Fortitude saves, and Reflex saves as well as additional Hit Points equal to twice your level.</p><p>During your daily preparations, you must spend at least one hour on maintenance to service your named artillery. If you fail to do so, or if you spend a full day designating a new piece of named artillery, the previous named artillery loses any benefits from this feat. Only one artillerist can designate a particular siege weapon as their named artillery, even if several artillerists are serving on the same siege weapon's crew (though it's typically more efficient for a group with several artillerists to divide them up, assigning one to each siege weapon).</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Shorthanded]{Shorthanded} Feat 4</h2><hr /><p>Typically, a siege weapon is meant to be run by a crew with a very specific minimum number of members designed to ensure that your crew can account for every possible variable and necessity in loading, aiming, and firing the weapon. In a pinch, however, you can operate it with fewer people, provided you know what you're doing. You can operate a siege weapon with fewer than the minimum number of crew, at an increasing penalty. You and your crew take a -2 penalty to checks to Load, Aim, Launch, move, or Repair the weapon for each person below the minimum crew. The maximum number of missing minimum crew members you can handle with this feat is 5. For example, if a siege weapon had a minimum crew size of 8, you would still need a crew of 3, and you would take a -10 penalty when doing so.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Cannon Corner Shot]{Cannon Corner Shot} Feat 6</h2><hr /><p>By loading special ammunition in a particular way, you can make your siege weapons do all manner of tricks that other siege engineers can barely even imagine. If you personally contribute an additional Load action to the siege weapon's loading, above the minimum, you can change a burst into a line twice as long as the size of the burst, or vice versa (so a 10-foot burst turns into a 20-foot line, or a 20-foot line turns into a 10-foot burst).</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Field Artillery]{Field Artillery} Feat 6</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Crafting</p><hr /><p>While castles are generally obliging enough to stay in one place, out in the field positioning is of paramount importance—a gun in the wrong place is worse than useless. You can Interact with an adjacent mounted siege weapon to increase its Speed by 10 feet for one round.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Live Ammunition]{Live Ammunition} Feat 8</h2><hr /><p>There are generally few things as ill-advised as being shot out of a cannon or launched by a trebuchet, but people use the tactic every so often in a desperate situation. While it's more humane to use this strategy with mindless constructs or undead, occasionally an exceedingly foolhardy adventurer demands the opportunity to try it. Loading a creature requires two additional Load actions, which you must conduct personally. The creature must be willing, unconscious, or restrained throughout the process, and the siege weapon must be physically capable of firing the creature in question, based on their size and shape. Typically, that means ballistas don't qualify, for example—nor do auto-catapults which require specifically-sized balls—but normal catapults and onagers work just fine. When you Launch the weapon, if the weapon usually targets an area, you target a single 5-foot square instead. The siege weapon deals its normal damage to its target, or to the modified area, and to the creature fired.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Master Siege Engineer]{Master Siege Engineer} Feat 16</h2><hr /><p>What you don't know about artillery isn't worth knowing and your mastery allows you to perform an impossible number of actions as part of a siege weapon's crew. You're permanently quickened. You can only use the extra action to Aim or Launch a siege weapon.</p>",

                "content": "<p><strong>Rarity</strong> uncommon</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The art of creating the weapons most commonly referred to as “beast guns” is truly ancient, with the first iterations of the weapons created on the continent of Arcadia well over 10,000 years ago. This means that beast guns predate all other forms of firearm crafting in Arcadia, even the legendary star guns, whose secrets have been lost to the ages. The tradition of designing beast guns has persisted throughout Arcadia well into the modern era, though it has become increasingly rare as the proliferation of classic firearms and the prestige associated with star guns has allowed more people access to equivalent destructive power without the intense requirements behind crafting a beast gun. However, beast gunners remain virtually unknown outside of Arcadia.</p>\n<p>The art of bonding to a beast gun and gaining the full magic of a beast gunner is an extended ritual with multiple steps, beginning with the hunt. A person seeking to bond to a beast gun typically does so with a brand new weapon made after they hunt down the creature themselves. This involves telling the story of the hunt, the beast, and the weapon created from the hunted creature. Finally, the weapon is carefully modified and tailored to ensure a proper bond between the beast gun and the prospective beast gunner. However, it's also possible to bond to an heirloom beast gun passed down through the generations by adding symbolic fresh components from the same kind of creature, after performing the same ritual hunt necessary to forge a new weapon with the intent of establishing a bond.</p>\n<p>To perform the ritual the prospective beast gunner must first plan a hunt to slay the creature corresponding to the beast gun, whether they wish to bond with a brand new beast gun or establish a link to an old beast gun. Typically, these ritualized hunts can include up to five assistants plus hunting beasts like canines or birds who help corner the beast and bring it down. If the assistants are significantly more powerful than the hunted creature, or if there are so many assistants the creature never stood a chance at survival, the magic simply fails during the bonding process and the hunt and organic materials are wasted, usually much to the shame and chagrin of the hunter. The same doesn't apply if the prospective beast gunner hunts the creature alone, even if they are significantly more powerful than the creature, such that the creature never stood a chance against them in a one on one fight.</p>\n<p>You're one of those who successfully completed the hunt and bonded with your prized weapon. Now, you seek to discover the hidden depths that others who think they know how to use beast guns can only imagine.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Choosing Your Beast Gun</h4>\n<p>A beast gunner's bond with their beast gun is deep and mystical, so if you hope to be a successful beast gunner, it's important to choose a beast gun that suits your temperament, magic, and combat style. For example, if you favor strength and intimidation, a screech shooter is the right choice for you, whereas a spider gun might be optimal if you prefer a more careful style of setting up the battlefield in advance. Similarly, a tentacle cannon is slow and methodical and can hold an enemy in place at close range, while a drake rifle is energetic and mobile and can be used to attack from a great distance. Each beast gun has a personality and magical abilities that attract people who value them. For this reason, some experienced beast gunners say the weapon chooses you.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Beast Gunner Dedication]{Beast Gunner Dedication} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert with at least one type of firearm, you own a beast gun and have slain the type of creature associated with your beast gun in a fair hunt (see above); trained in Arcana and Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've bonded to your beast gun and unlocked the first hints of its hidden potential.

Your mount deals damage equal to the melee Strike using its legs to each creature whose space you move through, subject to a basic Reflex save against your mount's Athletics DC. On a critical failure, the creature also becomes flat-footed until the end of your next turn.

The awe-inspiring presence of these creatures makes them worthy of reverence-or even outright worship. Dragon disciples dedicate themselves to becoming like these great beasts, with each disciple striving to typify one variety of dragon. Sorcerers of draconic blood, barbarians with the dragon instinct, and many kobolds with close ties to their draconic predecessors become dragon disciples, but anyone who has encountered one of these terrifying creatures might follow this path.</p>\n<p>As a dragon disciple, you study and learn from the example of dragons, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you admire the dragons you emulate.

Any dragon disciple can find the attitudes of dragonkind intruding into their thoughts. The foremost emotion among all types of dragons is pride.

When tempered, this feeling levels out to a steady confidence, but when uncontrolled, it can grow to an air of arrogance or superiority.</p>\n<p>Disciples of metallic dragons also feel the pangs of compassion and benevolence. They grow to be more focused on cooperation and might take on leadership roles. Disciples of the vile chromatic dragons are plagued by thoughts of cruelty and greed. They long to see fear in the eyes of foe and friend alike. Those who succumb to these thoughts become bullies or tyrants.</p>\n<p>Instinctual draconic feelings can be constant, yet they seem to intensify when the disciple uses their draconic powers. In the few seconds after using a breath weapon or attacking with claws, or when the disciple sprouts wings, they might have a moment of mental transformation.

Each time you do, select three additional types of ammunition as described above.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Precious Arrow]{Precious Arrow} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Eldritch Archer Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You enchant a piece of ammunition with the magical essence of a precious material, allowing you to leverage certain creatures' weaknesses. Choose cold iron or silver; if you shoot the arrow before the end of your turn, it counts as that material. At 14th level, add adamantine to the list of materials you can choose from.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Expert Eldritch Archer Spellcasting]{Expert Eldritch Archer Spellcasting} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Basic Eldritch Archer Spellcasting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You gain the expert spellcasting benefits.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Seeker Arrow]{Seeker Arrow} Feat 14</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Eldritch Archer Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your shots zip around corners and fly at impossible angles to reach your target.

Make a bow Strike against a foe who is observed or hidden to you (but not undetected). The ammunition travels to your target in a straight line, passing through any non-magical barriers or walls in its way, though magical barriers stop the arrow. The shot ignores all cover, the concealed condition, the hidden condition, and circumstance bonuses to AC from shields. It has a +4 status bonus to hit creatures wearing any type of armor. The Strike's damage can't be reduced with a Shield Block reaction using a non-magical shield.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Arrow of Death]{Arrow of Death} Feat 18</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Eldritch Archer Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> Once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You modify an arrow or bolt to bring death to your target in a single potent hit.

You connect disparate facts to unlock deeper mysteries and uncover the truths of the universe, and you zealously hoard the knowledge your painstaking research produces. Aberrations fascinate you for many reasons, not the least of which is because their anatomy is wholly alien and yet, to the insightful, eminently sensible.</p>\n<p>You've been particularly enlightened by the accumulated lore in <em>Thresholds of Truth</em>, and you know Zarmavdian was a kindred soul in occult research. With this book in hand, you feel like you stand at the doorway to unprecedented occult discoveries.

You gain the cleric's Domain Initiate feat but must select knowledge, secrecy, or truth as your domain. You cast that domain's domain spell as a focus spell of the same tradition as your cantrip from Eldritch Researcher Dedication, and you Refocus by contemplating abstruse mysteries rather than praying to a god. When an ability would manifest a divine symbol-such as the word of truth focus spell-it instead manifests as a strange shape unique to you that seems to defy geometry.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can take this feat up to three times, selecting a different domain each time.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Strange Script]{Strange Script} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Eldritch Researcher Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have such familiarity with obscure texts that you can compel them to reveal their secrets.

You gain an advanced domain spell from one domain you selected with Seeker of Truths.

Once per day as an occult innate spell, you can cast daydreamer's curse , outcast's curse, or savant's curse. At the GM's discretion, you can substitute or add additional occult curse spells of 4th level or lower to this list. You can choose a different spell from the list each time you use this ability. If you couldn't already cast occult spells, these spells use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability, and you become trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells; if you could already cast occult spells, your proficiency in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Entities From Afar]{Entities From Afar} Feat 14</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Eldritch Researcher Dedication</p>\n<p>You can call in aberrations to fight for you or to answer questions.

For the creature to effectively answer, you must Sustain the Spell for 1 minute, and you must understand and be understood by the aberration. If you do, the aberration gives you a cryptic clue as provided by the read omens spell, except that the clue is even more enigmatic than normal; the creature then immediately returns from whence it came without providing you any other benefit. At 16th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the summon entity spell is heightened by 1 level (to a maximum of 8th level when you reach 20th level).</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Incredible Recollection]{Incredible Recollection} <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Feat 14</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Eldritch Researcher Dedication</p>\n<p>You can sift through knowledge locked within your mind at an incredible pace.

                "content": "<p>You pacify restless spirits, ghosts, and haunts, capturing fragments of them and using their vengeful energies to fuel your own powers while purifying the spirit. You store these ghosts within a magical vessel called a spirit dwelling. This spirit dwelling might be a treasured family heirloom, an item you crafted expressly to help with exorcisms, or even just an odd trinket you found that happens to do the job.</p>\n<p>While the motivations of exorcists run the gamut, most are compassionate individuals who believe that every ghost, haunt, and spirit is simply a lost soul in need of rest. They collect spirits expressly for the purposes of offering them comfort, guidance, and absolution. After an exorcist's ministrations, these spirits are freed of their burdens, emotion, and regrets and are reabsorbed into the River of Souls. Although exorcists rarely gather in one place, many different religions employ them to deal with spiritual threats.</p>\n<p>Exorcists are most commonly found among the faithful of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Ashava]{Ashava} the True Spark (the empyreal lord of dancers), but among the major deities of the Inner Sea region, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Sarenrae]{Sarenrae}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Pharasma]{Pharasma}, and even @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Shelyn]{Shelyn} count a fair number of exorcists among their faithful. Exorcists can come from any walk of life, but many are redeemer champions, clerics, or monks. Apart from the role of the spirit dwelling, exorcism practices can vary. For example, a bard or rogue might attract spirits with trickery, charm, or empty promises. In contrast, a cleric of Pharasma could take a more severe route, demanding the spirits return to the natural order of things.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats:</strong> 8th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spiritual Sense]{Spiritual Sense}; 10th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Blind-Fight]{Blind-Fight}; 14th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Sense Evil]{Sense Evil}; 16th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Sense The Unseen]{Sense The Unseen}</p>\n<section class=\"info\">SPIRIT DWELLINGS AND REMNANTS\n<p>A spirit dwelling can be any object, from an everyday item like a mirror, hand bell, or gemstone, to a custom clockwork device, so long as it can be held in one hand, is light Bulk, and doesn't serve another function (such as a weapon, shield, consumable, or magic item). Your spirit dwelling has the trait of the magical tradition used to take Exorcist Dedication and the necromancy trait. Your spirit dwelling is attuned to you, so only you can use it. If your spirit dwelling is lost or stolen, you can turn another object into a new spirit dwelling with a 1-hour ritual; this causes your previous spirit dwelling to revert to a mundane object and any spirits within to harmlessly disperse.</p>\n<p>Your spirit dwelling can house not just wisps but greater remnants of spiritual energy left behind by defeated ghosts and haunts. You can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Collect Spirit Remnant]{Collect Spirit Remnant} activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Rejuvenating Spirits</strong>: Though all spirit wisps and most remnants can pass on immediately when purified, if a spirit remnant came from a creature with the rejuvenation special ability (such as most ghosts), a recurring haunt, or another entity who ordinarily doesn't pass on when destroyed, its ties to this world are too strong for it to easily pass on. When a spirit remnant from such an entity is released as part of your daily preparations, instead of joining the River of Souls, it begins re-forming itself in the time and location noted in its rejuvenation ability. However, you learn a clue about the spirit's unfinished business, which may help you put it to rest permanently.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"info\">EXORCISTS ACROSS GOLARION\n<p>The well-known exorcists of Pharasma use methods of repeated prayer, holy water, and sacred rituals. Ashavic exorcists often dance under the moonlight to entice lost souls and guide them onward. In Osirion, exorcists practice execration, or proactive preventive exorcism techniques. In Northern Garund and some parts of Qadira, playing the stringed tanbura, rattling manjur, and specific drum patterns help cut the threads that tie the spirit to this world. Matanji orcs in the Mwangi Expanse perform exorcisms by drawing tattoo-like diagrams in iron ink. In Tian Xia, exorcists often use fulus (Secrets of Magic 158) to assist in their practice.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Exorcist Dedication]{Exorcist Dedication} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Occultism or Religion</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned to attract, quell, and purify spirits, housing them in a special receptacle called a spirit dwelling until they're ready to move on. Through the power of prayers or ritual incantations, one mundane object in your possession becomes a spirit dwelling (page 23). Your spirit dwelling functions as a lure for lost spirits weakened by their time on the Material Plane. Each day during your daily preparations, your spirit dwelling attracts a spirit wisp who comes to dwell inside. If your spirit dwelling contains no wisps, you can spend 10 minutes in a minor ritual to cast your spirit dwelling around an area and attract another wisp. You can also capture stronger spirit remnants from vanquished undead spirits, as explained in the sidebar on page 23. As long as your spirit dwelling contains any spirits, it glows faintly, casting dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p>\n<p>As an exorcist, you do more than just collect spirits: you also help rid them of their burdens and lingering resentments, aiding their transition from the Material Plane. Every day, before your daily preparations, any spirit wisps and remnants remaining within your spirit dwelling from the previous day are purified and can join the River of Souls in their final journey to Pharasma's Boneyard.</p>\n<p>You can also learn abilities that let you purify a spirit in your spirit dwelling immediately in a cathartic surge, granting you a helpful effect as they depart for the afterlife. Any actions you gain from the exorcist archetype gain either the divine or occult trait, depending on whether you used Occultism or Religion to qualify for Exorcist Dedication. <span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Spirit's Mercy]{Spirit's Mercy} is the simplest of the purifications.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the exorcist archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Cast Out]{Cast Out} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Exorcist Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You attempt to cast a malevolent entity out of the creature or object it's possessing. Roll a counteract check against the possession effect; you must be within 30 feet of the possessed creature or object to do so. Your counteract level is half your level rounded up, and your counteract modifier is your Occultism modifier, Religion modifier, or spell DC - 10, whichever is highest. If you succeed, the entity is driven out and can't attempt to possess that creature or object for 1 week. If you fail, the possessing creature is immune to your Cast Out for a year and a day.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spirit's Absolution]{Spirit's Absolution} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Exorcist Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Cost</strong> 1 spirit wisp or spirit remnant from your spirit dwelling</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are holding your spirit dwelling.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You purify a spirit by absolving it of its sins and regrets. This cathartic experience restores your Hit Points or those of an adjacent ally. If you expend a spirit wisp, the target recovers 1d4 Hit Points per level you have.

This deals sonic damage to all creatures in a @Template[type:cone|distance:30], with a basic Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If you expend a spirit wisp, this deals [[/r 1d4[sonic]]] damage per level you have.

                "content": "<p>Your ties to the living world cling to you in death, your unfinished business reducing you to a spirit. Your soul carries on, but your body is gone. Your mind, too, may have changed: though death can impact thoughts and desires in all sorts of ways, most ghosts experience stronger, more volatile emotions and are frequently overcome by their past ties. A need to reconcile the past overwhelms other needs. Motivations can change over time but are always strong. Pragmatism, compassion, and foresight fall before a ghost's fundamental desires.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:left\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Ghost Dedication]{Ghost Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> You died and returned as a ghost.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have risen as a shell of your former self, a spirit of mist and anguish. You gain the ghost, spirit, and undead traits, and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Basic Undead Benefits]{Basic Undead Benefits}. Your undead craving is to settle your unfinished business. You also gain the incorporeal trait, as described on page 218, except you can't pass through solid objects unless you select the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Pass Through]{Pass Through} feat. Being a ghost has the following major effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Floating</strong> You can float but are still tethered to the ground. Replace your land Speed with an equal fly Speed. You can't rise more than a few inches above the ground when you Fly. This means you can move above many types of difficult or hazardous terrain without moving slowly or being damaged, even though you can't fly without limit. You can Leap, High Jump, Long Jump, and take similar actions, and use your fly Speed for any calculations that would normally require your land Speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Items</strong> You can transmute physical items to make them part of your incorporeal form. This requires spending 10 minutes with the items within reach, during which you transform the items into part of your form; you can return items you already have incorporated to a corporeal state at the same time. The items retain all their runes and other abilities, need to be invested normally if they have the invested trait, and need to be worn, held, or stowed appropriately. Once you've incorporated the items, you and other incorporeal creatures can use them normally—you can Interact with them, Release them, and so on. Your incorporated weapons gain the benefits of the ghost touch property rune, allowing you to use them normally against both corporeal and incorporeal creatures. Incorporated items become corporeal again only if you transmute them back or are destroyed, in which case, they drop to the ground under you.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks</strong> Your unarmed attacks become magical and deal negative damage instead of their normal type.</p>\n<p><strong>Strength</strong> Unlike most incorporeal creatures, your Strength modifier is not -5; you keep the same Strength score you had before you became a ghost, though you can only attempt Strength-based skill checks—typically Athletics checks—against other incorporeal creatures, as normal for an incorporeal creature. Against incorporeal creatures, use your Strength normally to determine the results of Athletics checks, Strikes with melee weapons, and any other checks or damage rolls dependent on Strength.</p>\n<p><strong>Ties that Bind</strong> When you become a ghost, work with your GM to choose a bound site and unfinished business, both of which matter for your character's story, as well as some ghost archetype feats. Your bound site tethers you to the physical world and is typically either a location important to you in life or the place where you died. Unfinished business keeps you from passing to the afterlife. If someone resolves your unfinished business, you decide whether to accept the change and pass on, or to fight it. If you pass on, you get a few minutes to say your goodbyes, and then move into the River of Souls and the afterlife. Your character ceases to be. If you fight the change, you remain, though you and the GM might determine a new unfinished business. If you are physically destroyed, you cease your existence as a ghost but still might not be able to pass on to the afterlife if your unfinished business is incomplete. In this liminal state, you might come across strange energies and become another sort of creature, or anchor to a summoner and become an eidolon.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Frightful Moan]{Frightful Moan} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> Once per 10 minutes</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You lament your fate, forcing each living creature in a 30-foot emanation to attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune to Frightful Moans for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is frightened 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is frightened 2.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Ghostly Resistance]{Ghostly Resistance} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your ghostly form becomes innately weaker but also gains resistance to many forms of damage. Your maximum HP is reduced by your level. You gain resistance 1 to all damage except for force, positive, and any damage done by a weapon with the ghost touch rune (or any other source that acts like a ghost touch rune). This resistance increases to 2 if the source is non-magical. At 10th level, the resistance increases to 2, or 4 if the source is non-magical. At 16th level, the resistance increases to 3, or 5 if the source is non-magical.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Ghostly Grasp]{Ghostly Grasp} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your control over your ghostly form grows. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Advanced Undead Benefits]{Advanced Undead Benefits} and can interact with physical objects, with limits. You can attempt Strength-based skill checks against physical creatures and objects. You can Interact with physical objects, but the action has no effect unless you succeed at a DC 20 Athletics or DC 20 Thievery check.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Ghost Flight]{Ghost Flight} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> Once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can suppress your tether to the ground, overcoming your resistance to fly free. For 10 minutes, your fly Speed doesn't restrict you to only a few inches off the ground, allowing you to travel to any height you choose.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Pass Through]{Pass Through} Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in Acrobatics, Ghost Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> Once per 10 minutes</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Filtering your form through the substance of an object, you can pass through walls, doors, and more. You Fly up to your Speed. During this movement, you can try to move through one object. Attempt an Acrobatics check as you try to enter its space. The DC is typically 30 to move through a wall of up to 5 feet, 15 for an ordinary door, and 10 for thinner structures like windows; the GM might set the DC higher for especially dense materials like adamantine or lead, or for barriers that are magically reinforced. You can't Pass Through an obstacle made of magical force, such as a wall of force.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You move through the object, treating the square within it as difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside an object, you can move out of it only if you Pass Through again or use some other means of moving through a solid object. As normal for being incorporeal, starting your turn inside an object makes you slowed 1 for that turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you moved out of the square you started in.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Rejuvenation]{Rejuvenation} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The call of your unfinished business recreates you after destruction. When you're destroyed, you reform after 2d4 days within your bound site, fully healed. If your unfinished business is resolved while you're waiting, you pass on immediately unless you and the GM determine you have new unfinished business.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Unlimited Ghost Flight]{Unlimited Ghost Flight} Feat 14</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Flight</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You put your connection to the material world farther behind you. Your fly Speed no longer restricts the height you can fly. When you use Ghost Flight, instead of its normal effect, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your fly Speed for 10 minutes.</p>",

A rogue might go from finding clever ways to pick pockets to finding ways to waylay opponents and devour them.</p>\n<p>Since most societies don't allow cannibalism, ghouls who wish to continue their old lives must satisfy their cravings in secret, finding a way to balance society's rules while feeding the constant gnawing hunger inside them. Some take up professions that allow them to secretly eat dead flesh or create dead bodies to feed upon. There are tales told of ghoul mercenary troops who satisfy their cravings and profit, while ghoul spellcasters can use their magic to procure and preserve flesh.</p>\n<p>Ghouls who won't restrain themselves with rules of the living may join or establish ghoul societies. These caste systems base their hierarchy on how much flesh one has consumed and can provide for other ghouls. Hunger and ambition drive ghouls to rise through the ranks, which allows them to feed their hunger even more.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats</strong>: 6th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Guarded Movement]{Guarded Movement}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Reactive Pursuit]{Reactive Pursuit}; 10th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Wall Run]{Wall Run}</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:left\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Ghoul Dedication]{Ghoul Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> You were killed by ghoul fever.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have succumbed to ghoul fever, dying and returning as a ghoul, an undead cursed with a never-ending hunger for dead flesh that slowly overrides your reason and willpower until you would do anything for the meal you crave. In addition to the personality changes, your body changes as well. Your ears become pointed, and your skin grows blueish and pale. Your fingernails sharpen into claws; your teeth become razor sharp, ready to tear flesh off the bone; and your tongue grows long and pointed.</p>\n<p>You gain the ghoul and undead traits and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Basic Undead Benefits]{Basic Undead Benefits}. Your undead craving is for the flesh of dead creatures; freshly dead corpses from sapient creatures fulfill your cravings much more than non-sapient or rotted corpses, but any dead creature can stave off the hunger for at least a little while. You gain two unarmed attacks in the brawling weapon group. The first unarmed attack is a claw that deals 1d4 slashing damage with the agile and finesse traits, and the second unarmed attack is a set of jaws that deal 1d6 piercing damage and have the finesse trait.</p>\n<p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Consume Flesh]{Consume Flesh}. Satisfying your craving is difficult. Consuming Flesh temporarily satiates you. Many ghoul feats have extra abilities or functions that can be used when you are satiated, though using those abilities also causes you to lose your satiated status. You can always Consume Flesh, but eating more than a normal amount has no further effect; a ghoul's hunger is satiated, or it is not.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Replenishing Consumption]{Replenishing Consumption} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you devour corpses and satiate your hunger, you also recover from some of your wounds, your necrotized blue flesh knitting back together almost immediately as soon as you begin shoveling the chunks of dead flesh down your throat. Once every 10 minutes, when you Consume Flesh, you regain 1d6 Hit Points for every 2 levels you have, rounded up.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Swift Leap]{Swift Leap} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> GhoulDedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your undead physiology allows you to leap quickly toward or away from your opponent. You Leap. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.</p>\n<p>If you are satiated, you can choose to end your satiation to instead @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.High Jump]{High Jump} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Long Jump]{Long Jump} without triggering reactions, as you take a quick, enormous jump before any foe can react to your movement.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Feverish Enzymes]{Feverish Enzymes} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your claws and fangs exude an infectious enzyme, related to the necrotic effects of ghoul fever, that causes a creature's wounds to heal slowly. Strike with your claw or jaws. This attack deals negative damage instead of its normal type; on a hit, the target halves any healing it receives until the start of your next turn. The target or an adjacent ally can spend two Interact actions to squeeze the enzymes from the wound and remove the effect.</p>\n<p>If you are satiated, when you hit you can choose to end your satiation and boost your enzymes, increasing the duration to 1 minute.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Grave Strength]{Grave Strength} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The flesh you've consumed over the course of your existence as a ghoul has made you stronger, gifting you with strange insights from the minds of the sapient creatures you've devoured and bringing you closer to a state of undead perfection. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Advanced Undead Benefits]{Advanced Undead Benefits}. In addition, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed while you're satiated.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Paralyzing Slash]{Paralyzing Slash} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Feverish Enzymes</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your enzymes can paralyze your foes rather than merely making it harder for them to heal their wounds. Strike with your claw or jaws. If you hit a living non-elf creature, it becomes paralyzed unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Regardless of the result of the save, the creature is temporarily immune to Paralyzing Slash for 24 hours. A creature that becomes paralyzed can attempt a new save to end the paralysis at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Sickening Bite]{Sickening Bite} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your saliva causes severe nausea and mild fever in the living, weakening them so that you can more easily finish them off. When you critically hit a creature with your jaws, the creature is sickened 1. This is a disease effect.</p>\n<p>If you are satiated, you can end your satiation to make the target sickened 1 on a regular hit instead.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Glutton For Flesh]{Glutton For Flesh} Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have developed a capacity to store more flesh within your gaunt body to leave yourself satiated longer. If you Consume Flesh while satiated, you become fully satiated. You stay fully satiated for 3 hours, after which you become satiated for 1 hour. If you're fully satiated when an ability would end your satiation, you cease being fully satiated but remain satiated. If you have Grave Strength, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed when fully satiated instead of a +5-foot status bonus for being satiated.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Corpse Stench]{Corpse Stench} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your body exudes an overwhelming scent of decay in a 10-foot emanation, so putrid that it nauseates creates within that range. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be sickened (plus slowed 1 on a critical failure). While within the aura, the creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to Corpse Stench for 1 minute.</p>",

                "content": "<p>It's quite common for mages of all sorts to study necromancy-the surprisingly diverse school holds the secrets of positive and negative energy, as well as life and death. Many tap into these powers with no consideration of the morality of their use. For these unscrupulous magic users, it's simply another avenue in their never-ending pursuit of power, and the abilities learned are turned to the caster's personal ends, whatever they may be.</p>\n<p>Others choose a different path. Through spiritual study and introspection, they have come to recognize the evil intrinsic in the existence of undead, the fundamental wrongness of using the universal energy of death to create an appearance of life. To combat this evil, these casters learn to conduct positive energy and direct it to great effect against the undead they encounter. They may also engage in ongoing study to learn of the nature of life, death, and undeath, and the precise relationship between each state. These scholars and mages are commonly known as hallowed necromancers-a slightly misrepresentative name, as many of them don't use religious methods, but a frequently used shorthand regardless.</p>\n<p>The exact origin of hallowed necromancers' abilities may vary from one to the next. Some are granted their gifts directly by a sympathetic deity such as Sarenrae or Pharasma, while others might use their knowledge of religion and the planes to learn such abilities on their own. Though rarer, it's even possible these practitioners might discover they possess an intuitive understanding and control over abilities that manifest spontaneously as their capabilities grow. Despite this variance, all share a fundamental understanding that undeath is an aberration to be quickly remedied.</p>\n<p>Though the majority of hallowed necromancers have similar goals and are willing to work together, they tend not to form their own organizations. More often, these necromancers attach themselves to existing groups-such as the Knights of Lastwall or Voices of the Spire-and use their powers in support of those groups' causes. Otherwise, they plan and carry out their own personal vendettas against the forces of undeath, often enlisting the help of trusted friends and allies.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">HALLOWED NECROMANCY IN GEB\n<p>As hallowed necromancy lacks any unified credo, its practitioners are found throughout Golarion. It's rare they make their presence known within the borders of Geb, however. Those who hide their profession usually move on to other lands and those who openly crusade against Geb's many undead quickly find themselves utterly overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>Hallowed necromancers captured in Geb might be executed only to be risen by their foes with their spellcasting ability intact but moral code absent or twisted.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Hallowed Necromancer Dedication]{Hallowed Necromancer Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> good alignment, able to cast spells using spell slots, able to cast at least one necromancy spell, expert in Religion</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've studied techniques allowing you to blend so-called hallowed necromancy into your own spellcasting to bolster the living and destroy the undead. You gain the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Hallowed Ground]{Hallowed Ground}</em> focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Refocus]{Refocus} activity. You can Refocus by meditating or praying to connect yourself to conduits of positive energy. Focus spells from the hallowed necromancer archetype have the same tradition as your spell slots. Casting spells that create, heal, or otherwise aid or promote undead is anathema to you, as is cooperation with undead. Using negative energy isn't anathema, as it serves a natural purpose, but twisting that negative energy for creation is blasphemous to you. If you perform acts that are anathema to your principles, you lose access to all feats from this archetype.

Qualifying characters with the Lastwall sentry archetype can select one of these dedications even without gaining three feats from the Lastwall sentry archetype, and each of these archetypes' feats fulfills the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Lastwall Sentry Dedication]{Lastwall Sentry Dedication}'s special requirement despite not being from the Lastwall sentry archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Knight Vigilant Dedication]{Knight Vigilant} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Religion, any good alignment, member of the Knights of Lastwall of knight rank</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You are dedicated to the cause of the Shining Sentinels.

When in proximity to the undead, you eventually sense their presence, though you might not do so instantly, and you can't pinpoint their location. An undead using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence must attempt a Deception check against your Perception DC to hide its presence from you.

Despite the trials you underwent and decades spent sequestered away with magical tomes, you know with every fiber of your being that it's all been worth it. You devised a unique and incredibly evil ritual to tear your soul from your body, and you painstakingly crafted a receptacle to house your freed soul. Immortality now lies within your grasp.</p>\n<p>Becoming a lich requires much more than just magical knowledge. It demands fierce intelligence, bold ingenuity, incredible determination, unending patience, and a strict adherence to perfection, along with incredible skill as an artisan, for each lich must create their own soul cage. A mispronounced word or flaw in the construction of your soul cage would end not in immortality but ignominious death. You have all these skills in abundance and now, with your ascension, you've proven your superiority beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p>\n<p>As a lich, you understand better than any the power and potential of magic. Many liches strive to increase their magical skills and foil the magic of any who dare oppose them. Others delve so deeply into necromantic arts and foul rituals that their flesh can burn the living, causing biological processes to falter and filling those who behold them with uncontrollable fear.</p>\n<p>Regardless of what paths they pursue, nearly all liches are obsessed with their soul cage, spending untold hours and a veritable fortune to protect it, surrounding it with magical and mundane hazards, and guarding it with powerful, loyal defenders. Some liches prefer to secure their soul cage through obscurity rather than force, enshrouding it in magical abjurations or illusions to hide it from prying eyes. The most gifted crafters among liches tinker and improve their soul cage over time, rendering it nigh indestructible. This is a dangerous proposition, undertaken by only the most confident and arrogant magical engineers, as physically altering one's soul cage could have unintended consequences on its function. Many wizard liches instead learn to tap into the soul cage's magical energy from afar to fuel their own spellcasting.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats</strong>: 14th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Magic Sense]{Magic Sense}</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:left\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Lich Dedication]{Lich Dedication} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> living creature, ability to cast 6th-level or higher spells from spell slots, expert in Crafting, completed ritual to become a lich and crafted a soul cage</p>\n<hr />\n<p>After years of study and careful planning, you finally completed a soul cage to house your soul and successfully performed a ritual to transform yourself into a lich. Now, neither death nor time can prevent you from pursuing your studies and achieving your grand ambitions. You gain the undead trait and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Basic Undead Benefits]{Basic Undead Benefits}. Your undead craving is for knowledge. You gain a unique soul cage—a magic item that houses your soul. Whenever you would die, your soul flees to the soul cage to allow you to be rebuilt. As long as your soul cage exists, you can't truly be destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the lich archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Drain Soul Cage]{Drain Soul Cage} Feat 14</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Lich Dedication, Drain Bonded Item, spellbook</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You make your soul cage into your bonded item, allowing you to harness its abundant magical energy. Once per day, when you use Drain Bonded Item, you can choose any spell in your spellbook that you can cast, even if you haven't prepared or cast it that day. Your soul cage doesn't need to be on your person for you to use Drain Bonded Item. If your soul cage is broken or destroyed, you can't use Drain Soul Cage. Even if you can Drain Bonded Item more than once per day, for instance if you are a universalist wizard, you can still only choose a spell you haven't prepared and cast once per day.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Enshroud Soul Cage]{Enshroud Soul Cage} Feat 14</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Lich Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You wreathe your soul cage in an ever-growing collection of obfuscating illusions and protective abjurations to hide it from your enemies. You disguise the soul cage as any non-magical object of the same Bulk, and it gains the effects of the magic aura and nondetection spells. The effects have unlimited durations, are heightened to half your level rounded up, and use your spell DC against any attempt to counteract them. The magic aura makes your soul cage appear non-magical. You can ignore the effects of any of these spells when dealing with your own soul cage. You are mentally alerted whenever your soul cage is damaged.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Hand of the Lich]{Hand of the Lich} Feat 14</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Lich Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Negative energy intensifies your undead form and makes your very touch the antithesis of life. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Advanced Undead Benefits]{Advanced Undead Benefits}. The damage die for your fist increases to 1d6 instead of 1d4, it deals negative damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and it loses the nonlethal trait. Your fist becomes magical. When you critically hit a living creature with your fist Strike, the creature is slowed 1 until the end of your next turn unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your spell DC. This is a critical specialization effect.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Bolster Soul Cage]{Bolster Soul Cage} Feat 16</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Lich Dedication, legendary in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your constant efforts to augment and perfect your soul cage have bolstered its efficiency. Your soul cage has Hardness equal to your level and HP equal to four times your level. The time it takes your soul cage to rebuild your body is reduced to 1d6 days rather than 1d10 days. At 20th level, the time it takes your soul cage to rebuild your body is reduced to 2d12+12 hours.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Gem]{Spell Gem} Feat 16</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Lich Dedication, legendary in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Inspired by the degenerate demiliches your kind sometimes devolves into, you've embedded a gem into your brow, fusing it to your necrotic flesh.

You must decide which spell your gem contains when you take this feat; changing the spell requires retraining the feat. Once per day, you can drain the gem's magical energy to Cast the Spell without spending a spell slot. At 18th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 7th level. At 20th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 8th level; regardless of which spell you chose, you can instead drain the gem's magical energy to cast an 8th-level spell turning without spending a spell slot.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Frightful Aura]{Frightful Aura} Feat 18</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Lich Dedication, master in Intimidation</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You're surrounded by a palpable sense of menace and power that's terrifying to behold. The aura is a 15-foot emanation. An enemy that enters or ends its turn in the aura must attempt a Will save against the higher of your spell DC or class DC.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune to your Frightful Aura for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is frightened 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is frightened 2.</p>",

If the triggering effect's targets speak either the original language or the one you translated into, they are affected.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Analyze Idiolect]{Analyze Idiolect} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Linguist Dedication, expert in Deception and Society</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You break down a specific individual's idiolect, memorizing their speech mannerisms and habits. If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, when you later attempt to Impersonate that individual, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Deception checks and DCs. Due to the intense character study required, you can't remember more than one idiolect at a time.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Read Shibboleths]{Read Shibboleths} Feat 7</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Linguist Dedication, master in Society</p>\n<hr />\n<p>All communication is filled with slight tells and signals. If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, their regional words, pronunciation changes, and nonverbal cues provide you with a minor fact about their social environment, such as their hometown or certain groups they might belong to. If a target of this ability is being deceptive about their social environment, such as a commoner pretending to be a noble, they must attempt a Deception, Society, or appropriate Lore check against your Society DC, providing you a false minor fact consistent with their assumed identity on a success.</p>\n<p>Once you've gleaned one or more true minor facts about a person, you can then incorporate these mannerisms into your speech to present yourself in a way that they find familiar.

If you interact with a creature for at least 10 minutes and that creature can speak a language, the GM rolls a secret Society check with a DC appropriate for the language's rarity. On a success, you understand the gist of the meaning and can communicate basic concepts back to the creature; on a failure, you are mistaken or communicate incorrect concepts. If you're legendary in Society, you can communicate instantly without needing to attempt a Society check; even if you didn't know the medium of communication the creature uses (speech, sign language, and so on), you intuit this information as soon as they try to communicate.</p>",

Halcyon spells are spells from the arcane or primal spell list. You don't gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell levels of halcyon spells only through feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your class; for example, a wizard who gained halcyon spells would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire.

Though you can still wear it as a mask, you can detach it from your face to grant it a bodily form of colored light that allows it to move around; usually, this is a miniature form of the animal the mask represents. Detaching or reattaching the familiar to transform it is a two-action activity. Even in mask form, the familiar can move around on its master's face and speaks in a distinct voice (if it can talk). It is easily recognized as more than a simple mask unless the familiar succeeds at a Deception check to Impersonate a mask. Other than its appearance and the fact that it can be worn, it functions as other familiars. Your mask familiar has access to the mask freeze familiar ability</p><p><strong>Mask Freeze</strong> When in mask form, your familiar can hide its obvious supernatural qualities to pass as a simple, unassuming mask.

You don't need to eat or drink and need only 6 hours of rest to feel well rested. You must still rest at least 8 hours and spend 1 hour of preparation to regain resources usable only a limited number of times per day, such as spell slots.</p><p>You can draw on primal power to stay awake and alert while otherwise resting your body and mind, gaining the full benefits of an 8-hour rest without falling asleep.

Select any number of targets of the spell and reduce the spell's damage to those targets by an amount equal to the spell's level. Until your next turn, when one of those targets damages you, that damage is reduced by twice the spell's level.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Uzunjati Storytelling]{Uzunjati Storytelling} Feat 6</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, Uzunjati affiliation, master in a Recall Knowledge skill</p><hr /><p>You tell a quick story or begin telling a longer tale. This is most useful when you want to prove your scholarly credibility or impress someone quickly. Roll a check with a skill that can be used to Recall Knowledge in which you have expert proficiency, using the result entry for the Perform action. Like Performing, Storytelling rarely has an effect on its own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent Diplomacy checks against the observers-or even change their attitudes-if the GM sees fit. This action is not a Performance and cannot be used in place of anything that requires you to Perform.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Cascade Bearer's Spellcasting]{Cascade Bearer's Spellcasting} Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, Cascade Bearers affiliation</p><hr /><p>Your Cascade Bearer training allows you to broaden the horizons of your halcyon spells further than most Magaambyans, weaving in spiritual magic. You can select halcyon spells from the divine or occult spell lists in additional to the arcane or primal spell lists, though they are still halcyon spells (so you choose when casting if they are arcane or primal spells). You gain a halcyon cantrip and a halcyon 1st-level spell.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Emerald Boughs Hideaway]{Emerald Boughs Hideaway} Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, Emerald Boughs affiliation</p><hr /><p>You use Emerald Bough techniques to create a small extradimensional space called a hideaway that lasts as long as you are conscious. The hideaway functions as a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Bag of Holding (Type I)]{Bag of Holding (Type I)}, but has no Bulk and takes no hands; it holds one object with a maximum Bulk equal to your highest mental ability score modifier; as you open the hideaway with pure thought, activating it to retrieve an item is a free action with the envision component instead of a single action with the Interact component. The hideaway's access point appears as an obviously magical gap within 1 foot of your body. Only you can access the hideaway; you can you use an Interact action each round to physically hold it open for another person. A successful dispel magic spell or similar effect against your spell DC and the hideaway's counteract level of 2 expels the object; the object is also expelled if you become unconscious. After a successful dispel magic spell or when you become conscious again, the hideaway immediately reforms with no additional action from you. You can also dismiss the hideaway (if it is empty) or re-form it using a single action with the envision component.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Rain-Scribe Mobility]{Rain-Scribe Mobility} Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, Rain- Scribes affiliation</p><hr /><p>You surround yourself in a mantle of Rain-Scribe magic and Stride twice; difficult terrain does not reduce your Speed, even if the difficult terrain has been manipulated by magic. Your magic clears the difficult terrain in each square you entered; until your next turn, those squares aren't difficult terrain for any creature walking through them (or are normal difficult terrain if they were previously greater difficult terrain).</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Tempest-Sun Shielding]{Tempest-Sun Shielding} Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Tempest-Sun Redirection</p><p><strong>Trigger</strong> You or an ally within 30 feet takes damage.</p><hr /><p>You transform unrealized spell energy into a protective shield. If you're a spontaneous spellcaster, expend a spell slot; if you're a prepared spellcaster, expend a spell prepared in a spell slot. Reduce the triggering damage by an amount equal to four times the level of the expended slot or spell.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Uzunjati Recollection]{Uzunjati Recollection} Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Uzunjati Storytelling, master in a Recall Knowledge skill</p><hr /><p>You tell a story spontaneously from nearly forgotten facts, delving into your memory and entertaining your audience in the process. Recall Knowledge with a skill in which you have master proficiency, then use Uzunjati Storytelling with the same skill. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your skill check for Uzunjati Storytelling from the added details.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Janatimo's Lessons]{Janatimo's Lessons} Feat 12</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Uzunjati Recollection</p><hr /><p>Thanks to Janatimo's secret techniques, you can weave your knowledge and words into powerful tools to assist your allies in life-threatening situations. When you use Uzunjati Recollection to tell a story and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Recall Knowledge]{Recall Knowledge} about a creature during a combat encounter, if you succeed at both checks, your story carries deeper meaning. This grants your allies a +1 circumstance bonus to their next attack roll and saving throw against the creature during that encounter, as well as to their AC against that creature's next attack roll during that encounter. If you critically succeed at both checks, the bonuses also apply to all attack rolls, saves, and AC against that creature for 2 rounds.</p>",

Everyone has a crucial role to play.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Overwatch Training</h4>\n<p>Not just anyone can train to become their party's overwatch. A keen and incisive perception is necessary, of course, but that alone won't be sufficient. While many a ranger or rogue must sharpen their senses or face a short career, a true overwatch must be able to apply information received from all five senses (and any additional special senses they might have) to make split-second decisions that work toward achieving a tactical goal. Such a response can partially be trained through hours of daily drills designed to help a potential overwatch separate true threats and situations requiring their skills from false positives, and even situations where they would cause a problem if they didn't hold back. However, while training helps ingrain good practice into one's reflexes and muscle memory, ultimately, an overwatch candidate who lacks an innate degree of good tactical instinct will find such training slow to produce results, or in the worst case, even impossible.</p>\n<p>Beyond senses and instinct, the role of overwatch requires the ability to innovate your enhanced visual gear to assist in removing blind spots and seeing what others miss. This is essential, since you must keep track of your team and nearby foes. While it isn't explicitly necessary for you to be the one with enough skill in Crafting to maintain and upgrade your enhanced visual gear, many successful overwatches choose to do so in order to better understand how every piece works together to create the whole.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Overwatch Dedication]{Overwatch Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Perception</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have an innate knack for tactical observation, and you've innovated to apply that knack in a variety of ways that allow you to assist your allies.

You become trained in one skill of your choice, or expert in a skill of your choice in which you were trained. You also become trained in Pathfinder Lore, or an expert if you were already trained. When using a skill untrained, your proficiency bonus is equal to your level instead of 0. You gain access to wayfinders.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Pathfinder Agent archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Careful Explorer]{Careful Explorer} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've explored enough dusty tombs and hidden vaults to gain a sixth sense about traps, and you sometimes notice them even when you're not trying to. Even if you aren't Searching in exploration mode, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to Search for them.

When you successfully Aid an attack roll or AC, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls or AC against that enemy until the end of your next turn, whichever you granted to your ally. When you successfully Aid a skill check, if you attempt the exact same skill check (not just using the same skill, but using it for the same purpose, for instance a check to Climb the same wall) on your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your skill check.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Environmental Explorer]{Environmental Explorer} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've traversed enough untamed wilderness to gain an intuitive understanding of the dangers that exist in such places. Your extensive familiarity means you sometimes notice perils even when you're not trying to.

Attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about a creature you can see, adding your level as a proficiency bonus if you are untrained (rather than 0). If you roll a failure (but not a critical failure) on this check, you get a success instead.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spiritual Explorer]{Spiritual Explorer} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You're familiar with the danger that lingering spirits can pose to an unwary adventurer, and you're particularly attuned to their presence.

Keep track of each type of creature you successfully identify with Recall Knowledge. When attempting Recall Knowledge checks against creatures on your list in later encounters, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and you learn an additional fact about such creatures on a success.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Watch and Learn]{Watch and Learn} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An ally you can see succeeds or critically succeeds at a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check, using a skill in which you are untrained.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Pathfinder agents serve as members of diverse teams with complementary skill sets. You are practiced at following the example of a more skilled ally to accomplish a wide variety of tasks.

This does not allow you to attempt trained actions using that skill unless you would otherwise be able to do so.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer]{Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can use the unusual resonance of your wayfinder to grant it additional effects. Choose one cantrip from the arcane, divine, occult, or primal list. You can activate your wayfinder to cast that cantrip at will. Additionally, you can Activate your wayfinder with a Single Action (envision) activation to transform it into a nondescript pin or brooch to hide your affiliation with the Pathfinder Society.

Depending on whether you use gestures or call out, this free action gains either the visual or auditory trait.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Craft Facsimile]{Craft Facsimile} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Crafting, Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You're renowned for your ability to recover important items, whether they're from a long-abandoned temple or a thieves' den, and sometimes that requires creating a stand-in. You can spend 1 minute to assemble a facsimile of an object of no more than 1 Bulk that you can see from available materials. The facsimile has the same shape and Bulk as the replaced object and can pass as the object if not examined. A creature familiar with the original who examines the object automatically realizes that it is a fake. A creature not familiar with the original can still tell it was a hastily jury-rigged stand-in of some kind, but they might not know the object was supposed to be something else.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Discerning Strike]{Discerning Strike} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication, Thorough Reports</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have successfully identified the target with Recall Knowledge during this combat.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Identifying a creature is the first step in finding its weaknesses. Attempt a Strike against the target; if successful, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage. If you have succeeded on a Recall Knowledge check against the target during this combat and their creature type was previously recorded using Thorough Reports, you also deal [[/r 1[bleed]]] damage. The creature is then temporarily immune to Discerning Strike for 1 day.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Forced Entry]{Forced Entry} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Athletics, Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You are trained to preserve the archaeological value of your location when entering.

When making your daily preparations, you can choose one 1st-level spell from your spellbook or spell repertoire and store it in your wayfinder. You can cast this spell from the wayfinder using the normal actions required. Once the spell has been cast, it is expended, and you must make your next daily preparations to store another spell in your wayfinder.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Diverse Recognition]{Diverse Recognition} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication, master in a skill used to Recall Knowledge</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You successfully Recall Knowledge about a creature you can see, using a skill in which you are a master.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your Pathfinder training allows you to quickly size up numerous threats.

You must still meet the requirements to attempt this check.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Recognize Threat]{Recognize Threat} Feat 8</h2>\n<div><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in a Recall Knowledge skill, Pathfinder Agent Dedication\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have master proficiency in a skill to identify the triggering creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your first turn of an encounter begins, and you can see a creature.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p>You quickly assess the threat so you can relay the information to your team. Attempt a Recall Knowledge check against the triggering creature.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Snap Out Of It! (Pathfinder Agent)]{Snap Out Of It!} Feat 8</h2>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication, master in Medicine</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Pathfinders are trained to help each other be safe and successful, and you know how to jolt your allies back to their senses. Attempt a Medicine check on an adjacent ally who is fascinated, frightened, stunned, or stupefied and choose one of those conditions. The DC is the DC for the effect that caused the condition.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 2. If you chose fascinated, that condition ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose fascinated, that condition ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You increase the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose fascinated, increase the duration by 1 round instead.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Wayfinder Resonance Infiltrator]{Wayfinder Resonance Infiltrator} Feat 8</h2>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication, Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You are adept at using the unusual resonance of your wayfinder to aid in any deceptions you might employ. Once per day you can activate your wayfinder to cast illusory disguise, heightened to 2nd level, as an arcane spell. Additionally, once per day, you can Activate your wayfinder with a single-action envision activation to transform it into a perfect replica of another similarly sized badge of membership or office, such as an Aspis Consortium badge. This transformation lasts for 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Eidetic Memorization]{Eidetic Memorization} Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Pathfinders are often asked to study the intricacies of ancient history under less than ideal conditions, and you've trained your brain to make the most of your limited time. You quickly memorize an inscription, scroll, or other piece of writing you can clearly see whose length is equivalent to no more than one page. You can then accurately recreate this writing using a writing kit, wax tablet, or other writing medium, once you have reached safety. You don't need to understand the writing or identify the language to reproduce it. Your memory lasts until the next time you make your daily preparations; if you have not written down or otherwise recreated what you saw by this point, your memory fades and any attempt to recreate what you saw is garbled and unintelligible. You can have only one piece of writing memorized at a time; any previous memorization fades the next time you use this ability.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Everyone Duck!]{Everyone Duck!} Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You fail, but don't critically fail, an attempt to Disable a Device on a trap.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You intentionally set off the trap, but you take special precautions to protect yourself and your allies from the trap's effects. For the next 2 rounds, if the trap rolls a critical success on an attack roll, it gets a normal success instead, and if anyone rolls a critical failure on their saving throw against the trap, they get a normal failure instead.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Educated Assessment]{Educated Assessment} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You attempt to Recall Knowledge about a creature, and the GM uses the same secret roll result against the creature's Deception or Stealth DC, giving you the information from a Battle Assessment. You might get a different degree of success on the Recall Knowledge check than what you get for the Battle Assessment. If you have the Battle Assessment feat, you gain the effects of Educated Assessment whenever you Recall Knowledge (such as with the Automatic Knowledge feat).</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Swap Investment]{Swap Investment} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your time as a Pathfinder has taught you how to improvise, and you've learned to make use of the resources you find in the field.

You choose the path the target takes, and it does so as part of your Walk the Plank action. You can't force the target to move into a harmful space (one where it will take damage, fall, provoke reactions, or similar) unless the result of your check to Demoralize was a critical success.

As a pistol phenom, you understand how to grab everyone's attention with everything you do, especially the way you talk, the way you walk, and the way you use your gun. But what's more, you're well aware of that fact and the power you have over others, and you aren't afraid to flaunt it.</p>\n<p>Despite this attitude, or perhaps because of it, as a pistol phenom you likely tend to get along well with groups of allies, understanding both how to take the spotlight to protect your allies and how to share it to make sure they get their time in the sun. The one exception to this can be other pistol phenoms. When two or more pistol phenoms gather in the same group, it's almost inevitable for a duel or other contest to arise. However, such a contest need not end in enmity. Depending on your temperament, and that of the other pistol phenom, the result of the exhilarating rivalry expressed during competition could be a lifelong friendship, albeit one in which you both keep score of your greatest achievements to compare exploits.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Pistol Phenom Dedication]{Pistol Phenom Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in at least one type of one-handed firearm, trained in Deception, trained in Performance</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You catch an opponent off-guard by spinning your weapon.

Taking down a target without giving away your position or giving the opponent a window for reprisal is difficult work that requires teamwork and coordination, as well as a tight-knit bond and shared perspective. Sniping duos live and die by the credo \"two heads are better than one,\" focusing their skills and strategies toward deadly efficiency.

The mechanics of the archetype are not very demanding of your spotter's actions, but that still doesn't mean every player is interested in the narrative component.</p>\n<p>Mechanically, a good spotter is likely either another ranged attacker or a melee attacker, and depending on the type of spotter you choose, certain feats might become more or less enticing.

As part of your training in this archetype, you train your spotter in the necessary habits and techniques to use your abilities automatically; your spotter doesn't need to spend any feats of their own to grant the effects. You only gain the benefits of your Sniping Duo archetype feats if both you and your spotter are alive and conscious. You and your spotter don't grant your foes lesser cover against one another's Strikes. Whenever you or your spotter successfully Strikes a target, the other member of your duo gains a +1 circumstance bonus per weapon damage die on the damage roll of their next Strike made against that target before the end of their next turn. You can change your designated spotter by spending 3 days of downtime training with another ally.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the sniping duo archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Triangulate]{Triangulate} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Sniping Duo Dedication]{Sniping Duo Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your spotter's quick signals help you make even difficult shots seem simple.

If your next action is to make a ranged Strike, you treat your spotter's position as your own for the purposes of determining cover and range. Your spotter must be within your weapon's first range increment and they must use a reaction to redirect your shot.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Duo's Aim]{Duo's Aim} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Sniping Duo Dedication]{Sniping Duo Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>With assistance from your spotter, you aim for an especially accurate attack. Make a ranged weapon Strike against a foe either within your spotter's melee reach or the first range increment of a ranged weapon your spotter is wielding. On this Strike, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and ignore the target's concealment. If you're using a firearm with the kickback trait, you don't take the normal circumstance penalty to this Strike for not having the required Strength score or firing without using a tripod.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Vantage Shot]{Vantage Shot} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Sniping Duo Dedication]{Sniping Duo Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You and your spotter take advantage of each other's attacks to momentarily hide and throw your foes off-balance against your follow-up attack.

On a success, the foe is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} against the spotter's next attack before the end of your spotter's next turn. Similarly, when your spotter successfully makes a ranged Strike against a foe, you can use a reaction to attempt a Stealth check against the foe's Perception DC.

If you used Tag Team after your spotter missed the triggering Strike, make a ranged Strike against the same target with a -2 penalty. If you used this reaction after you missed the triggering Strike, your spotter can use their reaction to make a melee or ranged Strike against the same target.

If you and your spotter both use the Ready activity to make a Strike against the same opponent and choose the same trigger for the readied action, resolve your attacks at the same time. Each of you can use the higher of the two attack rolls for your Strikes, each using your own modifier; this is a fortune effect.

Judged souls proceed to their assigned planes, becoming petitioners. These, too, die in time, becoming absorbed by and expanding their associated plane, as their own spiritual essence joins with the plane's as a substance known as quintessence.

You must be within 60 feet of the possessed creature or object, or of the receptacle imprisoning the soul.

For 3 rounds, your Strikes and spells deal additional damage against undead, creatures in possession of an imprisoned soul, or creatures you have witnessed create or command undead. You gain a status bonus to damage with your Strikes against these creatures equal to the number of weapon damage dice. Spells you cast from spell slots gain a status bonus to damage against these creatures equal to the level of the spell; this bonus applies only to spells that deal damage and don't have a duration.</p>\n<p>If your spiral is glowing, you can target a willing creature in its light.

You manifest an armor, shield, or weapon as a soulforged armament. Choose one essence power for the armament. Changing an essence power requires 1 week of retraining, and you can't retrain it while you have <em>soulforged corruption</em>.</p>\n<p>You can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Manifest Soulforged Armament]{Manifest Soulforged Armament} to summon your armaments in combat.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat before gaining two other feats from this archetype.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>ESSENCE POWERS</h3>\n<p>Your soulforged armament has an essence power you choose when you first bind it. It gains the power temporarily when you manifest its essence form. Each power has a corruption flaw that affects you if you have <em>soulforged corruption</em>. Essence powers that only apply to some types of armament indicate which.</p>\n<p><strong>Adaptable Persona</strong> (transmutation) Armor only. When you manifest the essence form, gain your choice of a climb Speed or swim Speed equal to your land Speed. If you're 8th level or higher, you can choose a fly Speed instead. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> You take a -10-foot penalty to all your Speeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Bounding Spirit</strong> Melee weapon only. The weapon gains the thrown 30 feet trait and has the returning rune (even if it already has its maximum number of property runes). <em>Corruption Flaw</em> When you make a Strike with a thrown or ranged weapon and miss, reroll the Strike, targeting your ally nearest to the target. This Strike uses the same multiple attack penalty as the missed Strike and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Deep-Seeded Fear</strong> You gain a +2 status bonus to your Intimidation checks and don't take any penalties for not sharing a language when Demoralizing foes who can perceive your armament's essence form. When you manifest the essence form, you can attempt to Demoralize an enemy who can perceive the manifestation. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> If you attempt to Demoralize an enemy, your Demoralize also targets the ally closest to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Determined Toughness</strong> Any status penalties you take from the following conditions are 1 less than their condition's value: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Clumsy]{Clumsy}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Drained]{Drained}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Frightened]{Frightened}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied}. This doesn't change the actual condition value, or any other effects of the condition (such as stupefied's disruption and its DC). <em>Corruption Flaw</em> Whenever you take a status penalty from the listed conditions, you also take a -1 penalty to the same statistics.</p>\n<p><strong>Harmful Malice</strong> (necromancy, negative) Your Strikes deal an additional 1d4 negative damage. Once while the armament is manifested, you can cast harm as an innate spell, with a level equal to half your level rounded up. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> Reduce any damage you would deal by half your level.</p>\n<p><strong>Heroic Heart</strong> (enchantment, mental) You gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, Perception checks, skill checks, and saves. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> You take a -1 penalty to attack rolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Healing Grace</strong> (healing, necromancy, positive) You gain fast healing equal to half your level. You can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Heal]{Heal}</em> once as an innate spell with a level equal to half your level rounded up. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> Reduce all healing you would receive or grant with a spell by half your level.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical Resilience</strong> (abjuration) Armor or shield only. You gain a +2 status bonus to saving throws and AC against spells. If you're 5th level or higher, you can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Dispel Magic]{Dispel Magic}</em> once as an innate spell. The spell level is equal to 1 lower than half your level rounded up (2nd level if you're 5th or 6th level, and so on). <em>Corruption Flaw</em> You take a -1 penalty to saving throws and AC against spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Planar Bond</strong> (abjuration) Armor or shield only. When you manifest the essence form, choose one damage type: acid, chaotic, cold, electricity, evil, fire, good, lawful, negative, positive, or sonic. You gain resistance equal to your level + 2 to damage of the selected type. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> You gain weakness 1 to all damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Planar Pain</strong> (evocation) Weapon only. When you manifest the essence form, choose one damage type: acid, chaotic, cold, electricity, evil, fire, good, lawful, negative, positive, or sonic. Attacks with the weapon deal this type of damage instead of their physical damage with a +2 status bonus to the damage. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> When you deal damage with a weapon or unarmed attack, you take 2 damage of the last type you chose for planar pain, even if the damage type normally wouldn't harm you, such as good damage if you aren't evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Pull of Stasis</strong> (transmutation) Weapon only. Any time you hit with the soulforged weapon, the target takes a -10-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. On a critical hit, the creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Immobilized]{Immobilized} for 1 round instead. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> You take a -10-foot penalty to all your Speeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflecting Spirit</strong> Armor or shield only. You gain a +2 status bonus to AC against physical ranged attacks. If an enemy's physical ranged attack misses you, you can use your reaction to immediately attempt a ranged Strike against the attacker using the projectile that missed. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> You have weakness 5 to physical ranged attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Resolute Defiance</strong> Shield only. The shield gains a +2 status bonus to its Hardness and gains temporary Hit Points equal to your level + 2 that last until the essence effect ends. If you don't have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Shield Block]{Shield Block} reaction, you gain it while your shield is manifested. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> When you take damage while Raising a Shield or use Shield Block, attempt a DC 5 flat check. If you fail, the shield is Dismissed if it's your soulforged armament or Dropped if it's a different shield.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Soul Flare]{Soul Flare} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Soulforger Dedication]{Soulforger Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An attack you made with a soulforged weapon or shield misses a creature, or a creature hits you with an attack while you're either wearing manifested soulforged armor or have your soulforged shield raised.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> Your soulforged armament is manifested.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You strive to change the outcome with sheer zeal. You gain a +1 status bonus to your attack roll if making an attack or to your AC if you were hit. This can change the outcome of the roll. If this bonus turns your missed attack into a hit or the hit against you into a miss, attempt a DC 5 flat check. If you fail, your soulforged armament is Dismissed-your weapon if you attacked or your armor or shield if you were defending.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Rapid Manifestation]{Rapid Manifestation} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Soulforger Dedication]{Soulforger Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You roll initiative or a hazard attacks you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your unwavering soul brings up your defenses as soon as you're in danger.

Upgrade and change armaments individually.</p>\n<p>When you Manifest Soulforged Armament, you can summon any number of your armaments (you must meet the Requirements for each), and when you Dismiss the effect, you can choose to Dismiss some and not others. You can choose to manifest the essence form of any number of your armaments when you take the action. Each armament can manifest its essence form only once per day.</p>\n<p>When you gain soulforged corruption, choose one armament's corruption flaw to affect you for stage 1. At stage 2, you take the flaws of all your soulforged armaments. While you have the curse, each armament gets a separate flat check to manifest its essence form, and failing prevents you from manifesting only that armament's essence form.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat a second time at 12th level or higher, choosing the final item type.</p>",

                "content": "<p>Just as Golarion's merchants scour busy marketplaces for newfound goods, scholars of magic congregate in teahouses, debate at symposia, and haunt the back rooms of esoteric shops to swap secrets of their trade. In such meetings, a different kind of magic may strike: the spark of innovation! The mixing of magical techniques produces fascinating and unpredictable results. As one of these innovators, sometimes called a spell trickster, you have a knack for pioneering magical techniques and discovering new effects from spells most novice spellcasters take for granted. Whether your unique abilities are the result of weeks of experimentation or a secret passed to you by a traveling practitioner, you delight in surprising others with your tricks.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>The Fruits of Research</h4>\n<p>While magic can spring from many sources, from wizard tutors to self-taught savants, the art of the spell trickster often springs from sophisticated magical research. The magical academies in Golarion have no claim to magic as a whole but can often teach lesser-known variants of a spell to their students. At the Magaambya academy in the Mwangi Expanse, for instance, initiates study multiple traditions of magic, adapting the techniques of harnessing magical essence from one tradition to create new methods of casting spells in another. The Arclords of Nex have spent thousands of years honing spells in both wartime and peace, demonstrating a fine control over the arcane by effortlessly changing their magic to suit their whims. The return of New Thassilon brought thousands of magical dabblers and scholars, each with their own unique tricks and each eager to see what new spell variants have developed in their long absence.</p>\n<p>This isn't to say that spell tricksters come solely from high academia. A sorcerer might demonstrate aberrant powers in her bloodline magic, hinting at a background more complex than a single eldritch influence acting upon her. An oracle might grope at a divine power that they poorly understand and cast a spell in a unique manner simply because they were never taught otherwise. A witch's patron or a whimsical deity might grant a favored servant a special power for whatever strange motives such beings might possess. Magic in Golarion isn't entirely predictable, no matter how many practitioners wish that it was so. While most spellcasters follow predictable patterns in their art, there are always exceptions.</p>\n<p>The rules in this section are presented as part of an archetype, meant for a character dedicated to the art of innovating magic—but you don't have to limit yourself to this premise. At the GM's discretion, a spell trickster feat could be made available to a character as a class feat without the character taking the archetype. In most cases, this option should only be offered as a reward or story element that the character, GM, or group has dedicated a significant amount of time to developing—a character who wishes to partake in these options without GM permission or involvement should simply take the spell trickster archetype. These feats could be used to represent the payoff from extended magical research; finding forgotten or forbidden lore in a lost corner of Golarion; pleasing a god, patron, or other notable power; a magical plane or artifact exerting its influence; or any other number of situations that an adventurer might encounter while exploring. Keep in mind, however, that these feats were created and balanced to be part of an archetype. If allowing spell trickster feats as general class feats begins to negatively impact the game, the players should be willing to walk the decision back and rebuild characters as necessary.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Trickster Dedication]{Spell Trickster Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Able to cast spells; trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your experience with magic and its traditions lets you specialize in the casting of certain spells, customizing familiar spells to create novel effects. Whenever you gain a feat from this archetype, you either learn to modify the effects of a single spell, or you change one of the modifications from a previous feat. Each time you Cast the Spell corresponding to the feat you chose, you decide whether to cast its normal or modified version. You can only apply one modification to a spell at a time, even if you know more than one modification for that spell. Besides modifications mentioned in the feat, the spell functions as normal.</p>\n<p>Choose up to two 4th-level spell trickster archetype feats for which you meet the spell-casting prerequisite. You gain those feats, ignoring their level prerequisite.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the spell trickster archetype. The two feats you gain from taking the dedication don't count toward this total.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Agile Hand]{Agile Hand} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Trickster Dedication]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Mage Hand]{Mage Hand}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast mage hand, you can modify its target to be a set of thieves' tools. When you Cast the Spell in this way, the tools move up to 20 feet towards a device or lock. After you Sustain the Spell on future turns, you can use the tools to attempt Thievery checks to Disable a Device or Pick a Lock within the spell's range, but you take a -2 penalty to your Thievery check. If you critically fail, the spell ends and you can't use this modification again for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Barrier Shield]{Barrier Shield} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Trickster Dedication]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Shield]{Shield}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast shield, you can modify the spell to create a solid barrier you can use for cover, but not for blocking. You can't use the Shield Block reaction when the spell is modified in this way, but you (and only you) can spend an action to Take Cover to gain standard cover from it.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Forceful Push]{Forceful Push} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Trickster Dedication]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Mage Hand]{Mage Hand}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast mage hand, you can modify its target to be 1 creature. If you do, replace its standard effects with the following: You push your foe telekinetically. Make a spell attack roll against the target's Fortitude DC. On a success, you push the target 5 feet away from you. On a critical success, you push the target 10 feet away from you.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Shining Arms]{Shining Arms} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Trickster Dedication]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Light]{Light}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast light, you can modify its target to be 1 melee weapon, either unattended or possessed by you or a willing ally, and modify its duration to be 1 minute. If you do, add the following to its effects: When a creature wielding the weapon critically hits a foe, you can Dismiss the Spell as a reaction, causing the foe to be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Dazzled]{Dazzled} for 1 round. After you use this reaction, you can't use this modification again for 10 minutes.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Summon Ensemble]{Summon Ensemble} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Trickster Dedication]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Summon Instrument]{Summon Instrument}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast summon instrument, you can modify its duration to be sustained, up to 1 minute. When you do, you summon a number of instruments equal to your spellcasting ability modifier that hover around you and play of their own accord. Once per turn when you Sustain the Spell, choose an opponent within 30 feet who can hear your performance. The target must attempt a Will save against the spell's DC; on a failure, it becomes distracted by your performance and becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} for 1 round. The target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Tracing Sigil]{Tracing Sigil} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Trickster Dedication]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Sigil]{Sigil}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast sigil, you can modify the spell to add the following to its standard effects: The target leaves a magical trail that you and others can try to follow. You and other creatures can attempt to Track the target, substituting an Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check (whichever matches the magical tradition of your sigil spell) for the Survival check. Much like Tracking with Survival, this must take place somewhere the target has been and follow the trail; it doesn't allow anyone to find the target from a distance. You can only have a single target marked with a modified sigil in this way. If you use this ability again on a second target, the sigil spell on the first target ends, and your mark fades.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Wild Lights]{Wild Lights} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Trickster Dedication]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Dancing Lights]{Dancing Lights}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast dancing lights, you can modify its duration to be 1 minute and modify its standard effects to create a single floating light in the shape of a Tiny creature, instead of up to four floating lights. The creature hovers over your head unless you spend a single action that has the concentrate trait to direct the light to move up to 30 feet, in which case it remains there until you direct it again. If you direct it back to your head, it hovers there and follows you again until you direct it elsewhere. If the light ever moves beyond 120 feet of you, it winks out immediately.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Animate Net]{Animate Net} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Trickster Dedication]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Animate Rope]{Animate Rope}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast animate rope, you can modify its target to be 1 net. If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You cause a net to animate and throw itself at a Medium or smaller creature within 20 feet of the net. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's Reflex DC. On a success, the target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} and takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it Escapes; on a critical success, it's also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Immobilized]{Immobilized} until it Escapes. The Escape DC is equal to your spell DC as long as the spell lasts. Once the spell ends, the Escape DC returns to the normal DC for a net (usually 16), and a creature adjacent to the target can Interact to remove the net.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Confounding Image]{Confounding Image} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Trickster Dedication]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Mirror Image]{Mirror Image}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast mirror image, you can modify its duration to be sustained up to 1 minute and modify its range to 30 feet. If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You create an illusory duplicate of yourself that appears in an unoccupied square within range. The image takes up space and has a reach of 5 feet, and your allies can flank with the image. It doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have other than an AC equal to your spell DC and saving throw modifiers equal to your spell DC - 10. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, or if you ever move more than 30 feet from it, the spell ends. Creatures can move through its space without hindrance. When you Sustain the Spell, you can move the image to an unoccupied square within range.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Disk Rider]{Disk Rider} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Trickster Dedication]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Floating Disk]{Floating Disk}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast floating disk, you can modify its duration to be sustained, up to 10 minutes. If you do, add the following heightened entry to its effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> The disk can hold up to 10 Bulk. The spell no longer ends if you ride atop the disk (though it does if any other creature rides atop it, including if the creature is riding on you). If you are riding the disk, it changes its capacity to hold you, plus additional Bulk equal to the maximum you could carry without being encumbered. If you ride atop the disk, you can direct it to move along the ground up to 30 feet or your Speed, whichever is slower, each time you Sustain the Spell. While you ride atop it, the disk can move over liquids as long as it ends its movement on solid ground. If it ends its movement on a surface that can't support it, the spell ends.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Drenching Mist]{Drenching Mist} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Trickster Dedication]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Obscuring Mist]{Obscuring Mist}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast obscuring mist, you can modify it to add the following heightened entry to its effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> Your mist is particularly laden with moisture. Non-magical fires within the area are automatically extinguished. Choose one magical fire or fire spell in the area and attempt to counteract it.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Obscured Terrain]{Obscured Terrain} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Trickster Dedication]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Obscuring Mist]{Obscuring Mist}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast obscuring mist, you can modify the spell to replace its standard effects with the following: You cause a cloud of thick fog to blanket the area, making it difficult to see the ground. The area within the fog is difficult terrain for creatures that can't see through fog or mist. You can Dismiss the cloud.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Uneasy Rest]{Uneasy Rest} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Trickster Dedication]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Sleep]{Sleep}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast sleep, you can modify the spell to add the following to its standard effects: Subjects of your spell experience troubled dreams. When a target that failed or critically failed its saving throw wakes up, it is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Frightened]{Frightened 1}.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Volatile Grease]{Volatile Grease} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spell Trickster Dedication]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Grease]{Grease}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast grease, you can modify its target to be 1 creature. If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You splash the target with combustible grease. The target must attempt a Reflex save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is splattered with grease and gains weakness 2 to fire until the end of your next turn. The target or an adjacent creature can rub off the combustible grease with an Interact action, ending the effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, except the weakness to fire lasts for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The weakness increases by 1.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Beacon Mark]{Beacon Mark} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Tracing Sigil]{Tracing Sigil}</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast sigil, you can modify the spell to add the following heightened entry.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> You attune yourself to the marked target. While the spell lasts, you can spend a single action, which has the concentrate, detection, and divination traits, to attempt to locate the target, learning the direction to the target as long as you are within 1 mile of it. If the target is a creature or a creature is in possession of the target object, the creature can attempt a Will saving throw against your spell DC. If it succeeds, your attempt to locate the target fails and you can't attempt this again for 1 day. You can only have a single target marked with a sigil modified in this way. If you Cast this Spell again on a second target, the sigil spell on the first target ends, and your mark fades.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Larcenous Hand]{Larcenous Hand} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Agile Hand]{Agile Hand}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Pickpocket]{Pickpocket} skill feat</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast mage hand, you can remove its duration, modify its range to 20 feet, and modify its target to be an attended object within the spell's Bulk limit that wouldn't be time-consuming to remove. Add the following to the spell's standard effects: If the creature attending the object is willing to have you take the item, mage hand carries the item to you. If the creature is unwilling, you must attempt to Steal the target object with a Thievery check. The usual restrictions on attempts to Steal an object apply, including the restrictions that you can't steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time-consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects) and you can't Steal from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard.

They come from a tradition of ancient secrets and principles, which they temper with modern innovation and perspective. Spellshots combine magical power into the art of gunplay to create a distinct and mystical way known only to spellshots, enigmatic and unavailable to other gunslingers in the world at large. The first to identify themselves as spellshots tied their magical traditions to the history of the Star Code and the Crowned Regents in Arcadia. Ancient, reclusive crafters known as the Crowned Regents created star guns, the legendary magical firearms that shot white-hot blasts of energy. Wielders of star guns became bound together by the Star Code—a set of cultural expectations that defined how one should behave while using these powerful weapons. You can find more information about star guns, the Crowned Regents, and the Star Code in Guns &amp; Gears.</p>\n<p>Most spellshots continue to come from Arcadia, as the stories describing the relevant skills and training to become one have been passed down over the generations. Many gunslingers who grow up in this region hear of these tales early in their lives, and they develop the techniques to channel magical energy through their firearms in imitation of the Regents' arcane methods. While Arcadia is home to the vast majority of the world's spellshots, the techniques have slowly spread to other regions. However, spellshots remain particularly rare in the Inner Sea region due to the unique history of guns there and their connection to the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, which exists in a magic-dead region of the Mana Wastes.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Spellshot Dedication]{Spellshot Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Way of the Spellshot]{Way of the Spellshot}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've steeped yourself in magic and gunplay to the extent that you can conjure bullets from thin air, using a rudimentary knowledge of arcane theory to create a temporary piece of ammunition.

                "content": "<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While many people across Golarion use prosthetic devices, you've acquired and outfitted yourself with a particularly advanced combat model of clockwork prosthesis: a piece of cutting edge technology called a sterling dynamo. You know how to maintain your dynamo and how to customize it to suit your needs and style, incorporating any promising new technologies you encounter into its design.</p>\n<p>There's a significant distinction, however, between someone who merely has a sterling dynamo prosthesis and someone like you who is a true sterling dynamo. With their recent invention, people in Absalom and Dongun Hold with access to the technology have begun to adopt sterling dynamos as their prostheses of choice, among the wide variety of amazing options already available in both markets. However, not everyone who chooses to use sterling dynamo technology is a member of the sterling dynamo archetype.</p>\n<p>With the sterling dynamo archetype, you both use a sterling dynamo prosthesis and truly understand its advantages, limitations, and limitless potential. You don't have to literally be your own mechanic, as there's no requirement for a sterling dynamo to be particularly skilled at crafting, but even if you aren't, you can still \"feel\" what's right when it comes to adjusting and optimizing your dynamo. Whether you implement these improvements yourself or present your mechanic with ideas and insights that allow them to achieve something special on your behalf, your strength and ingenuity are what make you a sterling dynamo.</p>\n<p>As you train to use your dynamo in all sorts of adventures, you may become capable of feats its original inventors never dreamed possible. In fact, as you progress in the archetype and explore the possibilities, you might find that these inventors want to interview you in order to apply your insights and help them create a new generation of the technology with even greater capabilities. The sterling dynamo's adaptability grants it vast potential, so the sky's the limit!</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Prosthetics in Golarion</h4>\n<p>Prosthetics in Golarion don't require membership in an archetype or special organization to obtain. A character can purchase a simple prosthetic foot, eye, hand, or virtually any other body part for as little as 5 silver pieces, with more expensive prosthetics that are decorated with unique customizations or designs available for a corresponding mark-up. For more information on prosthetics, see page 69 of Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar. The sterling dynamo prosthetic technology presented here was created through collaboration between a Dongun Hold prosthesis inventor, who created the flexible silvery clockwork joint system, and a researcher from the Clockwork Cathedral in Absalom, who created a prototype variant that increased how customizable the model was and sent it back to the dwarven inventor to iterate further. That iteration became the sterling dynamo that entered the market in late 4721 AR. It has been widely applauded for its adaptability in both combat and everyday use.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Sterling Dynamo Dedication]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<hr />\n<p>You obtain a sterling dynamo prosthetic, which allows you to replace or augment a limb, or even add a simple new non-prehensile limb, such as a tail. While your sterling dynamo prosthetic can replace a missing prehensile limb, such as an arm, choosing to add a new limb can never increases your character's number of hands or prehensile limbs beyond two, even in combination with other abilities or effects.</p>\n<p>Your sterling dynamo prosthesis is especially optimized for combat, granting you a dynamo melee unarmed attack that is in the brawling weapon group and is made of silver (which makes it more effective against certain types of creatures, such as devils and werewolves).</p>\n<p>You have several options to customize your sterling dynamo. First, choose whether you have a power driver dynamo, which deals [[/r 1d6[bludgeoning]]] damage and has the shove trait, or a percussive striker dynamo, which deals [[/r 1d4[bludgeoning]]] damage and has the agile and finesse traits. Most dynamos are automated, so they don't require a free hand to use, like other unarmed attacks. However, you can instead choose to make your dynamo be manually controlled via a handheld switch, lever, or other device; to make an attack with a manually controlled dynamo, you must have a hand free to operate it, but the benefit is great control and a more devastating strike. This increases the damage die by one size, to a 1d8 for a power drive dynamo or 1d6 for a percussive striker dynamo. Arm dynamos are always manual, but they use the hand on that arm to operate the dynamo when making strikes. Manual control is required only in the heat of combat, not for less strenuous adventuring or everyday activities.</p>\n<p>You need to keep your sterling dynamo wound, but the process isn't particularly onerous, so in most situations, it won't be an issue. If you spend 1 minute winding up your dynamo, it can remain active for 24 hours before needing additional winding. However, enemies can attempt to Disable the dynamo, which has a level equal to your own, to reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour, or 2 hours on a critical success. Certain other abilities that adversely affect technology might also reduce the dynamo's remaining operational time. When your dynamo is out of operational time, you can still use it as a normal prosthetic, but you cannot use your dynamo unarmed attack or any other abilities from this archetype until you wind the dynamo again. You can wind the dynamo for 1 minute at any time to return it to the maximum 24 hours of operational time.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the sterling dynamo archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Modular Dynamo]{Modular Dynamo} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Sterling Dynamo Dedication]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your dynamo has modular configurations, allowing you to swap between various different possibilities with ease in order to adapt to various situations in combat. Your dynamo attack gains the modular trait, as well as one of the following configurations of your choice: power driver ([[/r 1d6[bludgeoning]]] damage; shove), percussive striker ([[/r 1d4[bludgeoning]]] damage; agile, finesse), rotating sickle ([[/r 1d6[slashing]]] damage; trip), or entangling barbs ([[/r 1d6[piercing]]] damage; grapple). If you have a manually controlled dynamo, these damage dice increase by 1 size, as usual, and you can also choose the extendable baton ([[/r 1d4[bludgeoning]]] damage; finesse, reach), which has the damage increase already factored in.</p>\n<p>When you use an Interact action to switch configurations using the modular trait, you switch between the initial configuration of dynamo you chose with the Sterling Dynamo Dedication and the new configuration you chose with Modular Dynamo.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, you choose another configuration and add it to the list of options you can choose when you use an Interact action with the modular trait.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Piston Punch]{Piston Punch} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Sterling Dynamo Dedication]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You lash out with a powerful punch, extending your dynamo to a greater length in order to attack two creatures in a row. Make a single bludgeoning or piercing dynamo Strike and compare the attack roll result to the ACs of up to two foes. The first foe must be within your melee reach and the second foe must be adjacent to the first foe in a straight line away from you. Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature you hit. A Piston Punch counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty. Reduce the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Stasian Smash]{Stasian Smash} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Sterling Dynamo Dedication]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication}</p>\n<p><strong>Access</strong> You are from Ustalav.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've modified your dynamo with Stasian coils, allowing you to make a powerful attack that crackles with electricity. Make a dynamo Strike. On a success, the Strike deals an additional [[/r 1d12[electricity]]] damage to the target, as well as [[/r 1d4[electricity]]] damage to up to two other foes within 10 feet as sparks leap across the gaps. If you critically fail your dynamo Strike, you take [[/r 1d12[electricity]]] damage. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. At 18th level, the additional electricity damage to the target increases to 2d12, and the additional electricity damage to the other foes increases to [[/r 2d4]]{2d4}. Reduce the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Beast Dynamo Howl]{Beast Dynamo Howl} Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Sterling Dynamo Dedication]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication}</p>\n<p><strong>Access</strong> You are from Arcadia.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've incorporated beast tech from Arcadia into your dynamo, adding in components from various terrifying creatures to enhance your prosthesis's capabilities. The beast parts can unleash a disturbing howl as you make a powerful attack with your dynamo. Attempt a single Intimidation check to Demoralize each enemy within 30 feet; you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language. Then, make a dynamo Strike. Reduce the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Golem Dynamo]{Golem Dynamo} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Sterling Dynamo Dedication]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication}</p>\n<p><strong>Access</strong> You are an automaton or are otherwise from the ancient Jistka Imperium.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned the secrets of Jistkan golem prostheses, allowing you to incorporate golem components into your dynamo and gain a portion of their magic. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against magic, and your dynamo Strikes become magical.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Soaring Dynamo]{Soaring Dynamo} Feat 18</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Sterling Dynamo Dedication]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've built clockwork wings or jets into your dynamo, allowing you to use your prosthesis to fly. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. Each minute of flight reduces the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour, measured from the first time you use the Fly action in a given minute.</p>",

But magic is so much more than that-it is thought, will, and action, and with the right talismans, you can make even the cut of a sword a deeply magical act. This all hinges on the small magical talismans you affix to your gear. You know how to make and use the perfect talismans for any job.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Talisman Dabbler Dedication]{Talisman Dabbler Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p>You are trained in the use of talismans and similar magical paraphernalia. This training might have occurred in a formal classroom or been an agglomeration of folk magic picked up over time. You can craft talismans and know the formulas for all common talismans in the Core Rulebook of your level or lower. You remember talisman formulas and don't need a formula book for them.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you carry a collection of magical baubles you can turn into temporary talismans. Each day during your daily preparations, you can make two talismans with an item level no higher than half your level. You must know each talisman's formula. A talisman created this way is a temporary item and loses its magic the next time you make your daily preparations if you haven't already used it.</p>\n<p>Finally, when you Affix a Talisman, you can (in any combination) affix or remove up to four talismans in the 10-minute span.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Talisman Dabbler archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Quick Fix]{Quick Fix} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Talisman Dabbler Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can attach a talisman using only a bit of glue and some string.

If you ever have more than one undead companion, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Call Companion]{Call Companion} action, with your undead companions taking the place of animal companions.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the undead master archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Guardian Ghosts]{Guardian Ghosts} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Undead Master Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per 10 minutes</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You would take damage from a Strike while one of your undead companions is adjacent to you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You magically divert some of the harm from an incoming attack away from yourself, forcing your undead companion to take it in your stead. Reduce the damage you take from the triggering Strike by 2 + your level. Your adjacent undead companion loses a number of Hit Points equal to the amount of damage reduced. If you have more than one adjacent undead companion, you choose which one loses Hit Points. You can't divert the damage to a temporary fragment from Their Master's Call.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Their Master's Call]{Their Master's Call} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Undead Master Dedication, Call Companion, at least one inactive undead companion whose remains or anchor are currently in your possession.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In a pinch, you pull one of your inactive companions from their rest to provide a companion's support benefit. A fragment of your companion materializes or assembles itself in an unoccupied square of your choice within 30 feet of you, grants you its support benefit, and then disappears on your next turn. If it takes any damage before your next turn, it disappears or collapses (as applicable) and the support benefit ends immediately.</p>",

Many adventurers are skilled at dispatching undead, but you go a step further. You study them, learn their weaknesses, and master the tools to end them quickly and cleanly. An undead slayer doesn't simply kill monsters; they become what even monsters fear. Leave it to others to be a shield-you become the blade that strikes evil at its heart. You can identify the common types of undead by sight. You drill and practice with the special gear necessary to destroy some of the more complicated undead, like vampires; train in their strengths and weaknesses; and learn how to create safe houses to stash your arsenal and hide from undead.</p>\n<p>Some undead slayers work at the behest of an organization to exterminate the undead of a particular region, but many act independently, or in a group of like‑minded adventurers. Were you called by a higher power? Are you on a personal quest for vengeance?

The sanctum is roughly the size of a 20-foot cube. This sanctum is in a location you have access to and can be part of a larger structure, such as the basement of a temple or hidden room of a library. Setting up or moving your sanctum takes a week of downtime. Your sanctum protects objects and people inside it from magical detection and the prying eyes of undead. This has the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Nondetection]{Nondetection}</em>, using your Religion modifier for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the counteract level. Additionally, undead attempting to locate the entrance to your sanctum via mundane Perception must succeed against either your Religion DC or the normal DC to find the sanctum, whichever is higher.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Necromantic Resistance]{Necromantic Resistance} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Undead Slayer Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As part of your training, you've inured yourself against necromancy through grueling, repeated exposure.

Make a Strike against a creature you know is undead. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If this Strike hits, you deal one extra die of positive damage, with the same die size as the weapon or unarmed attack you used. Any further Strikes you make against the same creature before the start of your next turn using the same weapon or unarmed attack deal extra positive damage equal to the number of weapon dice. As normal, the positive damage harms only undead and creatures with negative healing.</p>\n<p>If you're at least 10th level, increase this to two extra dice, and if you're at least 18th level, increase it to three extra dice.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Frighten Undead]{Frighten Undead} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Undead Slayer Dedication, trained in Intimidation</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your very presence chills creatures of the night down to their core and you can use the spiritual power and faithful life force of religious verses to frighten even mindless undead.

Your character at first seems like they bumble into their successes through sheer circumstance. However, when the circumstances pile up, others might start to suspect another possibility: perhaps your character is secretly so incredible that they not only achieve impressive results but do so in a way that hides their skill behind a veneer of lucky breaks. Ultimately, either could be true about your character, or some combination of both. You might decide the truth together with the GM as soon as you take this archetype or hold off until later to make that call. Because this archetype hints at hidden talent intentionally obfuscated, it offers a good choice for a character who's secretly more powerful or skilled than they seem or who must hide their abilities for some reason-perhaps associated with the plot of the campaign.</p>\n<p>If your inclination is to play a character who hides their abilities, consider training in the Deception skill and taking skill feats like Charming Liar and Confabulator that emphasize your character's crafty nature and skill at concealing their true intent.</p>\n<p>If you instead prefer to play a character who's legitimately a bit uncoordinated but abnormally lucky, you might choose to pursue actions that have a high chance of earning you a Hero Point.

If you hit the second target, attempt to Strike a third target within 30 feet of the second target, and so on, continuing until you miss a target. You can cease the chain at any point; otherwise, it ends when you first miss an attack. However, you can't target the same creature more than once; each time you move to a new target, it must be a target you haven't made a Strike against yet during this particular use of Chain Reaction.</p>\n<p>This damage is caused by some improbable set of events that injures one target after another, rather than from actually making several shots. Perhaps you shot at a tree branch that then fell on the targets, or one target's scream caused another to accidentally set off their gun and shoot themselves in the foot. This means that only the first target suffers any special effects tied to the bullet (if it was magical ammunition, for example), but each target you hit still takes the same damage dealt by your Strike. Normally, all damage is of the same damage type as the initial bullet. However, the GM might choose to change the damage type based on their description of the chain reaction. For example, if one target was burned by fire, that target might take fire damage instead of physical damage.</p>",

While you can make a great profit working on custom vehicles for wealthy clients, you still keep a vehicle of your own to tinker with as your personal passion project.</p>\n<p>You might be part of a vehicle mechanic union, working with other mechanics and engineers to find fair jobs and support each other's labor. While some vehicle mechanic unions are secular, many realize the benefits of organizing alongside a sympathetic religion, and so they typically adopt the ideals of economically-focused gods like Abadar or deities interested in crafting such as the goddess Brigh—the Whisper in Bronze—the goddess of invention. Whether religious or secular, vehicle mechanic unions take the bonds between fellow union members seriously.

As in most other such trades, some vehicle mechanics form unions to keep business practices fair and to protect each other from predatory employers. The Absalom Shipwright's Union is the largest union for vehicle mechanics in Absalom, with over a thousand builders, carpenters, and engineers among its membership. Almenia Oarstone (LG female dwarf shipwright) is the current leader of the union, having been a member for more than 60 years. It is said that you can count on one hand the number of ships that have docked in Absalom on which she has never worked.

In this way, the vehicle mechanic archetype pairs excellently with a PC who has chosen the trick driver archetype. Vehicles are an element you should consider carefully before deciding to include, even in a guns and gears campaign. Vehicles are relatively complicated and can move very fast, which may make mapping encounters quite difficult. They can also move characters too far from the fight for other participants to respond.

                "content": "<p>As a vigilante, you have two faces: a public persona, and a secret identity that lets you hide your extralegal actions from polite society. Your secret identity lets you adventure and carry out clandestine missions while keeping the civilians you care about safe. Whatever your purpose- fighting crime, inciting rebellion, sowing chaos-your vigilante identity makes you both hard to pin down and a mysterious, intriguing subject of gossip.</p>\n<p>Additional Feats: 4th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Quick Draw]{Quick Draw}</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Vigilante Dedication]{Vigilante Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Deception</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have two identities, each with its own name, alignment, and abilities. Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these people, and as such, your two identities can be at most one alignment step from each other (for instance, you could be neutral in one identity and neutral evil in the other, but not chaotic evil in the other). If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they must use a Seek action to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC, as if you were using the Impersonate action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC. Unlike with Impersonate, you don't have to attempt a Deception check to interact with someone to conceal your other identity-a check happens only if someone else specifically tries to uncover your other identity.</p>\n<p>Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don't reduce the time required to change identities.</p>\n<p>Your two identities are completely distinct. You have your current identity's alignment for effects that rely on alignment, though you are eligible for abilities that require a certain alignment (such as a cleric's deity) only if both of your identities qualify. Checks to Recall Knowledge about one of your identities don't reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the check knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity, such as the detect alignment spell, work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn't exist.</p>\n<p>To maintain the separation between your identities, some of your abilities have one of two traits: social or vigilante. You can use social feats only while in your social identity. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity risks exposing you as a vigilante. This means that if you were particularly meek or inconspicuous before you took this feat, your identity could be at greater risk of exposure. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can otherwise use both social and vigilante abilities in either identity unless they rely on your identity being a secret. You can use feats that don't have either trait regardless of your current identity.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Vigilante archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Hidden Magic]{Hidden Magic} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion; Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned to hide the magical auras of your gear. During your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your magic items to appear non-magical. Objects adjusted in this way remain so until your next preparations. A spellcaster using detect magic or read aura must succeed at a Perception check against your Deception DC to see through your obfuscations.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Minion Guise]{Minion Guise} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> animal companion or familiar, expert in Deception, Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you are in your social identity, you can also grant a social identity to an animal companion, familiar, or other minion you gained from a class feature. When changing to your social identity, you also change your minion's appearance to that of a socially acceptable creature of its type, such as grooming a wolf to appear as a large dog or disguising a familiar to appear as an exotic pet. Commanding your minion to use unusual magical or combat abilities it gained from your class features or feats while in this social identity risks exposing your vigilante identity.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Safe House]{Safe House} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You establish a safe house-a secure space in which to hide your secrets from the outside world. This safe house is roughly the size of a 10-foot cube. It's in a location you have access to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a hidden room or an underground cave. The safe house protects objects and people inside it from magical detection. This has the effects of nondetection, using your Deception modifier for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the counteract level. Setting up or moving your safe house takes a week of downtime. The size of the safe house expands to four 10-foot cubes if you're an expert in Deception, eight cubes if you're a master, and 16 cubes if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Social Purview]{Social Purview} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have built a reputation for yourself in your social identity. Choose one archetype that you meet the prerequisites for. You gain that archetype's dedication feat and can select feats from that archetype, even if you haven't yet gained enough feats in the vigilante archetype to take another dedication feat. These feats become part of your social identity and gain the social trait-for instance, a fighter vigilante could take the wizard dedication feat and have a wizard social identity. Using these feats in your social identity doesn't risk exposing your vigilante identity, but using them in your vigilante identity could put you at risk for exposure.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Startling Appearance (Vigilante)]{Startling Appearance} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are completely unnoticed by the target creature.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can startle foes who are unaware of your presence. Make a Strike against your target. That creature is flat-footed against this Strike, as normal. If your Strike hits, the target remains flat-footed for the rest of your turn and is frightened 1 (frightened 2 on a critical hit).</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Quick Change]{Quick Change} Feat 7</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in Deception, Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can shift between your identities with ease. Instead of spending 1 minute to change your identity, you can now do so as a 3-action activity. If you are legendary in Deception, you can perform this change as a 1-action activity.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Subjective Truth]{Subjective Truth} Feat 7</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in Deception, Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your disparate identities allow you to defeat magic that detects lies. As long as what you say is true from the point of view of your current identity, you can say it even under effects like zone of truth that force you to speak the truth.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Many Guises]{Many Guises} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in Deception, Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever you change your identity, instead of taking on your social or vigilante identity, you can become someone completely ordinary. This identity isn't a specific individual-rather, you become a nondescript member of your ancestry, of any gender, with a neutral alignment and a mundane occupation such as common laborer, farmer, or peasant. Spells and abilities detect you as if you were this ordinary identity, rather than either of your two real identities, unless they succeed at a counteract check against your Deception DC. You can't use either social abilities or vigilante abilities while in this identity.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Frightening Appearance]{Frightening Appearance} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Intimidation, Startling Appearance</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your dramatic appearances can frighten bystanders. When you make a Startling Appearance, you can also attempt to Demoralize each opponent within 10 feet to whom you were unnoticed before your Strike.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Stunning Appearance]{Stunning Appearance} Feat 16</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Startling Appearance</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your sudden appearance leaves your foe unable to respond. When you use Startling Appearance, if your foe's level is equal to or lower than yours, they are also stunned 1 on a hit, or stunned 2 on a critical hit.</p>",

Specializing in a variety of grabs, holds, and strikes, wrestlers are dangerous opponents whose techniques can leave a foe broken and defeated without taking their life.</p>\n<p>The wrestling tradition is common all over Golarion. Gladiators and other warriors who fight for entertainment use wrestling techniques in combat. The discipline's focus on grappling is also useful in non-gladiatorial matches, as many foes are unable to contend with an opponent's hold. Grappling is particularly effective against spellcasters, who have a difficult time completing the somatic components of their spells while grabbed.</p>\n<p>Wrestlers have storied traditions in the Hold of Belkzen, where orcs use specialized grappling techniques to subdue the large animals they ride as mounts. Orcs prefer wrestling these creatures partially to minimize harm to them, but also because they believe that the process of subduing the creature creates a stronger bond between mount and rider.</p>\n<p>Outside of the Inner Sea, wrestlers are common in Iblydos and Arcadia. Iblydan wrestlers focus on grappling techniques to make sure they're never left without a means to fight on the battlefield, even if their weapons are destroyed. Arcadian wrestlers engage in matches designed to retell stories of ancient gods. These matches feature impressive acrobatic feats as well as highly technical grappling maneuvers.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Wrestler Dedication]{Wrestler Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Athletics, unarmed attacks, and unarmored defense</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your training in the wrestling arts has made you particularly adept at moving, striking, and grappling while unencumbered.

Becoming a living mummy - one capable of both motion and thought - is another thing altogether.</p><p>Most of those forced into undeath as mummies are bound to tombs, temples, and vaults as guardians. Some willingly undergo the process, embracing death to live beyond it. These willing mummies become the most powerful of their kind, rising above their brethren like an emperor above their subjects.</p><p>The horrifically painful living mummification process must be performed by others - usually a team of well-trained necromancers, priests, or ritualists - upon a still-living subject. Death by mummification is gruesome, but to be kept alive for as long as possible throughout the process is a thousandfold worse. The process usually takes weeks, beginning with forced starvation, followed by the consumption of spices and tonics that desiccate the subject's internal organs.</p><p>Very rarely, mummies are created by natural processes occurring in locations that are cursed or inundated by negative energy. These mummies most often rise in deserts, bogs, swamps, at high altitudes, or in frigid locales. Although the process through which they are created is less painful and far shorter in duration, the spiritual shift from living to undead is no less traumatizing.</p><p>Mummies are most commonly found in Geb and Osirion, as well as the surrounding nations of Thuvia, Katapesh, and Qadira. They have a foothold in the Gravelands, the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, and the Mwangi Expanse, particularly around Mzali.

Few vessels can fully dictate the terms of the arrangement, but the fact that you give the entity a corporeal form does give you some amount of leverage. Use it wisely.</p><p><strong>Additional Feats:</strong> Your GM might determine that you can take a pact feat from the pactbinder archetype as an additional feat, as long as the pact is made to the entity within you. For instance, if you're hosting a fey, you could make a pact involving fey. These pact feats are at the same level as for a pactbinder.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Living Vessel Dedication]{Living Vessel Dedication} Feat 2</h2><p>Whether willingly or not, you've become a vessel for a being of unimaginable power. You and your GM should work together to determine the being's nature and decide how much you know and how much remains a mystery to you for now. Some decisions might influence your options later. You might need to decide whether the entity is a demon, for instance, to know if you qualify for later feats.</p><p>You need to spend at least an hour each day assuaging the entity within you or you take a -1 penalty to Will saves for 24 hours. The process of assuaging the entity is determined together between you and the GM. It might be as simple as meditating with the entity to learn more about them, but it might be as extreme as committing gruesome, unspeakable sacrifices to keep their unknowable blessings. After a full week of failing to assuage your entity, you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Doomed]{Doomed 1}, and you can't remove or ameliorate the condition until you allow your entity to take full possession of your body for 24 hours, during which time it pursues its own agenda.</p><p>You also gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Entity's Resurgence]{Entity's Resurgence} reaction, allowing you to unleash your entity in lieu of falling @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Unconscious]{Unconscious}, though at the risk of letting it enact its will.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the living vessel archetype.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Entity's Strike]{Entity's Strike} Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Living Vessel Dedication</p><hr /><p>The more you try to force your body to stay yours, the more it warps to channel the energy flowing through you.

You gain an unarmed attack of your choice with its type determined by your entity. It deals 1d6 damage of a damage type appropriate for the unarmed attack (such as bludgeoning for the tentacle).

Perhaps an ancient being of nightmare demanded to consume something you sought to be rid of, like a painful memory or a negative personality trait, priding itself on how it was taking something personal from you. Little did it know, you let it win on haggling your end of the deal. Of course, this practice isn't without its own risks, as who knows what you might become without that part of you.</p><p>All these things, you can and must consider in every pact. In addition to pacts, you might also pursue magical contracts. While less of a metaphysical commitment than a pact, contracts offer similar benefits you just can't resist— and you can employ your skill set as a pactbinder to manipulate the precise wording of the bargain.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Pactbinder Dedication]{Pactbinder Dedication} Feat 2</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Diplomacy as well as either Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion</p><hr /><p>The first step toward forming a successful pact is an understanding of the magic behind it, along with skill at negotiation. It doesn't hurt that you also learned how to magically bind yourself to keep your word, enabling you to bargain more easily. You increase your proficiency from trained to expert in Diplomacy and in one of the following: Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Binding Vow]{Binding Vow}</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the pactbinder archetype.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Pact of Fey Glamour]{Pact of Fey Glamour} Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Pactbinder Dedication</p><hr /><p>You've sworn a pact with fey powers, granting you the otherworldly appearance of your dreams in exchange for oaths of hospitality. As long as you keep your end of the bargain, your base appearance changes indefinitely to any one appearance you wish that's within the bounds of possibility for your ancestry; this effect can't be counteracted or removed except by violating the pact. Additionally, you can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Illusory Disguise]{Illusory Disguise}</em> as a primal innate spell once per hour, using the higher of your class DC and your spell DC to determine the DC.</p><p>In exchange, you promise to accept any fey's request for hospitality, granting them food, drink, and lodging for up to 3 days and 3 nights. You also promise not to harm any creature to whom you've offered hospitality or who has shown hospitality to you, whether or not that creature is fey, unless that creature does harm first. If you refuse hospitality to a fey or violate hospitality, you lose the benefits of this feat until you atone for your transgressions, instantly reverting your appearance to the one you had before the pact.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Sociable Vow]{Sociable Vow} Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Pactbinder Dedication; expert in Diplomacy</p><hr /><p>You can leverage your vow in more social interactions. The circumstance bonus from your Binding Vow also applies to attempts to Gather Information, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Make an Impression]{Make an Impression}, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Demoralize]{Demoralize} you make directly in service of fulfilling the vow.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Pact of Draconic Fury]{Pact of Draconic Fury} Feat 6</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Pactbinder Dedication</p><hr /><p>You've sworn a pact with a dragon, giving you the ability to tap into the dragon's immeasurable power in exchange for adding to their hoard. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Dragon Breath]{Dragon Breath} activity. In exchange, you promise to search for objects the dragon wants for its hoard upon request. These requests might be extremely specific unique objects, or they might be a broad category of objects. While the dragon agrees to pay you a fair price for the item you retrieve, the pact requires you to give your time and service.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Pact of Infernal Prowess]{Pact of Infernal Prowess} Feat 8</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Pactbinder Dedication</p><hr /><p>You've sworn a pact with devils, granting you success in life in exchange for your soul in the afterlife. Once per hour, when you critically fail a check, you can reroll the check as a free action; this is a fortune effect. Additionally, you can choose to automatically succeed at checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Earn Income]{Earn Income} for tasks below your level, without rolling. However, when you die, your soul is consigned to Hell. You can't be returned to life except by powerful magic such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Miracle]{Miracle}</em>, and even then, the devils responsible for the contract can track your every move for 1 year. The devils gain the effects of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Discern Location]{Discern Location}</em> spell. They can also use 10th-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Scrying]{Scrying}</em> on you at will, and you automatically critically fail your saving throw.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> You can't retrain out of a Pact of Infernal Prowess without journeying to Hell and destroying the devil's written contract spelling out the terms of your pact.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Pact of the Final Breath]{Pact of the Final Breath} Feat 12</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Pactbinder Dedication</p><hr /><p>You've sworn a pact with a powerful psychopomp-typically an olethros advocate or yamaraj judge-granting you a reprieve before your soul will be collected in exchange for respect for the dead and assistance against the undead. As long as you keep your end of the bargain, you live twice as long as you normally would before dying of natural causes. Additionally, the first time each day that you would be reduced to 0 Hit Points and gain the dying condition, you instead regain a number of Hit Points equal to twice your level (starting from 0 HP), remain conscious, and gain fast healing equal to your level for 3 rounds.</p><p>In exchange, you swear to treat the dead you come across with respect, performing last rites and final dispositions to ensure their spirits rest in peace and are less likely to rise as undead. Furthermore, you swear to destroy undead you come across, so long as it's within your power to do so without inordinate risk to yourself. Violating your part of the pact causes its protections to immediately end. If at that point you had already lived beyond your natural lifespan, the psychopomps typically give you a few moments to make any last farewells, and then you simply breathe your final breath and pass on.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Pact of Eldritch Eyes]{Pact of Eldritch Eyes} Feat 14</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Pactbinder Dedication</p><hr /><p>You've sworn a pact with an entity beyond mortal comprehension, granting you distant visions and insights. You can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Prying Eye]{Prying Eye}</em> as an occult innate spell once per hour, using the higher of your class DC and your spell DC to determine the DC.</p><p>In exchange, you allow the entity to peer through you at your world. The entity's touch creates strange dreams, typically nightmares. Every morning, you awaken trained in an unexpected Lore skill determined by the GM, which you retain until the next time you rest for the night. While the entity contacts you most often while you sleep, it occasionally peers at you during the day, leading to disorientation and visions. You can generally determine what's going on during these visions, so normally this occurrence imparts no mechanical penalty. However, in the unlikely event that an encounter begins while you're experiencing visions from the entity, you might take a circumstance penalty to your initiative roll.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> The entity isn't particularly attached to its pact with you. If you want it gone, you can retrain out of Pact of Eldritch Eyes, after which the entity withdraws its eyes to the void.</p>",

While in the target's dream, you witness its contents, plots, and emotional experiences as an observer, though nothing within the dream can perceive or interact with you. Your target becomes temporarily immune to Infiltrate Dream for 1 week. You can't enter the dreams of a creature that doesn't have a conscious mind or doesn't dream.</p><p>While within the dream, you can attempt an Occultism check against the target's Will DC to interpret symbolism and learn information about a single topic.

If your next action is to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Cast a Spell]{Cast a Spell} that summons a creature, that creature is another version of you. This creature remains the type of creature you summoned and has largely the same abilities (plus the following adjustments), but it clearly resembles you, likely sharing some distinguishing features, such as mannerisms, speech patterns, tattoos, or clothing. The summoned creature gains a +1 status bonus to any skill check in which you're trained, a +2 status bonus if you're an expert, a +3 status bonus if you're a master, or a +4 status bonus if you're legendary. The creature also takes a -2 penalty to all skills in which you're untrained.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Into the Future]{Into the Future} Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Time Mage Dedication</p><hr /><p>You know your spell will be needed not now but in a few moments, so you cast your magic into the future. If your next action is to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Cast a Spell]{Cast a Spell} that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast, the spell's effects occur 1 round later, at the beginning of your next turn, rather than immediately. Targets and choices about the spell must be determined when the spell is cast, and requirements, such as line of sight and line of effect, must be valid both when the spell is cast and when its effects occur. Consequences for the action of Casting the Spell itself, such as an Attack of Opportunity reaction or ending a foe's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Fascinated]{Fascinated} condition by taking a hostile action, aren't delayed.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Purge of Moments]{Purge of Moments} Feat 16</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Time Mage Dedication</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p><hr /><p>All things eventually end, a truth that you can put into practice by accelerating your passage through time to shake off harmful effects. Five rounds of apparent time occur for you. No one, including you, can act during this time, but effects on you run their course, including beneficial effects, negative effects, afflictions, conditions, and persistent damage. Roll saving throws, flat checks, damage, and any other rolls for those effects normally as if the time had passed. Excessive use of this technique is responsible for more than a few premature gray hairs among time mages.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Timeline-Splitting Spell]{Timeline-Splitting Spell} Feat 18</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Time Mage Dedication</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><hr /><p>You invest in two futures, then choose the one to make a reality. You Cast two Spells that each take 1 or 2 actions to cast. These can't be the same spell heightened to two different levels. You expend the resources for both spells, such as spell slots, Focus Points, and material components. Determine the immediate results for both spells, including attack rolls, saving throws, damage, and any other dice rolls. Then, choose which of the two spells takes effect, using the previously made rolls. The other spell's resources are still expended, but the spell has no effect as the magic disappears the other timeline.</p>",

Your body continues to rot and putrefy, and the stench is ever present. Your old self keeps slipping away, more and more as the weeks pass by.

Your memory's not perfect, and although you haven't noticed any huge gaps or flaws yet, you have a feeling they're there somewhere.</p><p>Unlike your other senses, your hunger has intensified. You ceaselessly crave the raw flesh and brains of the living—the smarter the better—and satisfying this hunger is the only thing that makes you feel alive.
