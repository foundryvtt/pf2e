You might need to give out treasure you hadn't originally planned for, especially if the group bypasses part of an adventure. Keep an eye on the party's resources. If they're running out of consumables or money, or if they're having trouble in combat because their items aren't up to the task, you can make adjustments.</p><p>This is especially common in adventures that have little downtime or that take place far from civilization. If the group goes a long time without being able to purchase or Craft useful items, the PCs will be flush with coins and valuables but behind on useful equipment. In a situation like this, you can either place more useful treasure in the adventure or introduce NPCs who are willing to trade.</p>\n<h3>Megadungeons and Sandboxes</h3>\n<p>Some adventures have an expectation that the player characters explore where they want and find only what their skill, luck, and ingenuity afford. Two common examples of this type of adventure are the sprawling dungeon with multiple different sections and paths, often called a megadungeon, and free-form exploration, often called a sandbox and typically occurring in a wilderness. If you want to build a free-form adventure like this where characters are likely to miss at least some of the treasure, increase the amount of treasure you place. Be aware, however, that a meticulous group can end up with more treasure than normal and will have advantages in later adventures.</p><p>For a simple guideline to these situations, increase the treasure as though there were one more PC in the party. If the structure is especially loose, especially in sandbox adventures, you can increase this amount even further.</p>",

In these cases, refer to the table above, which shows how many common permanent items of various levels the PC should have, in addition to currency. A single item on this table is always a baseline item. If the player wants armor or a weapon with property runes, they must buy the property runes separately, and for armor or a weapon made of a precious material, they must pay for the precious material separately as well.</p><p>These values are for a PC just starting out at the given level. If the PC is joining a party that has already made progress toward the next level, consider giving the new character an additional item of their current level. If your party has kept the treasure of dead or retired PCs and passed it on to new characters, you might need to give the new character less than the values on the table or reduce some of the treasure rewards of the next few adventures.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Item Selection</h2>\n<p>You should work with the new character's player to decide which items their character has. Allow the player to make suggestions, and if they know what items they want their character to have, respect their choices unless you believe those choices will have a negative impact on your game. At your discretion, you can grant the player character uncommon or rare items that fit their backstory and concept, keeping in mind how many items of those rarities you have introduced into your game. The player can also spend currency on consumables or lower-level permanent items, keeping the rest as coinage. As usual, you determine which items the character can find for purchase.</p><p>A PC can voluntarily choose an item that has a lower level than any or all of the listed items, but they don't gain any more currency by doing so.</p><p>If you choose, you can allow the player to instead start with a lump sum of currency and buy whatever common items they want, with a maximum item level of 1 lower than the character's level. This has a lower total value than the normal allotment of permanent items and currency, since the player can select a higher ratio of high-level items.</p>",

Standard cover gives you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, to Reflex saves against area effects, and to Stealth checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Hide]{Hide}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Sneak]{Sneak}, or otherwise avoid detection. You can increase this to greater cover using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Take Cover]{Take Cover} basic action, increasing the circumstance bonus to +4. If cover is especially light, typically when it's provided by a creature, you have lesser cover, which grants a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. A creature with standard cover or greater cover can attempt to use Stealth to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Hide]{Hide}, but lesser cover isn't sufficient.</p>\n<p>Cover is relative, so you might simultaneously have cover against one creature and not another. Cover applies only if your path to the target is partially blocked. If a creature is entirely behind a wall or the like, you don't have line of effect and typically can't target it at all.</p>\n<p>Usually, the GM can quickly decide whether your target has cover. If you're uncertain or need to be more precise, draw a line from the center of your space to the center of the target's space. If that line passes through any terrain or object that would block the effect, the target has standard cover (or greater cover if the obstruction is extreme or the target has Taken Cover). If the line passes through a creature instead, the target has lesser cover. When measuring cover against an area effect, draw the line from the effect's point of origin to the center of the creature's space.</p>\n<h2>Cover and Large Creatures</h2>\n<p>If a creature between you and a target is two or more sizes larger than both you and your target, that creature's space blocks the effect enough to provide standard cover instead of lesser cover. The GM might determine that a creature doesn't gain cover from terrain that it's significantly larger than. For example, a Huge dragon probably wouldn't receive any benefit from being behind a 1-foot-wide pillar.</p>\n<h2>Special Circumstances</h2>\n<p>Your GM might allow you to overcome your target's cover in some situations. If you're right next to an arrow slit, you can shoot without penalty, but you have greater cover against someone shooting back at you from far away. Your GM might let you reduce or negate cover by leaning around a corner to shoot or the like. This usually takes an action to set up, and the GM might measure cover from an edge or corner of your space instead of your center.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4><strong>Sidebar(s) </strong>@UUID[.ok2IPQGIrxj8h1vs]{Three-Dimensional Combat}</h4>\n</section>",

Your maximum Hit Point value represents your health, wherewithal, and heroic drive when you are in good health and rested. Your maximum Hit Points include the Hit Points you gain at 1st level from your ancestry and class, those you gain at higher levels from your class, and any you gain from other sources (like the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Toughness]{Toughness}general feat). When you take damage, you reduce your current Hit Points by a number equal to the damage dealt.</p>\n<p>Some spells, items, and other effects, as well as simply resting, can heal living or undead creatures. When you are healed, you regain Hit Points equal to the amount healed, up to your maximum Hit Points.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Knocked Out and Dying</h2>\n<p>Creatures cannot be reduced to fewer than 0 Hit Points. When most creatures reach 0 Hit Points, they die and are removed from play unless the attack was nonlethal, in which case they are instead knocked out for a significant amount of time (usually 1 minute or more). When undead and construct creatures reach 0 Hit Points, they are destroyed.</p>\n<p>Player characters, their companions, and other significant characters and creatures don't automatically die when they reach 0 Hit Points. Instead, they are knocked out and are at risk of death. At the GM's discretion, villains, powerful monsters, special NPCs, and enemies with special abilities that are likely to bring them back to the fight (like ferocity, regeneration, or healing magic) can use these rules as well.</p>\n<p>As a player character, when you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, you're knocked out with the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You immediately move your initiative position to directly before the turn in which you were reduced to 0 HP.</li>\n<li>You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Dying]{Dying 1} condition. If the effect that knocked you out was a critical success from the attacker or the result of your critical failure, you gain the dying 2 condition instead. If you have the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Wounded]{Wounded} condition, increase your dying value by an amount equal to your wounded value. If the damage was dealt by a nonlethal attack or nonlethal effect, you don't gain the dying condition; you are instead @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Unconscious]{Unconscious} with 0 Hit Points.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Taking Damage while Dying</h2>\n<p>If you take damage while you already have the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Dying]{Dying} condition, increase your dying condition value by 1, or by 2 if the damage came from an attacker's critical hit or your own critical failure. If you have the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Wounded]{Wounded} condition, remember to add the value of your wounded condition to your dying value.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Recovery Checks</h2>\n<p>When you're dying, at the start of each of your turns, you must attempt a flat check with a DC equal to 10 + your current dying value to see if you get better or worse. This is called a recovery check. The effects of this check are asfollows.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Your dying value is reduced by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Your dying value is reduced by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> Your dying value increases by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your dying value increases by 2.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Conditions Related to Death and Dying</h2>\n<p>To understand the rules for getting knocked out and how dying works in the game, you'll need some more information on the conditions used in those rules. Presented below are the rules for the dying, unconscious, wounded, and doomed conditions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Dying</h3>\n<p>You are bleeding out or otherwise at death's door. While you have this condition, you are unconscious. Dying always includes a value. If this value ever reaches dying 4, you die. If you're dying, you must attempt a recovery check at the start of your turn each round to determine whether you get better or worse.</p>\n<p>If you lose the dying condition by succeeding at a recovery check and are still at 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious, but you can wake up as described on page 460. You lose the dying condition automatically and wake up if you ever have 1 Hit Point or more. Anytime you lose the dying condition, you gain the wounded 1 condition, or increase your wounded value by 1 if you already have that condition.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Unconscious</h3>\n<p>You're sleeping, or you've been knocked out. You can't act. You take a -4 status penalty to AC, Perception, and Reflex saves, and you have the blinded and flat-footed conditions. When you gain this condition, you fall prone and drop items you are wielding or holding unless the effect states otherwise or the GM determines you're in a position in which you wouldn't.</p>\n<p><strong>If you're unconscious because you're dying</strong>, you can't wake up as long as you have 0 Hit Points. If you're restored to 1 Hit Point or more via healing, you lose the dying and unconscious conditions and can act normally on your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>If you are unconscious and at 0 Hit Points, but not dying</strong>, you naturally return to 1 Hit Point and awaken after sufficient time passes. The GM determines how long you remain unconscious, from a minimum of 10 minutes to several hours. If you receive healing during this time, you lose the unconscious condition and can act normally on your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>If you're unconscious and have more than 1 Hit Point</strong> (typically because you are asleep or unconscious due to an effect), you wake up in one of the following ways. Each causes you to lose the unconscious condition.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You take damage, provided the damage doesn't reduce you to 0 Hit Points. (If the damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious and gain the dying condition as normal.)</li>\n<li>You receive healing, other than the natural healing you get from resting.</li>\n<li>Someone nudges or shakes you awake using an Interact action.</li>\n<li>Loud noise is being made around you—though this isn't automatic. At the start of your turn, you automatically attempt a Perception check against the noise's DC (or the lowest DC if there is more than one noise), waking up if you succeed. This is often DC 5 for a battle, but if creatures are attempting to stay quiet around you, this Perception check uses their Stealth DC. Some magical effects make you sleep so deeply that they don't allow you to attempt this Perception check.</li>\n<li>If you are simply asleep, the GM decides you wake up either because you have had a restful night's sleep or something disrupted that rest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Wounded</h3>\n<p>You have been seriously injured during a fight. Anytime you lose the dying condition, you become wounded 1 if you didn't already have the wounded condition. If you already have the wounded condition, your wounded condition value instead increases by 1. If you gain the dying condition while wounded, increase the dying condition's value by your wounded value. The wounded condition ends if someone successfully restores Hit Points to you with Treat Wounds, or if you are restored to full Hit Points and rest for 10 minutes.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Doomed</h3>\n<p>Your life is ebbing away, bringing you ever closer to death. Some powerful spells and evil creatures can inflict the doomed condition on you. Doomed always includes a value. The maximum dying value at which you die is reduced by your doomed value. For example, if you were doomed 1, you would die upon reaching dying 3 instead of dying 4. If your maximum dying value is ever reduced to 0, you instantly die. When you die, you're no longer doomed.</p>\n<p>Your doomed value decreases by 1 each time you get a full night's rest.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Death</h2>\n<p>After you die, you can't act or be affected by spells that target creatures (unless they specifically target dead creatures), and for all other purposes you are an object. When you die, you are reduced to 0 Hit Points if you had a different amount, and you can't be brought above 0 Hit Points as long as you remain dead. Some magic can bring creatures back to life, such as the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Resurrect]{Resurrect} ritual or the@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Raise Dead]{Raise Dead}spell.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Heroic Recovery</h2>\n<p>If you have at least 1 Hero Point (page 467), you can spend all of your remaining Hero Points at the start of your turn or when your dying value would increase. You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilize with 0 Hit Points. You don't gain the wounded condition or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way, but if you already had that condition, you don't lose it or decrease its value.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Death Effects and Instant Death</h2>\n<p>Some spells and abilities can kill you immediately or bring you closer to death without needing to reduce you to 0 Hit Points first. These abilities have the death trait and usually involve negative energy, the antithesis of life. If you are reduced to 0 Hit Points by a death effect, you are slain instantly without needing to reach dying 4. If an effect states it kills you outright, you die without having to reach dying 4 and without being reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Massive Damage</h2>\n<p>You die instantly if you ever take damage equal to or greater than double your maximum Hit Points in one blow.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Temporary Hit Points</h2>\n<p>Some spells or abilities give you temporary Hit Points. Track these separately from your current and maximum Hit Points; when you take damage, reduce your temporary Hit Points first. Most temporary Hit Points last for a limited duration. You can't regain lost temporary Hit Points through healing, but you can gain more via other abilities. You can have temporary Hit Points from only one source at a time. If you gain temporary Hit Points when you already have some, choose whether to keep the amount you already have and their corresponding duration or to gain the new temporary Hit Points and their duration.</p>",

                "content": "<h1>Deep Backgrounds</h1>\n<p>The decision of a character background is not necessarily a complicated one; the player simply selects from the available background options to reflect their character's life before adventuring. While this is a good method for determining a character's backstory, some players might want more insight into their character's early life or family.</p>\n<h2>Using Deep Backgrounds</h2>\n<p>This variant replaces Step 4 of Character Creation. The player rolls on the tables in this section to determine their character's family background, homeland, major childhood event, influential associate, relationships, and drawbacks. Each element of the player's background adds options to the final list of ability boosts, skills, feats, and other options that their background can grant. The player writes these options down as they build their character's background. At the end of the process, they select the following from among the options written down.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two ability boosts, each to a different ability score.</li>\n<li>Training in a skill.</li>\n<li>One skill feat (or possibly another feat or piece of equipment). If the player chooses a skill feat, they become trained in its prerequisite skill, or one of its possible prerequisite skills if it has multiple (such as@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Quick Identification]{Quick Identification}). If the random results include a feat that isn't a skill feat and the player selects that feat, they don't gain training in a skill. If they choose a piece of equipment instead of a skill feat, the entry indicates what skill training, if any, they receive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Rerolling and Selecting</h3>\n<p>At your discretion, the players don't have to be bound by any results from the following tables. Depending on how your group wants to use deep backgrounds, players can reroll any result they don't like, or even select a specific option from a table that fits their emerging vision of their character. However, if you allow players to reroll or directly select options (and potentially even if you don't), you might want to exclude options that grant feats other than skill feats; these options are unusual enough that they might put too much pressure on players to select only these options. Note that the following tables reflect the <em>Core Rulebook</em> and the Age of Lost Omens setting—if your game takes place in a different setting, feel free to adjust the tables or allow players to select the options that best fit your setting.</p>\n<h2>Generating Deep Backgrounds</h2>\n<p>As a player, follow the steps below to generate your character's deep background.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Family Background</h3>\n<p>The word family means something different to everyone. You might have a biological family, adopted family, stepfamily, or any other kind and combination you choose; family bonds come in all types. To determine the number of family members you grew up with as an active part of your life, roll 1d% on the following table. Use the medium family for most ancestries, small if you're a half-elf or half-orc, and large if you're a goblin or halfling. For ancestries other than those in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, use the column that best suits the ancestry. It's up to you whether these family members are parents, siblings, grandparents, or other close relatives.</p>\n<table><caption><strong>TABLE: FAMILY SIZE</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>[[/r d100]]</strong></span></td>\n<td><strong>Small Family</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Medium Family</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Large Family</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1-4</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5-8</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9-20</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21-34</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>35-39</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40-50</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>51-60</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>61-65</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>66-69</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>70-78</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>79-80</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>81-87</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>88-90</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>91-93</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>94-95</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>96-97</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>98-99</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>8+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>8+</td>\n<td>8+</td>\n<td>8+</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>If you grew up with no family, you had to learn to survive on your own.

Roll on the following table to determine the nature of your homeland. If your character is a dwarf, subtract 3; if an elf, add 2; if a goblin, subtract 4.

However, the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Concealed]{Concealed} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Invisible]{Invisible} conditions can partially mask a creature, and the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Unnoticed]{Unnoticed} condition indicates you have no idea a creature is around.</p>\n<p>With the exception of invisible, these conditions are relative to the viewer—it's possible for a creature to be@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Observed]{Observed} to you but @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} from your ally. When you're trying to target a creature that's hard to see or otherwise sense, various drawbacks apply. Most of these rules apply to objects you're trying to detect as well as creatures.</p>\n<p>Typically, the GM tracks how well creatures detect each other, since neither party has perfect information. For example, you might think a creature is in the last place you sensed it, but it was able to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Sneak]{Sneak} away. Or you might think a creature can't see you in the dark, but it has darkvision.</p>\n<p>You can attempt to avoid detection by using the Stealth skill to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Avoid Notice]{Avoid Notice}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Hide]{Hide}, or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Sneak]{Sneak}, or by using Deception to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Create a Diversion]{Create a Diversion}.</p>\n<p>Observed</p>\n<p>In most circumstances, you can sense creatures without difficulty and target them normally. Creatures in this state are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Observed]{Observed}. Observing requires a precise sense, which for most creatures means sight, but see the @UUID[.jEf21wTIEXzGtPU6]{Detecting with Other Senses} sidebar for advice regarding creatures that don't use sight as their primary sense. If you can't observe the creature, it's either @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Undetected]{Undetected}, or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Unnoticed]{Unnoticed}, and you'll need to factor in the targeting restrictions. Even if a creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Observed]{Observed}, it might still be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Concealed]{Concealed}.</p>\n<h3>Hidden</h3>\n<p>A creature that's hidden is only barely perceptible. You know what space a hidden creature occupies, but little else. Perhaps the creature just moved behind cover and successfully used the Hide action. Your target might be in a deep fogbank or behind a waterfall, where you can see some movement but can't determine an exact location. Maybe you've been @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Blinded]{Blinded} or the creature is under the effects of@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Invisibility]{Invisibility}, but you used the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} basic action to determine its general location based on hearing alone. Regardless of the specifics, you're @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} to a @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} creature.</p>\n<p>When targeting a @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} creature, before you roll to determine your effect, you must attempt a DC 11 flat check. If you fail, you don't affect the creature, though the actions you used are still expended—as well as any spell slots, costs, and other resources. You remain flat-footed to the creature, whether you successfully target it or not.</p>\n<h3>Undetected</h3>\n<p>If a creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Undetected]{Undetected}, you don't know what space it occupies, you're @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} to it, and you can't easily target it. Using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} basic action can help you find an@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Undetected]{Undetected} creature, usually making it @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden}from you instead of @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Undetected]{Undetected}. If a creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Undetected]{Undetected}, that doesn't necessarily mean you're unaware of its presence—you might suspect an @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Undetected]{Undetected}creature is in the room with you, even though you're unable to find its space. The unnoticed condition covers creatures you're entirely unaware of.</p>\n<p>Targeting an @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Undetected]{Undetected}creature is difficult. If you suspect there's a creature around, you can pick a square and attempt an attack. This works like targeting a @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden}creature, but the flat check and attack roll are both rolled in secret by the GM. The GM won't tell you why you missed—whether it was due to failing the flat check, rolling an insufficient attack roll, or choosing the wrong square. The GM might allow you to try targeting an undetected creature with some spells or other abilities in a similar fashion. @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Undetected]{Undetected}creatures are subject to area effects normally.</p>\n<p>For instance, suppose an enemy elf wizard cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Invisibility]{Invisibility} and then @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Sneak]{Sneaked} away. You suspect that with the elf's Speed of 30 feet, they probably moved 15 feet toward an open door. You move up and attack a space 15 feet from where the elf started and directly on the path to the door. The GM secretly rolls an attack roll and flat check, but they know that you were not quite correct—the elf was actually in the adjacent space! The GM tells you that you missed, so you decide to make your next attack on the adjacent space, just in case. This time, it's the right space, and the GM's secret attack roll and flat check both succeed, so you hit!</p>\n<h3>Unnoticed</h3>\n<p>If you have no idea a creature is even present, that creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Unnoticed]{Unnoticed} by you. A creature that is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Undetected]{Undetected} might also be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Unnoticed]{Unnoticed}. This condition usually matters for abilities that can be used only against targets totally unaware of your presence.</p>",

For example, when facing a creature that can detect heartbeats, a PC trying to avoid being detected might meditate to slow their heart rate, using Wisdom instead of Dexterity as the ability modifier for the Stealth check. When a creature that can detect you has multiple senses, such as if it could also hear or see, the PC would use the lowest applicable ability modifier for the check.</p>",

The following sections offer advice on how to set appropriate DCs and tweak them as needed to feel natural for your story. Picking a simple DC and using a level-based DC each work well in certain circumstances, and you can adjust both types of DC using the advice on adjusting difficulty.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Simple DCs</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you need to quickly set a Difficulty Class. The easiest method is to select a simple DC from Table 10-4 by estimating which proficiency rank best matches the task (that rank is usually not required to succeed at the task). If it's something pretty much anyone would have a decent chance at, use the untrained DC. If it would require a degree of training, use the DC listed for trained, expert, master, or legendary proficiency, as appropriate to the complexity of the task. For example, say a PC was trying to uncover the true history behind a fable. You determine this requires a check to Recall Knowledge, and that only someone with master proficiency in Folktale Lore would know the information, so you'd set the DC at 30—the simple master DC.</p>\n<p>Simple DCs work well when you need a DC on the fly and there's no level associated with the task. They're most useful for skill checks. Because there isn't much gradation between the simple DCs, they don't work as well for hazards or combatants, where the PCs' lives are on the line; you're better off using level-based DCs for such challenges.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Level-Based DCs</h2>\n<p>When you're determining a skill DC based on something that has a level, use Table 10-5 to set the DC. Find the level of the subject, and assign the corresponding DC. Since spells use a 1-10 scale, use the Spell Level column for them.</p>\n<p>Use these DCs when a PC needs to Identify a Spell or Recall Knowledge about a creature, attempts to Earn Income by performing a task of a certain level, and so on. You can also use the level-based DCs for obstacles instead of assigning a simple DC. For example, you might determine that a wall in a high-level dungeon was constructed of smooth metal and is hard to climb. You could simply say only someone with master proficiency could climb it, and use the simple DC of 30. Or you might decide that the 15th-level villain who created the dungeon crafted the wall, and use the 15th-level DC of 34. Either approach is reasonable!</p>\n<p>Note that PCs who invest in a skill become more likely to succeed at a DC of their level as they increase in level, and the listed DCs eventually become very easy for them.</p>\n<h2>Adjusting Difficulty</h2>\n<p>You might decide a DC should differ from the baseline, whether to account for PCs' areas of expertise or to represent the rarity of spells or items. A DC adjustment represents an essential difference in the difficulty of a task and applies to anyone attempting a specific check for it. Adjustments happen most often with tasks whose DCs are based on their level. Adjustments use a scale of -10 to +10, from incredibly easy checks to incredibly hard ones, and are broken into increments of 2, 5, and 10. You'll often apply the adjustments for uncommon, rare, or unique subjects.</p>\n<p>The adjustments' names don't translate to how hard a task actually is for a PC or group of PCs, and adjustments aren't meant to balance out or replace PCs' bonuses and penalties. PCs who invest in a skill will become better and better at that skill as they increase in level. For example, even the best 1st-level PC has grim odds against an incredibly hard 1st-level DC, with a huge chance of critical failure, but by 20th level, an optimized character with a modicum of magic or assistance can take down incredibly hard 20th-level DCs over half the time, critically failing only on a 1. At higher levels, many groups will find that the very hard DC is more like standard for them; keep that in mind if you need a check that presents a true challenge to a high level group.</p>\n<p>You might use different DCs for a task based on the particular skill or statistic used for the check. Let's say your PCs encounter a magical tome about aberrant creatures. The tome is 4th-level and has the occult trait, so you set the DC of an Occultism check to Identify the Magic to 19, based on Table 10-5. As noted in Identify Magic, other magic-related skills can typically be used at a higher DC, so you might decide the check is very hard for a character using Arcana and set the DC at 24 for characters using that skill. If a character in your group had Aberration Lore, you might determine that it would be easy or very easy to use that skill and adjust the DC to 17 or 14. These adjustments aren't taking the place of characters' bonuses, modifiers, and penalties—they are due to the applicability of the skills being used.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Group Attempts</h3>\n<p>The DCs in this chapter give an individual character a strong and increasing chance of success if they have some proficiency. On occasion, though, you'll have a task that only one person in the group needs to succeed at, but that everyone can attempt. The number of dice being rolled means that there's a very high chance at least one of them will succeed. Most of the time, that's perfectly fine, but sometimes you'll want the task to be a challenge, with some uncertainty as to whether the party can succeed. In these cases, make the check very hard, or incredibly hard if you want it to be particularly difficult or at high levels. At these DCs, most of the party will probably fail, but someone will probably still succeed, likely a character who has heavily invested in the given skill, as is expected for specialized characters.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Minimum Proficiency</h2>\n<p>Sometimes succeeding at a particular task requires a character to have a specific proficiency rank in addition to a success on the check. Locks and traps often require a certain proficiency rank to successfully use the Pick a Lock or Disable a Device actions of Thievery. A character whose proficiency rank is lower than what's listed can attempt the check, but they can't succeed. You can apply similar minimum proficiencies to other tasks. You might decide, for example, that a particular arcane theorem requires training in Arcana to understand. An untrained barbarian can't succeed at the check, but she can still attempt it if she wants—after all, she needs to have a chance to critically fail and get erroneous information!</p>\n<p>For checks that require a minimum proficiency, keep the following guidelines in mind. A 2nd-level or lower task should almost never require expert proficiency, a 6th-level or lower task should almost never require master proficiency, and a 14th-level or lower task should almost never require legendary proficiency. If they did, no character of the appropriate level could succeed.</p>",

You can usually read a formula as long as you can read the language it's written in, though you might lack the skill to Craft the item. Often, alchemists and crafting guilds use obscure languages or create codes to protect their formulas from rivals.</p><p>You can buy common formulas at the Price listed on Table 6-13, or you can hire an NPC to let you copy their formula for the same Price. A purchased formula is typically a schematic on rolled-up parchment of light Bulk. You can copy a formula into your formula book in 1 hour, either from a schematic or directly from someone else's formula book. If you have a formula, you can Craft a copy of it using the Crafting skill. Formulas for uncommon items and rare items are usually significantly more valuable—if you can find them at all!</p><p>If you have an item, you can try to reverse-engineer its formula. This uses the Craft activity and takes the same amount of time as creating the item from a formula would. You must first disassemble the item. After the base downtime, you attempt a Crafting check against the same DC it would take to Craft the item. If you succeed, you Craft the formula at its full Price, and you can keep working to reduce the Price as normal. If you fail, you're left with raw materials and no formula. If you critically fail, you also waste 10% of the raw materials you'd normally be able to salvage.</p><p>The item's disassembled parts are worth half its Price in raw materials and can't be reassembled unless you successfully reverse-engineer the formula or acquire the formula another way. Reassembling the item from the formula works just like Crafting it from scratch; you use the disassembled parts as the necessary raw materials.</p>",

Unlike most aspects of your character, which persist over the long term, Hero Points last for only a single session.</p><p>The GM is in charge of awarding Hero Points (guidelines for doing so can be found on page 507). Usually, each character gets 1 Hero Point at the start of a session and can gain more later by performing heroic deeds—something selfless, daring, or beyond normal expectations. You can have a maximum of 3 Hero Points at a time, and you lose any remaining Hero Points at the end of a session.</p><p>You can spend your Hero Points in one of two ways. Neither of these is an action, and you can spend Hero Points even if you aren't able to act. You can spend a Hero Point on behalf of your familiar or animal companion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spend 1 Hero Point</strong> to reroll a check. You must use the second result. This is a fortune effect (which means you can't use more than 1 Hero Point on acheck).</li>\n<li><strong>Spend all your Hero Points</strong> (minimum 1) to avoid death. You can do this when your dying condition would increase. You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilize with 0 Hit Points. You don't gain the wounded condition or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way, but if you already had that condition, you don't lose it or decrease its value.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Describing Heroic Deeds</h2>\n<p>Because spending Hero Points reflects heroic deeds or tasks that surpass normal expectations, if you spend a Hero Point, you should describe the deed or task your character accomplishes with it to the other players.</p><p>Your character's deed might invoke a lesson learned in a past adventure, could be spurred by a determination to save someone else, or might depend on an item that ended up on their person due to a previous exploit. If you don't want to describe the deed or don't have any strong ideas about how to do so, ask the GM to come up with something for you. This can be a collaborative process, too. The GM might remind you of a long-forgotten event in the campaign, and all you have to do is fill in how that event comes to mind just at the right time, motivating you to push past your limits.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Hero Points (Rewards)</h2>\n<p>Unlike Experience Points and treasure, which stay with a character, Hero Points are granted and used on a per-session basis. At the start of a game session, you give out 1 Hero Point to each player character. You can also give out more Hero Points during the game, typically after a heroic moment or accomplishment (see below). As noted on page 467, a player can spend 1 Hero Point for a reroll, or they can spend all their Hero Points to recover when near death.</p><p>In a typical game, you'll hand out about 1 Hero Point during each hour of play after the first (for example, 3 extra points in a 4-hour session). If you want a more over-the-top game, or if your group is up against incredible odds and showing immense bravery, you might give them out at a faster rate, like 1 every 30 minutes (6 over a 4-hour session). Try to ensure each PC has opportunities to earn Hero Points, and avoid granting all of the Hero Points to a single character.</p><p>Brave last stands, protecting innocents, and using a smart strategy or spell to save the day could all earn a character a Hero Point. Look for those moments when everybody at the table celebrates or sits back in awe of a character's accomplishments; that's your cue to issue that character a Hero Point.</p><p>The party could also gain Hero Points for their accomplishments throughout the game. For a moderate or major accomplishment, consider giving out a Hero Point as well. This point typically goes to a PC who was instrumental in attaining that accomplishment.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Hero Points (GMG Advice)</h2>\n<p>Page 507 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> offers guidelines for determining how many Hero Points to award and when to do so. These recommendations are flexible. Consider Hero Points a way to reinforce your personal style of Game Mastering and to reward what you value during play. The toughest part of awarding Hero Points can be remembering to do it! Keeping a Hero Point token on hand in front of you can provide a visual and tactile reminder. You can also solicit help from your players by asking them to remind you when they think a PC's action merits a Hero Point.&lt;</p>",

The table has separate entries for thin items (like shields), ordinary items (like armor), and reinforced or durable structures (such as walls).</p><p>Stone is a catchall for any hard stone, such as granite and marble. Likewise, wood covers ordinary woods, such as oak and pine. Metal weapons and armor are assumed to be made of iron or steel unless noted otherwise.</p><p>If an object consists of more than one material, the GM typically uses the statistics for the strongest material involved. For instance, breaking a wall made of paper panels over a woven wooden framework would require damaging thin wood, not paper. However, the GM might choose the weaker material based on the item's function. For instance, breaking the wooden handle of a hammer rather than its iron head would still render the item unusable. Sometimes an item is even less sturdy than the Hardness and Hit Points provided for a thin object; for instance, a twig doesn't take 9 damage to break, even though it's made of thin wood. Similarly, a particularly sturdy item or structure might have even higher Hardness and Hit Points. Certain structures, particularly thick walls, are so reinforced that you have to break them down over time with tools.</p>",

                "content": "<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.All-Around Vision]{All-Around Vision}</h2>\n<p>This monster can see in all directions simultaneously, and therefore can't be flanked.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Aquatic Ambush]{Aquatic Ambush}</h2>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The monster is hiding in water and a creature that hasn't detected it is within the listed number of feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster moves up to its swim Speed + 10 feet toward the triggering creature, traveling on water and on land. Once the creature is in reach, the monster makes a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Strike]{Strike} against it. The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} against this Strike.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Attack of Opportunity]{Attack of Opportunity}</h2>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster attempts a melee @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Strike]{Strike} against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.At-Will Spells]{At-Will Spells}</h2>\n<p>The monster can cast its at-will spells any number of times without using up spell slots.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Aura]{Aura}</h2>\n<p>A monster's aura automatically affects everything within a specified emanation around that monster. The monster doesn't need to spend actions on the aura; rather, the aura's effects are applied at specific times, such as when a creature ends its turn in the aura or when creatures enter the aura.</p>\n<p>If an aura does nothing but deal damage, its entry lists only the radius, damage, and saving throw. Such auras deal this damage to a creature when the creature enters the aura and when a creature starts its turn in the aura. A creature can take damage from the aura only once per round.</p>\n<p>The GM might determine that a monster's aura doesn't affect its own allies. For example, a creature might be immune to a monster's frightful presence if they have been around each other for a long time.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Buck]{Buck}</h2>\n<p>Most monsters that serve as mounts can attempt to buck off unwanted or annoying riders, but most mounts will not use this reaction against a trusted creature unless the mounts are spooked or mistreated.</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Mount]{Mounts} or uses the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Command an Animal]{Command an Animal} action while riding the monster.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The triggering creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw against the listed DC or fall off the creature and land prone. If the save is a critical failure, the triggering creature also takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage in addition to the normal damage for the fall.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Catch Rock]{Catch Rock}</h2>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The monster must have a free hand but can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Release]{Release} anything it's holding as part of this reaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> The monster is targeted with a thrown rock @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Strike]{Strike} or a rock would fall on the monster.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its AC against the triggering attack or to any defense against the falling rock. If the attack misses or the monster successfully defends against the falling rock, the monster catches the rock, takes no damage, and is now holding the rock.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Change Shape]{Change Shape}</h2>\n<p>(concentrate, [magical tradition], polymorph, transmutation) The monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Impersonate]{Impersonate} use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Constant Spells]{Constant Spells}</h2>\n<p>A constant spell affects the monster without the monster needing to cast it, and its duration is unlimited. If a constant spell gets counteracted, the monster can reactivate it by spending the normal spellcasting actions the spell\u001crequires.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Constrict]{Constrict}</h2>\n<p>The monster deals the listed amount of damage to any number of creatures @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Grabbed]{Grabbed} or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Restrained]{Restrained} by it. Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save with the listed DC.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Coven]{Coven}</h2>\n<p>(divination, mental, occult) This monster can form a coven with two or more other creatures who also have the coven ability. This involves performing an 8-hour ceremony with all prospective coven members. After the coven is formed, each of its members gains elite adjustments, adjusting their levels accordingly. Coven members can sense other members' locations and conditions by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and can sense what another coven member is sensing as a two-action activity, which has the concentrate trait as well.</p>\n<p>Covens also grant spells and rituals to their members, but these can be cast only in cooperation between three coven members who are all within 30 feet of one another. A coven member can contribute to a coven spell with a single-action spellcasting activity that has a single verbal component. If two coven members have contributed these actions within the last round, a third member can cast a coven spell on her turn by spending the normal spellcasting actions. A coven can cast its coven spells an unlimited number of times but can cast only one coven spell each round. All covens grant the 8th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Baleful Polymorph]{Baleful Polymorph}</em> spell and all the following spells, which the coven can cast at any level up to 5th: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Augury]{Augury}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Charm]{Charm}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Clairaudience]{Clairaudience}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Clairvoyance]{Clairvoyance}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Dream Message]{Dream Message}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Illusory Disguise]{Illusory Disguise}</em>,<em> @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Illusory Scene]{Illusory Scene}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Prying Eye]{Prying Eye}</em>, and <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Talking Corpse]{Talking Corpse}</em>. Individual creatures with the coven ability also grant additional spells to any coven they join. A coven can also cast the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Control Weather]{Control Weather}</em> ritual, with a DC of 23 instead of the standard DC.</p>\n<p>If a coven member leaving the coven or the death of a coven member brings the coven below three members, the remaining members keep their elite adjustments for 24 hours, but without enough members to contribute the necessary actions, they can't cast coven spells.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Darkvision]{Darkvision}</h2>\n<p>A monster with darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only. Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-level <em>darkness</em> spell, block normal darkvision. A monster with greater darkvision, however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Disease]{Disease}</h2>\n<p>When a creature is exposed to a monster's disease, it attempts a Fortitude save or succumbs to the disease. The level of a disease is the level of the monster in\u001f icting the disease. The disease follows the rules for afflictions.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Engulf]{Engulf}</h2>\n<p>The monster @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Stride]{Strides} up to double its Speed and can move through the spaces of any creatures in its path. Any creature of the monster's size or smaller whose space the monster moves through can attempt a Reflex save with the listed DC to avoid being engulfed. A creature unable to act automatically critically fails this save. If a creature succeeds at its save, it can choose to be either pushed aside (out of the monster's path) or pushed in front of the monster to the end of the monster's movement. The monster can attempt to Engulf the same creature only once in a single use of Engulf. The monster can contain as many creatures as can fit in its space.</p>\n<p>A creature that fails its save is pulled into the monster's body. It is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Grabbed]{Grabbed}, is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Slowed]{Slowed 1}, and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The creature takes the listed amount of damage when first engulfed and at the end of each of its turns while it's engulfed. An engulfed creature can get free by @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Escape]{Escaping} against the listed escape DC. An engulfed creature can attack the monster engulfing it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The engulfing creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either method can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.</p>\n<p>If the monster dies, all creatures it has engulfed are automatically released as the monster's form loses cohesion.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Fast Healing]{Fast Healing}</h2>\n<p>A monster with this ability regains the given number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Ferocity]{Ferocity}</h2>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> The monster is reduced to 0 HP.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster avoids being knocked out and remains at 1 HP, but its @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Wounded]{Wounded} value increases by 1. When it is wounded 3, it can no longer use this ability.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Frightful Presence]{Frightful Presence}</h2>\n<p>(aura, emotion, fear, mental) A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save. Regardless of the result of the saving throw, the creature is temporarily immune to this monster's Frightful Presence for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected by the presence.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Frightened]{Frightened 1}.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is frightened 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is frightened 4.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Grab]{Grab}</h2>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The monster's last action was a success with a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Strike]{Strike} that lists Grab in its damage entry, or it has a creature grabbed using this action.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster automatically @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Grapple]{Grabs} the target until the end of the monster's next turn. The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Grabbed]{Grabbed} by whichever body part the monster attacked with, and that body part can't be used to Strike creatures until the grab is ended.</p>\n<p>Using Grab extends the duration of the monster's Grab until the end of its next turn for all creatures grabbed by it. A grabbed creature can use the Escape action to get out of the grab, and the Grab ends for a grabbed creatures if the monster moves away from it.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Greater Constrict]{Greater Constrict}</h2>\n<p>The monster deals the listed amount of damage to any number of creatures @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Grab]{Grabbed} or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Restrained]{Restrained} by it. Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save with the listed DC. A creature that fails this save falls unconscious, and a creature that succeeds is then temporarily immune to falling unconscious from Greater Constrict for 1 minute.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Improved Grab]{Improved Grab}</h2>\n<p>The monster can use Grab as a free action triggered by a hit with its initial attack. A monster with Improved Grab still needs to spend an action to extend the duration for creatures it already has grabbed.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Improved Knockdown]{Improved Knockdown}</h2>\n<p>The monster can use Knockdown as a free action triggered by a hit with its initial attack.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Improved Push]{Improved Push}</h2>\n<p>The monster can use Push as a free action triggered by a hit with its initial attack.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Knockdown]{Knockdown}</h2>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The monster's last action was a success with a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Strike]{Strike} that lists Knockdown in its damage entry.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster knocks the target @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Prone]{Prone}.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Lifesense]{Lifesense}</h2>\n<p>Lifesense allows a monster to sense the vital essence of living and undead creatures within the listed range. The sense can distinguish between the positive energy animating living creatures and the negative energy animating undead creatures, much as sight distinguishes colors.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Light Blindness]{Light Blindness}</h2>\n<p>When first exposed to bright light, the monster is blinded until the end of its next turn. After this exposure, light doesn't blind the monster again until after it spends 1 hour in darkness. However, as long as the monster is in an area of bright light, it's @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Dazzled]{Dazzled}.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Low-Light Vision]{Low-Light Vision}</h2>\n<p>The monster can see in dim light as though it were bright light, so it ignores the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Concealed]{Concealed} condition due to dim light.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Negative Healing]{Negative Healing}</h2>\n<p>A creature with negative healing draws health from negative energy rather than positive energy. It is damaged by positive damage and is not healed by positive healing effects. It does not take negative damage, and it is healed by negative effects that heal undead.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Poison]{Poison}</h2>\n<p>When a creature is exposed to a monster's poison, it attempts a Fortitude save to avoid becoming poisoned. The level of a poison is the level of the monster inflicting the poison. The poison follows the rules for afflictions.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Push]{Push}</h2>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The monster's last action was a success with a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Strike]{Strike} that lists Push in its damage entry.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster automatically knocks the target away from the monster. Unless otherwise noted in the ability description, the creature is pushed 5 feet. If the attack was a critical hit, this distance is doubled.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Regeneration]{Regeneration}</h2>\n<p>This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Dying]{Dying} condition never increases beyond dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to dying 4.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Rend]{Rend}</h2>\n<p>A Rend entry lists a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Strike]{Strike} the monster has.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The monster hit the same enemy with two consecutive Strikes of the listed type in the same round.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster automatically deals that Strike's damage again to the enemy.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Retributive Strike]{Retributive Strike}</h2>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An enemy damages the monster's ally, and both are within 15 feet of the monster.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + the monster's level. If the foe is within reach, the monster makes a melee @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Strike]{Strike} against it.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Scent]{Scent}</h2>\n<p>Scent involves sensing creatures or objects by smell, and is usually a vague sense. The range is listed in the ability, and it functions only if the creature or object being detected emits an aroma (for instance, incorporeal creatures usually do not exude an aroma).</p>\n<p>If a creature emits a heavy aroma or is upwind, the GM can double or even triple the range of scent abilities used to detect that creature, and the GM can reduce the range if a creature is downwind.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Shield Block]{Shield Block}</h2>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> The monster has its shield raised and takes damage from a physical attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster snaps its shield into place to deflect a blow. The shield prevents the monster from taking an amount of damage up to the shield's Hardness. The monster and the shield each take any remaining damage, possibly breaking or destroying the shield.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Sneak Attack]{Sneak Attack}</h2>\n<p>When the monster @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Strike]{Strikes} a creature that has the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, or a ranged weapon attack, it also deals the listed precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, that weapon must also be an agile or finesse weapon.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Swallow Whole]{Swallow Whole}</h2>\n<p>(attack) The monster attempts to swallow a creature of the listed size or smaller that it has @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Grabbed]{Grabbed} in its jaws or mouth. If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an Athletics check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Strike]{Strike} or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.</p>\n<p>A swallowed creature is grabbed, is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Slowed]{Slowed 1}, and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it's swallowed. If the victim @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Escape]{Escapes} this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The engulfing creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.</p>\n<p>If the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Swarm Mind]{Swarm Mind}</h2>\n<p>This monster doesn't have a single mind (typically because it's a swarm of smaller creatures), and is immune to mental effects that target only a specific number of creatures. It is still subject to mental effects that affect all creatures in an area.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Telepathy]{Telepathy}</h2>\n<p>(aura, divination, magical) A monster with telepathy can communicate mentally with any creatures within the listed radius, as long as they share a language. This doesn't give any special access to their thoughts, and communicates no more information than normal speech would.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Throw Rock]{Throw Rock}</h2>\n<p>The monster picks up a rock within reach or retrieves a stowed rock and throws it, making a ranged @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Strike]{Strike}.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Trample]{Trample}</h2>\n<p>The monster @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Stride]{Strides} up to double its Speed and can move through the spaces of creatures of the listed size, Trampling each creature whose space it enters. The monster can attempt to Trample the same creature only once in a single use of Trample. The monster deals the damage of the listed Strike, but trampled creatures can attempt a basic Reflex save at the listed DC (no damage on a critical success, half damage on a success, double damage on a critical failure).</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Tremorsense]{Tremorsense}</h2>\n<p>Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Wavesense]{Wavesense}</h2>\n<p>This sense allows a monster to feel vibrations caused by movement through a liquid. It's an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Wavesense functions only if monster and the subject are in the same body of liquid, and only if the subject is moving through the liquid.</p>",

Such games are about hedging bets in an uncertain and gritty world, in which even the world's best fighter can't guarantee a win against a large group of moderately skilled brigands. In games like these, your group might want to consider removing the character's level from the proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p>The initial implementation is fairly straightforward: the proficiency bonus just becomes +2 for trained, +4 for expert, +6 for master, and +8 for legendary. We recommend giving an untrained character a -2 proficiency modifier instead of a +0 proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p>Additionally, for creatures, hazards, magic items, and so on, reduce each statistic that would include a proficiency bonus by the level of the creature or other rules element. These statistics are typically modifiers and DCs for attacks, ACs, saving throws, Perception, skills, and spells.</p>\n<p>Finally, decrease the skill DCs of most tasks to account for the level being removed. You can just subtract the level from the DC tables in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, or you can reference Table: Simple Skill DCs (No Level) for a set of DCs that's easier to remember. The new DCs make it a little harder for high-level characters to succeed than it would be when using the default numbers from the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, in keeping with the theme mentioned earlier. Combat outcomes will tend to flatten out, with critical successes and critical failures being less likely across the game. This is particularly notable in spells, where you're less likely to see the extreme effects of critical failures on saves.</p>\n<h3>Adjusting Encounters</h3>\n<p>Telling stories where a large group of low-level monsters can still be a significant threat to a high-level PC (and conversely, a single higher-level monster is not much of a threat to a group of PCs) requires some significant shifts in encounter building, including shifts in the PCs' rewards.</p>\n<p>Under the math in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, two monsters of a certain level are roughly as challenging as a single monster 2 levels higher. However, with level removed from proficiency, this assumption is no longer true. The XP budget for creatures uses a different scale, as shown in Table: Creature XP (No Level). You'll still use the same XP budget for a given threat level as shown on @UUID[.9hfEG4kJmEbrjGS1]{Encounter Building &amp; XP Awards} (80 XP for a moderate-threat encounter, 120 for a severe-threat encounter, and so on).</p>\n<h3>Table: Creature XP (No Level)</h3>\n<p>While the XP values in Table: Creature XP (No Level) work well in most cases, sometimes they might not account for the effects of creatures' special abilities when facing a party of a drastically different level. For instance, a ghost mage could prove too much for 5th-level PCs with its incorporeality, flight, and high-level spells, even though it's outnumbered.</p>\n<h3>Adjusting Treasure</h3>\n<p>Treasure and the cost of items in the <em>Core Rulebook</em> are designed to make it as easy as possible for you to build encounters without worrying about awarding too much or too little treasure based on whether you use creatures who carry items. However, using this variant, the PCs might defeat a creature 5 levels higher than they are, or even more! Too many encounters with higher-level foes can wind up giving the PCs more treasure than you expected, or vice-versa if they're fighting weaker foes that put up more of a fight but still have poor treasure. You can nudge this in the right direction by making periodic adjustments if the PCs' treasure drifts too far from expectations. Making it so they can't easily sell or buy magic items will mean it's harder for them to exploit treasure they gain. To sidestep the treasure economy entirely, you can use the @UUID[.SnSGU7DPiogZ9JOr]{Automatic Bonus Progression}.</p>",

Unlike favors, disservices don't have as easy a correspondence with in-game time; a quick but particularly egregious action could easily still be a major disservice.

Minor disservices take away 1 Reputation Point.</li>\n<li>Moderate disservices are more than just a nuisance or annoyance, generally significantly hindering the group's efforts or violating a fundamental tenet of the group's beliefs in a significant but not egregious way. Moderate disservices take away 2 Reputation Points.</li>\n<li>Major disservices are incredibly antagonistic to a group, usually a single brazen act, such as thwarting a cabal's apocalyptic doomsday plan.

Every member has heard of the PCs, is helpful toward them, and would take major risks to assist them. Only major favors accrue Reputation Points, and only moderate or major disservices can reduce them.</p>\n<h3>Disliked</h3>\n<p>The PCs have a poor reputation among members of this group. Many members of the group know about the PCs, and are usually unfriendly to them. At this reputation, only moderate and major disservices reduce Reputation Points.</p>\n<h3>Hated</h3>\n<p>The PCs have earned this group's ire. The vast majority of the group knows about the PCs and have an extremely unfavorable opinion toward them. Many members of the group are hostile toward the PCs, and those who aren't are unfriendly. When presented an easy opportunity to hurt the PCs, the group will jump at the chance. Only major disservices can still reduce Reputation Points.</p>\n<h3>Hunted</h3>\n<p>The group actively hunts the PCs as scapegoats or nemeses, even at significant cost to itself. Every member has heard of the PCs, is hostile toward them, and would take major risks to thwart or destroy them.

                "content": "<p>The ways a creature can use Perception depend on what senses it has. The primary concepts you need to know for understanding senses are precise senses, imprecise senses, and the three states of detection a target can be in:@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Observed]{Observed}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden}, or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Undetected]{Undetected}. Vision, hearing, and scent are three prominent senses, but they don't have the same degree of acuity.</p>\n<h2>Precise Senses</h2>\n<p>Average vision is a precise sense—a sense that can be used to perceive the world in nuanced detail. The only way to target a creature without having drawbacks is to use a precise sense. You can usually detect a creature automatically with a precise sense unless that creature is hiding or obscured by the environment, in which case you can use the@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} basic action to better detect the creature.</p>\n<h2>Imprecise Senses</h2>\n<p>Hearing is an imprecise sense—it cannot detect the full range of detail that a precise sense can. You can usually sense a creature automatically with an imprecise sense, but it has the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} condition instead of the observed condition. It might be undetected by you if it's using Stealth or is in an environment that distorts the sense, such as a noisy room in the case of hearing. In those cases, you have to use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} basic action to detect the creature. At best, an imprecise sense can be used to make an undetected creature (or one you didn't even know was there) merely @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden}—it can't make the creature @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Observed]{Observed}.</p>\n<h2>Vague Senses</h2>\n<p>A character also has many vague senses—ones that can alert you that something is there but aren't useful for zeroing in on it to determine exactly what it is. The most useful of these for a typical character is the sense of smell. At best, a vague sense can be used to detect the presence of an unnoticed creature, making it undetected. Even then, the vague sense isn't sufficient to make the creature @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} or@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Observed]{Observed}.</p><p>When one creature might detect another, the GM almost always uses the most precise sense available.</p><p>Pathfinder's rules assume that a given creature has vision as its only precise sense and hearing as its only imprecise sense. Some characters and creatures, however, have precise or imprecise senses that don't match this assumption. For instance, a character with poor vision might treat that sense as imprecise, an animal with the scent ability can use its sense of smell as an imprecise sense, and a creature with echolocation or a similar ability can use hearing as a precise sense. Such senses are often given special names and appear as “echolocation (precise),” “scent (imprecise) 30 feet,” or the like.</p>\n<h1>Special Senses</h1>\n<p>While a human might have a difficult time making creatures out in dim light, an elf can see those creatures just fine. And though elves have no problem seeing on a moonlit night, their vision cannot penetrate complete darkness, whereas a dwarf's can.</p><p>Special senses grant greater awareness that allows a creature with these senses to either ignore or reduce the effects of the undetected, hidden, or concealed conditions (described in Detecting Creatures below) when it comes to situations that foil average vision. The following are a few examples of common special senses.</p>\n<h2>Darkvision and Greater Darkvision</h2>\n<p>A creature with darkvision or greater darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only. Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Darkness]{Darkness} spell, block normal darkvision. A creature with greater darkvision, however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness.</p>\n<h2>Low-Light Vision</h2>\n<p>A creature with low-light vision can see in dim light as though it were bright light, so it ignores the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Concealed]{Concealed} condition due to dim light.</p>\n<h2>Scent</h2>\n<p>Scent involves sensing creatures or objects by smell, and is usually a vague sense. The range is listed in the ability, and it functions only if the creature or object being detected emits an aroma (for instance, incorporeal creatures usually do not exude an aroma).</p><p>If a creature emits a heavy aroma or is upwind, the GM can double or even triple the range of scent abilities used to detect that creature, and the GM can reduce the range if a creature is downwind.</p>\n<h2>Tremorsense</h2>\n<p>Tremorsense allows a creature to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is usually an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the detecting creature is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface.</p>",

                "content": "<p>Sometimes fights occur while the characters are atop mounts or when the PCs take to the sky or seas.</p>\n<h2>Mounted Combat</h2>\n<p>You can ride some creatures into combat. As noted in the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Mount]{Mount} specialty basic action, your mount needs to be at least one size larger than you and willing. Your mount acts on your initiative. You must use the Command an Animal action to get your mount to spend its actions. If you don't, the animal wastes its actions. If you have the Ride general feat, you succeed automatically when you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Command an Animal]{Command an Animal} that's your mount.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are mounted on a horse and you make three attacks, your horse would remain stationary since you didn't command it. If you instead spent your first action to Command an Animal and succeeded, you could get your mount to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Stride]{Stride}. You could spend your next action to attack or to command the horse to attack, but not both.</p>\n<h3><strong>Mounted Attacks</strong></h3>\n<p>You and your mount fight as a unit. Consequently, you share a multiple attack penalty. For example, if you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Strike]{Strike} and then Command an Animal to have your mount Strike, your mount's attack takes a -5 multiple attack penalty.</p>\n<p>You occupy every square of your mount's space for the purpose of making your attacks. If you were Medium and on a Large mount, you could attack a creature on one side of your mount, then attack on the opposite side with your next action. If you have a longer reach, the distance depends partly on the size of your mount. On a Medium or smaller mount, use your normal reach. On a Large or Huge mount, you can attack any square adjacent to the mount if you have 5- or 10-foot reach, or any square within 10 feet of the mount (including diagonally) if you have 15-foot reach.</p>\n<h3><strong>Mounted Defenses</strong></h3>\n<p>When you're mounted, attackers can target either you or your mount. Anything that affects multiple creatures (such as an area) affects both of you as long as you're both in the area. You are in an attacker's reach or range if any square of your mount is within reach or range. Because your mount is larger than you and you share its space, you have lesser cover against attacks targeting you when you're mounted if the mount would be in the way.</p>\n<p>Because you can't move your body as freely while you're riding a mount, you take a -2 circumstance penalty to Reflex saves while mounted. Additionally, the only move action you can use is the Mount action to dismount.</p>\n<h2>Aerial Combat</h2>\n<p>Many monsters can fly, and PCs can use spells and items to gain the ability to fly. Flying creatures have to use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Fly]{Fly} action to move through the air. Performing an especially tricky maneuver—such as trying to reverse course 180 degrees or fly through a narrow gap—might require using Acrobatics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Maneuver in Flight]{Maneuver in Flight}. Creatures might fall from the sky, using the falling rules. At the GM's discretion, some ground-based actions might not work in the air. For instance, a flying creature couldn't @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Leap]{Leap}.</p>\n<h2>Aquatic Combat</h2>\n<p>Use these rules for battles in water or underwater:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You're flat-footed unless you have a swim Speed.</li>\n<li>You gain resistance 5 to acid and fire.</li>\n<li>You take a -2 circumstance penalty to melee slashing or bludgeoning attacks that pass through water.</li>\n<li>Ranged attacks that deal bludgeoning or slashing damage automatically miss if the attacker or target is underwater, and piercing ranged attacks made by an underwater creature or against an underwater target have their range increments halved.</li>\n<li>You can't cast fire spells or use actions with the fire trait underwater.</li>\n<li>At the GM's discretion, some ground-based actions might not work underwater or while floating.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Drowning and Suffocation</strong></h3>\n<p>You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier. Reduce your remaining air by 1 round at the end of each of your turns, or by 2 if you attacked or cast any spells that turn. You also lose 1 round worth of air each time you are critically hit or critically fail a save against a damaging effect. If you speak (including casting spells with verbal components or activating items with command components) you lose all remaining air.</p>\n<p>When you run out of air, you fall unconscious and start suffocating. You can't recover from being unconscious and must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:20] save at the end of each of your turns. On a failure, you take 1d10 damage, and on a critical failure, you die. On each check after the first, the DC increases by 5 and the damage by 1d10; these increases are cumulative. Once your access to air is restored, you stop suffocating and are no longer unconscious (unless you're at 0 Hit Points).</p>",

If your group wants to tell tales like those, you can use the stamina variant to help make that happen.</p>\n<h2>Stamina Points</h2>\n<p>Stamina Points represent a character's energy and readiness. They're reduced by damage just like Hit Points, but a character always loses their Stamina Points first, and loses Hit Points only if they're out of Stamina Points. If a character takes damage exceeding their remaining Stamina Points, the excess damage reduces their Hit Points. However, they lose any temporary Hit Points before losing Stamina Points.</p>\n<p>Though Stamina Points and Hit Points function similarly when a character takes damage, a character recovers them differently. A <em>heal</em> spell restores Hit Points, not Stamina Points, and the actions described below (like Take a Breather) restore only Stamina Points, not Hit Points. A character regains all their Stamina Points after a full night's rest. Hit Points still determine whether a character remains conscious—a character at 0 HP is unconscious, no matter how many Stamina Points they have. In addition to their ancestry Hit Points, a PC gains the number of Stamina Points and Hit Points indicated in the second and third columns of table above at 1st level. Both values increase by the same amount at each level thereafter. This replaces the Hit Points a character gains from their class in a standard game.</p>\n<h2>Resolve Points</h2>\n<p>In this variant, each PC also has a pool of Resolve Points, representing their intrinsic grit and luck. A character's maximum Resolve Points is equal to their key ability modifier, and a character regains all their Resolve Points with a full night's rest. In addition to spending Resolve Points to regain Stamina Points (as described under Stamina Actions), characters can spend Resolve Points in the following way.</p>\n<h3>Stabilize</h3>\n<p>If a character is dying at the start of their turn, their player can spend 1 Resolve Point to stabilize at 0 HP, gaining or increasing the wounded condition as normal for stabilizing. At the start of the character's next turn, they gain 1 HP and wake up (unless they started dying again). The character can act on that turn. Consider this an optional rule best suited for groups that have little access to healing. When using this rule, you might remove the ability for characters to use Hero Points to stabilize.</p>\n<h2>Stamina Actions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Take a Breather]{Take a Breather}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Rally]{Rally}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Stamina Feats</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Encouraging Words]{Encouraging Words}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Steel Your Resolve]{Steel Your Resolve}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other Creatures</h2>\n<p>There's no need to give Stamina Points to monsters that are expected to be encountered once and likely defeated. However, you might use Stamina Points for a recurring character, especially an NPC who fights alongside the PCs. Usually, it's easiest to turn half the creature's Hit Points into Stamina Points. While enemy healers still work as they're intended to, players might be upset about the enemies' ability to heal their allies to full Hit Points, while the PCs are left not being able to heal their allies' Stamina Points. In this case, give more enemies Stamina Points to compensate.</p>\n<h2>No-Limit Stamina</h2>\n<p>If you want a fast-paced, almost superheroic game, you can skip the Resolve Point component of this subsystem and simply make Taking a Breather and Rally free. This gives the characters a lot of staying power, meaning that the group will typically keep adventuring until they run out of spells for the day, rather than having the additional pressure of running out of Resolve Points. If you use this approach, omit the Steel Your Resolve feat, as it's too powerful if there's no cost to use it! Alternatively, if you want to keep it, you can require a character to Take a Breather before they can Steel their Resolve again.</p>\n<h2>Stamina's Impact</h2>\n<p>The main gameplay consequence of using these stamina rules is that a quick 10- or 20-minute rest can restore most groups to full or nearly full health via Taking a Breather and Treating Wounds as necessary, allowing more encounters with shorter breaks in between. Additionally, charismatic or otherwise diplomatic characters gain fun and useful ways to bolster their allies.</p>\n<p>Because spells that heal Hit Points don't restore Stamina Points, it's a little harder to heal up completely in the middle of a fight. This can mean that fights become deadly after characters have been beaten down, possibly causing retreats to be more frequent, but the retreats themselves are shorter. The focus of the game can stay consistently within encounters, with less managing of time and resources outside of battle.</p>",

Moving into a square of difficult terrain (or moving 5 feet into or within an area of difficult terrain, if you're not using a grid) costs an extra 5 feet of movement. Moving into a square of greater difficult terrain instead costs 10 additional feet of movement. This additional cost is not increased when moving diagonally. You can't @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Step]{Step} into difficult terrain.</p><p>Movement you make while you are jumping ignores the terrain you're jumping over. Some abilities (such as flight or being incorporeal) allow you to avoid the movement reduction from some types of difficult terrain. Certain other abilities let you ignore difficult terrain on foot; such an ability also allows you to move through greater difficult terrain at the normal movement cost as for difficult terrain, though it wouldn't let you ignore greater difficult terrain unless the ability specifies otherwise.</p>\n<h2>Hazardous Terrain</h2>\n<p>Hazardous terrain damages you whenever you move through it. An acid pool and a pit of burning embers are both examples of hazardous terrain. The amount and type of damage depend on the specific hazardous terrain.</p>\n<h2>Narrow Surfaces</h2>\n<p>A narrow surface is so precariously thin that you need to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Balance]{Balance} (see Acrobatics) or risk falling. Even on a success, you are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed}on a narrow surface. Each time you are hit by an attack or fail a save on a narrow surface, you must succeed at a Reflex save (with the same DC as the Acrobatics check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Balance]{Balance}) or fall.</p>\n<h2>Uneven Ground</h2>\n<p>Uneven ground is an area unsteady enough that you need to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Balance]{Balance} (see Acrobatics) or risk falling @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Prone]{Prone} and possibly injuring yourself, depending on the specifics of the uneven ground. You are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} on uneven ground. Each time you are hit by an attack or fail a save on uneven ground, you must succeed at a Reflex save (with the same DC as the Acrobatics check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Balance]{Balance}) or fall prone.</p>\n<h2>Inclines</h2>\n<p>An incline is an area so steep that you need to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Climb]{Climb} using the Athletics skill in order to progress upward. You're @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} hen @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Climb]{Climbing} an incline.</p>",

class=\"title\">Treasure (Creative Adventures)</h2>\n<p>Your adventure should give out an amount of treasure that's appropriate to the characters' level. The guidelines for assigning treasure are on page 508. You can dole out treasure in all kinds of ways. Treasure could be items carried by an adversary, rewards from a patron for completing a mission, or a classic pile of coins and items inside a wooden chest guarded by a monster. It's best to spread treasure throughout an adventure rather than stockpiled in a single hoard. This gives the players incremental rewards, letting their characters advance in frequent small steps rather than giant leaps separated by many hours of play.</p>\n<h2>Treasure</h2>\n<p>As the GM, it's your job to distribute treasure to the player characters. Treasure appears throughout an adventure, and the PCs obtain it by raiding treasure hoards, defeating foes who carry valuable items or currency, getting paid for successful quests, and any other way you can imagine.</p>\n<p>This section provides guidelines for distributing treasure in a typical Pathfinder campaign, but you always have the freedom to assign extra treasure for a high-powered game, less treasure for a gritty survival horror adventure, or any amount in between.</p>\n<h2>Treasure by Level</h2>\n<p>Party Treasure by Level table on top of this page shows how much treasure you should give out over the course of a level for a group of four PCs. The Total Value column gives an approximate total value of all the treasure, in case you want to spend it like a budget. The next several columns provide suggestions for breaking down that total into permanent items, which the PCs keep and use for a long time; consumables, which are destroyed after being used once; and currency, which includes coins, gems, and other valuables primarily spent to acquire items or services. The final column gives the amount of currency to add for each PC beyond four in the group; use this only if you have more than four characters in the game.</p>\n<p>For instance, between the time your PCs reach 3rd level and the time they reach 4th level, you should give them the treasure listed in the table for 3rd level, worth approximately 500 gp: two 4th-level permanent items, two 3rd-level permanent items, two 4th-level consumables, two 3rd-level consumables, two 2nd-level consumables, and 120 gp worth of currency.</p>\n<p>When assigning 1st-level permanent items, your best options are armor, weapons, and other gear from Chapter 6 worth between 10 and 20 gp. The treasure listed in the row for 20th level represents a full level's worth of adventures, even though there is no way to reach 21st level.</p>\n<p>Some creature entries in the Pathfinder Bestiary list treasure that can be gained by defeating an individual creature; this counts toward the treasure for any given level. Published adventures include a suitable amount of treasure throughout the adventure, though you should still monitor the party's capabilities as the PCs progress through the adventure to make sure they don't end up behind.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Currency</h3>\n<p>A party will find money and other treasure that isn't useful on its own but that can be sold or spent on other things. The gp values in the Party Currency column don't refer only to coins. Gems, art objects, crafting materials (including precious materials), jewelry, and even items of much lower level than the party's level can all be more interesting than a pile of gold.</p>\n<p>If you include a lower-level permanent item as part of a currency reward, count only half the item's Price toward the gp amount, assuming the party will sell the item or use it as crafting material. But lower-level consumables might still be useful, particularly scrolls, and if you think your party will use them, count those items at their full Price.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Other Types of Treasure</h3>\n<p>Not all treasure has to be items or currency. Crafters can use the Crafting skill to turn raw materials directly into items instead of buying those items with coins. Knowledge can expand a character's abilities, and formulas make good treasure for item-crafting characters. A spellcaster might get access to new spells from an enemy's spellbook or an ancient scholar, while a monk might retrain techniques with rarer ones learned from a master on a remote mountaintop.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Treasure and Rarity</h3>\n<p>Giving out uncommon and rare items and formulas can get players more interested in treasure. It's best to introduce uncommon items as a reward fairly regularly but rare items only occasionally. These rewards are especially compelling when the adventurers get the item by defeating or outsmarting an enemy who carries an item that fits their backstory or theme.</p>\n<p>Uncommon and rare formulas make great treasure for a character who Crafts items. Note that if an uncommon or rare formula is broadly disseminated, it eventually becomes more common. This can take months or years, but the item might start showing up in shops all around the world.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Different Item Levels</h3>\n<p>The levels listed for items on Table 10-9: Party Treasure by Level aren't set in stone. You can provide items of slightly higher or lower level as long as you take into account the value of the items you hand out. For instance, suppose you were considering giving a party of 11th-level PCs a <em>runestone</em> with a <em>fortification</em> rune (with a Price of 2,000 gp) as one of their 12th-level items, but you realize they've had trouble finding armor in their recent adventures, so you instead decide to give them a suit of 11th-level <em>+2 resilient armor</em> (1,400 gp) instead. Since the armor has a lower Price than the rune, you might also add a 9th-level <em>shadow</em> rune (650 gp) to make up the difference. The total isn't exactly the same, but that's all right.</p>\n<p>However, if you wanted to place a 13th-level permanent item in a treasure hoard, you could remove two 11th-level permanent items to make a roughly equivalent exchange. When you make an exchange upward like this, be cautious: not only might you introduce an item with effects that are disruptive at the party's current level of play, but you also might give an amazing item to one PC while other characters don't gain any new items at all!</p>\n<p>If you're playing in a long-term campaign, you can spread out the treasure over time. A major milestone can give extra treasure at one level, followed by a tougher dungeon with fewer new items at the next level. Check back occasionally to see whether each PC's treasure is comparable to the amount they'd get if they created a new character at their current level, as described under Treasure for New Characters below. They should be a bit higher. but if there's a significant discrepancy, adjust the adventure's upcoming treasure rewards accordingly.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Different Party Sizes</h3>\n<p>If a party has more than four characters, add the following for each additional character:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One permanent item of the party's level or 1 levelhigher</li>\n<li>Two consumables, usually one of the party's level and one of 1 level higher</li>\n<li>Currency equal to the value in the Currency per Additional PC column of Table 10-9</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the party has fewer than four characters, you can subtract the same amount for each missing character, but since the game is inherently more challenging with a smaller group that can't cover all roles as efficiently, you might consider subtracting less treasure and allowing the extra gear help compensate for the smaller group size.</p>\n<p><strong>Sidebar(s) </strong>@UUID[.f2wr86966A0oUUA0]{Adjusting Treasure}</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Buying and Selling Items</h2>\n<p>Characters can usually buy and sell items only during downtime. An item can typically be sold for only half its Price, though art objects, gems, and raw materials can be sold for their full Price.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Treasure (GMG Advice)</h2>\n<p>The game's math is based on PCs looking to find, buy, or craft items that are the same level as them—this includes weapons and armor with fundamental runes, and items that help with the PC's favorite skills or tactics. A PC who gets the item at that level will typically be ahead of the monsters, hazards, and skill DCs briefly, before their challenges start to catch back up. The guidelines for awarding treasure, meanwhile, have you give the party items 1 level higher than the PCs. This means the items found on adventures are more powerful than those a PC could make (which are capped at the PC's level). The treasure assignment is measured across a level instead of per encounter because some encounters won't have treasure, some will have extra treasure, and some treasure hoards or rewards might be found outside encounters entirely. If your campaign structure works better by giving out treasure for individual encounters—such as some dungeon crawls or sandbox games—see @UUID[.oBOw6E6V7ncrB1rN]{Treasure Per Encounter}.</p>\n<p>As you choose treasure, look at the flow of treasure in the campaign, and see which PCs are ahead and which are behind. It's usually best to mix “core items,” treasure linked to a PC's main abilities, with treasure that has unusual, less broadly applicable powers. For instance, a champion might not purchase <em>plate armor of the deep</em>, but they will likely wear it if they find it. These items should always be useful—a party without a primal spellcaster won't have much use for an <em>animal staff</em>. The number of core items to give out depends partly on how much the campaign allows for crafting and buying items.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there are few limits on buying items and there's plenty of time to craft, make about half the permanent items you give out core items. The PCs have plenty of ways to obtain the items they want.</li>\n<li>If purchasing items and obtaining formulas is somewhat difficult, make about three-fourths of the permanent items core items. If a PC really wants an item, they might have to do extra work to get it.</li>\n<li>If there are no magic item shops or other ways to purchase items and formulas, make all the permanent items core items. In this case, it might work better for your game to use @UUID[.SnSGU7DPiogZ9JOr]{Automatic Bonus Progression} to eliminate the need for core items.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Selling Items</h2>\n<p>The PCs' ability to sell items plays a big part in their ability to equip themselves how they want. It's expected that a Pathfinder campaign strives for some amount of verisimilitude—that PCs can't find a buyer for every item, especially if they're selling multiple copies of the same thing. Players should not have the expectation that they can sell whatever they want whenever they want. They might be unable to sell items that wouldn't be in demand, have to take a lower percentage, or have trouble selling items in places without massive wealth.</p>\n<p>If you don't want to deal with that level of detail, you can choose to make selling items more abstract, allowing the PCs to sell anything for half Price essentially at any time. Since this makes it far easier for PCs to outfit themselves how they want, they might be more powerful.</p>",

If you need to select treasure for a single encounter, such as in a sandbox game, you can use the table above. It takes the treasure budget for each level from @UUID[.Ly8l2GT6dbvuY3A2]{Treasure by Level} table and breaks that down per encounter based on the encounter threat, similar to how XP varies by threat. The final column shows extra treasure you should award if you build an entire level this way. Unlike the standard table, this doesn't include items by item level, as the value doesn't cleanly break down for most single encounters. It's recommended you still give out those permanent items, but you'll need to borrow from other encounters' treasure to account for their value. Include encounters against creatures without treasure to account for this.</p>",

This section explains how to build your own subsystems for tracking success via Victory Points. Many other subsystems throughout the chapter use these as well, though often by a different name.</p>\n<p>Victory Points (or VP) are a powerful tool in your GM arsenal, as they allow you to track the PCs' progress using a subsystem to go beyond the results of a single check. Victory Points are versatile; you could track and resolve them within a single encounter, or you could collect them over the course of an entire campaign to determine the ending of the story.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Enemy Victory Points</h3>\n<p>In addition to giving both the PCs and enemies Victory Points, as mentioned on page 149, sometimes it makes more sense to have only the enemies gain or lose Victory Points instead of the PCs. Even though the NPCs are also taking actions, it's usually best to increase or reduce the enemy's Victory Points based on just the PCs' actions, since it maximizes the feeling of player agency. In some rare cases where the foes act directly against the PCs, you might have both PC and foe actions increase the foe's Victory Points.</p>\n<p>Implementing such a subsystem might mean flipping the normal rolls. For instance, if the PCs were trying to lower their enemies' Influence over a faction, a critical success by a PC would lower the Influence by 2, a success would lower the Influence by 1, and a critical failure might give the enemies something to exploit, raising their Influence by 1. This uses the same effects as an accumulating roll, but “damages” the enemies' VP instead of gaining VP for the PCs' side. While this is very similar mechanically to the PCs gaining VP, the thematic connection is much stronger for an intrigue-based story.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Naming Your Victory Points</h2>\n<p>It can be fun to rename your Victory Points, to better reflect the subsystem they track. The term “Victory Points” is unspecific, so you can create a name for your Victory Points that fits the theme of your adventure and helps the players feel more like they are taking part in the type of activity your subsystem represents. Examples of renamed VPs include Influence Points (page 151), Infiltration Points (page 160), Research Points (page 154), and Reputation Points (page 164). The name should be representative, and the PCs should understand what it refers to. You can leave off the word “Points” if you prefer, though this section often retains it while describing how Victory Points can be used.</p>\n<h2>Victory Point Subsystem Structure</h2>\n<p>There are a few common structures for tracking Victory Points that you might use for your new subsystem. You could come up with a structure based off one of the subsystems below, or you could create your own completely different structure if none of them match the way you're running your game. The most important thing is to consider how the PCs or their opposition gain or lose various forms of Victory Points.</p>\n<h3>Accumulating Victory Points</h3>\n<p>The most common structure is to accumulate Victory Points toward a total, either stopping after reaching a success threshold or collecting as many Victory Points as possible in a given time frame and then measuring the results against various thresholds. The influence subsystem on page 151 is a great example of this structure in action: each PC has a certain number of chances to influence various NPCs, and after reaching a particular threshold of Victory Points with an NPC, the PCs have convinced that NPC.</p>\n<p>In a variation of this structure, the PCs' adversaries can also accumulate Victory Points, giving the PCs a moving target—either to reach the goal before the adversary or to have more Victory Points than the adversary at the end of a given time frame. This is a great structure for you to use in a situation where the PCs face opposition rather than having the PCs accumulate Victory Points while adversaries decrease the total, since it's dynamic and less at risk of resulting in a stalemate.</p>\n<p>You can track a subsystem at a larger scale, like over the course of an adventure or campaign, by granting the PCs Victory Points for achieving difficult goals or making particular decisions. Such subsystems usually ask the PCs to compare their accumulated Victory Points against several ranked tiers that each having varying results on the story. Typically these results become more positive for the PCs as they acquire more Victory Points, but sometimes succeeding too fully could have unintended consequences, like convincing the workers to support a rebellion so thoroughly that it riles up a mob. If you're making your own subsystem, you might not define these ranks in full, but just use your best guess at the end.</p>\n<h4>Accumulating Rolls</h4>\n<p>In cases where the PCs need to make checks to gain Victory Points, the amount they get for the degrees of success is up to you. The default scale detailed below works in most cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The PCs gain 2 Victory Points.</p><p><strong>Success </strong>The PCs gain 1 Victory Point.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure </strong>The PCs lose 1 Victory Point. This means that the result of a PC's check usually results in the party gaining either 1 or no Victory Points. However, specialized PCs have a solid chance of earning the party 2 Victory Points, and hare‑brained schemes have a fair chance of losing the PCs 1 Victory Point.</p>\n<h3>Diminishing Victory Points</h3>\n<p>Using this method, the PCs start with a certain number of Victory Points, and rather than accumulating them, they attempt to avoid losing them. Perhaps the PCs are trying to keep dragon eggs from cracking, or are otherwise attempting to minimize damage, loss, or danger. This variant is less common, but it's great at conveying the urgency of a situation as the PCs lose points. Sometimes it's necessary to add that sense of tension with this subsystem! Typically, when the PCs lose all their Victory Points, a negative event occurs. If they're on a timer, the final results might be better the more points they manage to keep before the time runs out.</p>\n<h4>Diminishing Rolls</h4>\n<p>Using this structure, the PCs typically lose Victory Points as a result of failed checks, though they can still lose them for making particularly poor decisions or behaving recklessly. Once again, you can use any scaling consequences that make sense, but the default degrees of success are as follows.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> If regaining ground is possible, the PCs gain 1 Victory Point. Otherwise, as success.</p><p><strong>Success </strong>The PCs avoid losing any Victory Points.</p><p><strong>Failure </strong>The PCs lose 1 Victory Point.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure </strong>The PCs lose 2 Victory Points.</p>\n<h3>Multiple Point Subsystems</h3>\n<p>In a multiple point subsystem, you have more than one point system, each measuring something different. For example, in a long-distance race, the PCs and their opponents both try to gain their own Marathon Points, and whoever gets to 10 points first wins!</p>\n<p>Infiltration on page 160 offers a different example of a Victory Point subsystem with multiple types of points. PCs try to get a certain number of Infiltration Points to successfully infiltrate a location while avoiding giving Awareness Points to their enemies through failure.</p>\n<p>Consider combining the multiple points with a time factor, like in infiltrations, where the PCs automatically accrue Awareness Points over time at a slow rate.</p>\n<h2>Obstacles and DCs</h2>\n<p>When preparing your subsystem, think of the obstacles PCs might face or avenues they can exploit when engaging in your subsystem. Set some DCs for them in advance, using the normal system for setting DCs. Everything else, you can improvise on the spot. If you think your DCs will be higher overall, when you set the number of points needed, choose a value on the lower end (see Setting your Scale below).</p>\n<p>Think of some possibilities that are much easier and some that are harder. Who are your PCs opposing, and what weak points might that opposition have that the PCs could exploit? Set those DCs lower or make overcoming them grant more VP. PCs who do their research or come up with clever strategies should find it easier to overcome the challenge.</p>\n<h2>Setting Your Scale</h2>\n<p>The number of points it takes to reach a goal will greatly affect how your subsystem feels during play. If you want the subsystem to be used for a single scene, such as one negotiation with a powerful NPC, set the number lower than if it's meant to take up most or all of a game session. The Table 3-1 (page 150) suggests possible values for your Victory Point scale. The “adventure-wide” scale is for subsystems that are part of a larger narrative, granting Victory Points when the PCs overcome entire encounters or dungeons, rather than as an encounter unfolds.</p>\n<p>This larger scale is intended for subsystems that take a lot of the party's focus. A subsystem that runs in the background during an adventure should use a smaller scale. This is usually the “adventure-wide, sideline” value. It could be even lower, such as if you have a dungeon-based adventure including several opportunities to interact with a kobold tribe to get some small benefits. Though they appear throughout the adventure, you would use a lower value because attaining the VP is a minor part of the story. In fact, you might choose not to use a VP subsystem at all.</p>\n<p>The table also lists numbers for one or more thresholds. These are the point values at which the PCs get a partial benefit (or, for a diminishing subsystem, take a drawback). You should grant partial benefits when the PCs reach a certain threshold or introduce twists to the subsystem to ensure they continue to feel engaged and rewarded over time.</p>\n<table><caption><strong>Table: Victory Point Scales</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Duration of Challenge</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>VP End Point</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>VP Thresholds</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Quick encounter</td>\n<td>3-5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Long encounter</td>\n<td>7-10</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Most of a session</td>\n<td>15-25</td>\n<td>5, 10, 15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adventure-wide, sideline</td>\n<td>15-20</td>\n<td>5, 10, 15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adventure-wise, forefront</td>\n<td>25-50</td>\n<td>10, 20, 30, 40</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The values also depend on various factors. These might include the DCs, the number of chances the PCs get to gain Victory Points, and the flexibility of how the PCs can deploy themselves (for example, if PCs are all forced to try something they might not be trained in, it could cause critical failures). They might also include the amount of effort the PCs need to spend on tasks that don't directly earn Victory Points—such as checks to Discover information about NPCs using the Influence subsystem. Keep all these in mind when deciding what end point you want to use.</p>\n<h2>Running Your Subsystem</h2>\n<p>When running your new subsystem, be sure to keep the challenges fresh by using a variety of different skills and options to encourage creativity and cooperation, rather than just using the same check over and over again, where PCs can expect diminishing returns. You can also use timers to encourage each PC to participate or even create mechanics that directly encourage each PC to participate, like setting penalties for the same PC attempting checks repeatedly, or for two PCs attempting the same check.</p>\n<p>You can even have challenges that require all the PCs to participate. For instance, if the party's host is welcoming every guest individually, each PC might have to make an impression in their own way, or during infiltration, each PC might have to test their ability to Impersonate or Sneak. You'll likely find that some approaches should be automatic successes if they're well-suited to the task, or automatic failures for ideas that are likely impossible.</p>\n<h2>Rewards</h2>\n<p>How you structure rewards for your subsystem depends greatly on its scope. A subsystem resolved in a single sitting usually gives accomplishment XP unless it is particularly demanding, in which case it could be considered a full-scale encounter. Meanwhile, subsystems that span over the course of multiple sessions or the entire campaign might generate accomplishment XP at meaningful milestones along the way. If you have a long-spanning subsystem that's fairly low profile and behind the scenes or is not success-oriented, such as a subsystem to track what type of ruler the PCs' patron will become based on the PCs' decisions, you might not give XP directly from the subsystem, since in that case “success” is undefined.</p>",

An attached weapon can be affixed to an item with 10 minutes of work and a successful @Check[type:crafting|dc:10] check; this includes the time needed to remove the weapon from a previous item, if necessary. If an item is destroyed, its attached weapon can usually be salvaged.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backstabber</td>\n<td>When you hit a flat-footed creature, this weapon deals 1 precision damage in addition to its normal damage. The precision damage increases to 2 if the weapon is a +3 weapon.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backswing</td>\n<td>You can use the momentum from a missed attack with this weapon to lead into your next attack.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brutal</td>\n<td>A ranged attack with this trait uses its Strength modifier instead of Dexterity on the attack roll.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Climbing</td>\n<td>The hand holding this weapon is freely available to Climb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Concealable</td>\n<td>This weapon is designed to be inconspicuous or easily concealed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks and DCs to hide or conceal a weapon with this trait.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deadly</td>\n<td>On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a greater striking rune and three dice if the weapon has a major striking rune. Roll this after doubling the weapon's damage.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Disarm</td>\n<td>You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fatal</td>\n<td>The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weapon's damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Finesse</td>\n<td>You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Forceful</td>\n<td>This weapon becomes more dangerous as you build momentum. When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and each subsequent attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Free-hand</td>\n<td>This weapon doesn't take up your hand, usually because it is built into your armor. A free-hand weapon can't be Disarmed. You can use the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on. You can't attack with a free-hand weapon if you're wielding anything in that hand or otherwise using that hand. When you're not wielding anything and not otherwise using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to have a hand free as well as those that require you to be wielding a weapon in that hand. Each of your hands can have only one free-hand weapon on it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Grapple</td>\n<td>You can use this weapon to Grapple with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hampering</td>\n<td>A weapon with the hampering trait is designed to be shaken, cast outward, or whipped about to control space on the battlefield. You can use an Interact action to thrash the weapon in a square within the weapon's reach. That square becomes difficult terrain until you attack with the weapon, move, or would otherwise stop intentionally thrashing it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jousting</td>\n<td>The weapon is suited for mounted combat with a harness or similar means. When mounted, if you moved at least 10 feet on the action before your attack, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that attack equal to the number of damage dice for the weapon. In addition, while mounted, you can wield the weapon in one hand, changing the damage die to the listed value.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Modular</td>\n<td>The weapon has multiple configurations that you can switch between using an Interact action. Typically, switching between configurations of a modular weapon allows it to deal different types of damage (listed in the trait, such as “modular B, P, or S”), though it's possible for a modular weapon's description to list more complicated configurations.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nonlethal</td>\n<td>Attacks with this weapon are nonlethal, and are used to knock creatures unconscious instead of kill them. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a -2 circumstance penalty.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Parry</td>\n<td>This weapon can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your proficiency with it is trained or better, you can spend an Interact action to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Propulsive</td>\n<td>You add half your Strength modifier (if positive) to damage rolls with a propulsive ranged weapon. If you have a negative Strength modifier, you add your full Strength modifier instead.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Range</td>\n<td>These attacks will either list a finite range or a range increment, which follows the normal rules for range increments.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ranged trip</td>\n<td>This weapon can be used to Trip with the Athletics skill at a distance up to the weapon's first range increment. The skill check takes a -2 circumstance penalty. You can add the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the check. As with using a melee weapon to trip, a ranged trip doesn't deal any damage when used to Trip. This trait usually only appears on a thrown weapon.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reach</td>\n<td>Weapons with this trait are long and can be used to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reload</td>\n<td>While all weapons need some amount of time to get into position, many ranged weapons also need to be loaded and reloaded. This entry indicates how many Interact actions it takes to reload such weapons. This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and firing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, the GM determines whether they must be performed together as an activity, or you can spend some of those actions during one turn and the rest during your next turn.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repeating</td>\n<td>A repeating weapon is typically a type of crossbow that has a shorter reload time. These weapons can't be loaded with individual bolts like other crossbows; instead, they require a magazine of specialized ammunition to be loaded into a special slot. Once that magazine is in place, the ammunition is automatically loaded each time the weapon is cocked to fire, reducing its reload to the value in its reload entry (typically 0). When the ammunition runs out, a new magazine must be loaded, which requires a free hand and 3 Interact actions (to remove the old magazine, retrieve the new magazine, and slot the new magazine in place). These actions don't need to be consecutive.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shove</td>\n<td>You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sweep</td>\n<td>This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tethered</td>\n<td>This weapon is attached to a length of rope or chain that allows you to retrieve it after it has left your hand. If you have a free hand while wielding this weapon, you can use an Interact action to pull the weapon back into your grasp after you have thrown it as a ranged attack or after it has been disarmed (unless it is being held by another creature).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thrown</td>\n<td>You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack, and it is a ranged weapon when thrown. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment specified in the weapon's Range entry.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trip</td>\n<td>You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Twin</td>\n<td>These weapons are used as a pair, complementing each other. When you attack with a twin weapon, you add a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon's number of damage dice if you have previously attacked with a different weapon of the same type this turn. The weapons must be of the same type to benefit from this trait, but they don't need to have the same runes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Two-hand</td>\n<td>This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This change applies to all the weapon's damage dice, such as those from striking runes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unarmed</td>\n<td>An unarmed attack uses your body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn't a weapon, though it's categorized with weapons for weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Since it's part of your body, an unarmed attack can't be Disarmed. It also doesn't take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage follows the same rules as a free-hand weapon.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Versatile</td>\n<td>A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than that listed in the Damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon that is versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Volley</td>\n<td>This ranged weapon is less effective at close distances. Your attacks against targets that are at a distance within the range listed take a -2 penalty.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
