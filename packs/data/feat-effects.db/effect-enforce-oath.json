You immediately stop Enforcing your Oath if you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Unconscious]{Unconscious} or if the chosen creature goes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Unnoticed]{Unnoticed} by you for more than 1 minute. You can also stop Enforcing your Oath at any time during your turn as a free action.</p>"
