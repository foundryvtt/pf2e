While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are those using longbows, shortbows, or bows with the monk trait.</p>\n<p>You can use @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Flurry of Blows]{Flurry of Blows} with these bows. You can use your other monk feats or monk abilities that normally require unarmed attacks with these bows when attacking within half the first range increment (normally 50 feet for a longbow and 30 feet for a shortbow), so long as the feat or ability doesn't require a single, specific Strike.</p>"
