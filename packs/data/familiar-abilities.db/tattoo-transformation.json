When transformed into a tattoo, the familiar looks like a colorful and stylized version of itself and can't act except to turn back into a familiar. It isn't affected by area effects and must be targeted separately to affect it, which requires knowledge that it's a creature. This means you and your allies can heal or assist the familiar while most enemies stay unaware of its true nature. Creatures must attempt a <span data-pf2-check=\"perception\" data-pf2-traits=\"\" data-pf2-label=\"\" data-pf2-dc=\"20\" data-pf2-show-dc=\"all\">Perception</span> check to Seek to realize a tattoo is actually a familiar (which few foes will try).
