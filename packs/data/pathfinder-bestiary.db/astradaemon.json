            "flavorText": "<p>These unnerving, almost reptilian daemons represent death by direct assault against a soul or life-force-the same numbing death they bring with their fell touch. Rarely seen on the Material Plane, astradaemons spend most of their time hunting the pathways between the living world and the afterlife. There, they capture migrating souls, snatching them from their rightful rewards or punishments and dragging them to Abaddon as tribute to their undying masters. These horrifying predators of the dead can also be found stalking the banks of the River of Souls in the Astral Plane, where they constantly hunt for new victims. Psychopomps have a particular hatred of astradaemons as a result, and clashes between them and these eerie hunters of the recently departed are indeed the stuff of legend.</p>\n<p>Not all astradaemons limit their hunt to souls. The most notorious of their kind serve the Horsemen themselves as assassins.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Denizens of the bleak and terrible plane of Abaddon, daemons are shaped by and devoted to the destruction of life in all its forms. They seek the death of every mortal being by the most painful and horrible means possible, all in service to the apocalyptic entities known as the Four Horsemen. Each kind of daemon represents a different way to die, and their powers are nearly always aimed at spreading that particular form of death. Through the use of these powers, they seek to drag all existence down into a pit of hopelessness and despair, and to commit all souls to oblivion.</p>\n<p>While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures' destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals' fear.</p>\n<p>While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods-not least of which is the cacodaemons' soul gems-to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual \"resource.\"</p>",
