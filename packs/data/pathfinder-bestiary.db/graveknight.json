            "flavorText": "<p>Graveknights are undead warriors granted unlife by a cursed suit of armor.</p>\n<h3>Creating Graveknights</h3>\n<p>You can turn an existing, living creature into a graveknight by completing the following steps. It's best to build a graveknight from scratch, but if you don't have the time, simply apply the template. A creature should be at least level 5 before being converted to a graveknight.</p>\n<p>Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase its attack rolls, AC, saving throws, Perception, and skills by 1, its HP by 5, and its Strike damage by 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Graveknight Abilities</h4>\n<p>A graveknight gains the undead and graveknight traits, and its alignment is usually adjusted to evil. It loses any abilities that come from it being a living creature and any traits that represent its life, such as human and humanoid.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Darkvision]{Darkvision}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Negative Healing]{Negative Healing}</p>\n<p><strong>Rejuvenation</strong> (divine, necromancy) When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds its body over the course of [[/r 1d10 #days]]{1d10 days}-or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host (see Graveknight Armor, below). If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts. A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with disintegrate), transporting it to the Positive Energy Plane, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano.</p>\n<p><strong>Immunities</strong> death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious, plus one energy type (the same chosen for ruinous weapons below).</p>\n<p><strong>Sacrilegious Aura</strong> (abjuration, aura, divine, evil) @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Aura]{Aura} 30 feet.</p>\n<p>When a creature in the aura uses a positive spell or ability, the graveknight automatically attempts to counteract it, with the listed counteract modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Devastating Blast</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> (arcane, evocation) The graveknight unleashes a 30-foot cone of energy. Creatures in the area take 1d12 damage, plus an additional 1d12 damage for every two levels the graveknight has (basic Reflex save). The graveknight can use this ability once every [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}. This energy damage is of the same type as that of its ruinous weapons (see below); Devastating Blast gains the associated energy trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Phantom Mount</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">3</span> (arcane, conjuration, summon) The graveknight summons a supernatural mount as per phantom steed, heightened to a level equal to half the graveknight's level. Unlike phantom steed, the steed's AC and saving throw bonuses are all 4 lower than the graveknight's, and the steed has one-third the graveknight's Hit Points (rounded down). If the steed is destroyed, the graveknight must wait 1 hour before using this ability again.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruinous Weapons</strong> At the time of its creation, a raveknight chooses one of the following energy types that was relevant to its life or death: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Any weapon the graveknight wields gains the effects of the caustic, frost, shock, or flaming weapon rune, respectively, in addition to a +1 striking weapon rune. If the graveknight is 14th level or higher, its weapons instead gain the effects of the greater versions of both of these runes.</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon Master</strong> The graveknight has access to the critical specialization effects of any weapons it wields.</p>\n<h4>Alternate Graveknight Abilities</h4>\n<p>Although the abilities listed above are standard for a graveknight, you can create a more unusual graveknight by substituting one of the aforementioned abilities (except for its rejuvenation ability) with one of the following.</p>\n<p><strong>Betrayed Revivification</strong> The graveknight died after being deeply betrayed. Instead of being immune to a type of energy damage, it is immune to mental damage, its weapons deal 1d6 additional mental damage, and its Devastating Blast deals mental damage with a Will saving throw instead of Reflex.</p>\n<p><strong>Create Grave Squire</strong> The graveknight can gift a piece of its armor to a willing ally, which becomes its grave squire. The graveknight can communicate telepathically with its squire at any distance, see through the squire's senses, and cast suggestion as a divine innate spell through the telepathic link at will; the squire treats its degree of success as one step worse. If the graveknight's main armor is destroyed, the squire's piece expands to cover the squire's body over [[/br 1d10 #days]]{1d10 days}, after which point it becomes the graveknight's new body. The graveknight can have only one squire at a time, and must recover the gifted piece of armor if it wishes to create a new squire.</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Deliverance</strong> The graveknight has positive resistance equal to its level.</p>\n<h3>Graveknight Armor</h3>\n<p>Wearing graveknight armor is very risky, for the graveknight's essence rapidly parasitizes the new wearer, accelerating the graveknight's rejuvenation. This agonizing transformation inevitably kills the host, transforming their flesh into the graveknight's new body. Removing the curse allows a character to remove the armor, but if it ever wears the armor again, the curse returns. If the wearer dies from another cause while wearing the armor, or if the graveknight's rejuvenation completes before the wearer dies from the curse, the wearer immediately progresses to stage 3.</p>\n<p><strong>Graveknight's Curse</strong> (arcane, curse, necromancy) This curse affects anyone who wears a graveknight's armor for at least 1 hour.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will save;</p>\n<p><strong>Onset</strong> 1 hour;</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Doomed]{Doomed 1} and cannot remove the armor (1 day);</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Doomed]{Doomed 2}, speed penalty of -10 feet, and cannot remove the armor (1 day);</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong> dies and transforms into the armor's graveknight.</p>",
