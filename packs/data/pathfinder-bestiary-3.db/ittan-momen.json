Most tsukumogami are, by nature, mischievous, and oftentimes want nothing more than to occupy the attention of living creatures.</p>\n<p>Tsukumogami can commonly be found in areas with a strong cultural belief in the value of caring for objects, which helps items survive long enough to become tsukumogami. Towns and villages with large tsukumogami populations are referred to as \"sleepless towns\" due to the nightly tsukumogami celebrations, which can become so raucous that they prevent the living residents from sleeping peacefully.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Born from large pieces of cloth, ittan-momen flutter in the air, catching the last rays of the setting sun.

The monster can attempt to Engulf the same creature only once in a single use of Engulf. The monster can contain as many creatures as can fit in its space.</p>\n<p>A creature that fails its save is pulled into the monster's body. It is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Grabbed]{Grabbed}, is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Slowed]{Slowed 1}, and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The creature takes the listed amount of damage when first engulfed and at the end of each of its turns while it's engulfed. An engulfed creature can get free by @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Escape]{Escaping} against the listed escape DC. An engulfed creature can attack the monster engulfing it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The engulfing creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either method can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.</p>\n<p>If the monster dies, all creatures it has engulfed are automatically released as the monster's form loses cohesion.</p>"
