Tsukumogami range from harmless to malicious, each individual personality a result of how the object was treated before its awakening. Well-cared-for objects tend to birth helpful, friendly tsukumogami, while mistreated or abandoned objects twist into malevolent and violent beings. Most tsukumogami are, by nature, mischievous, and oftentimes want nothing more than to occupy the attention of living creatures.</p>\n<p>Tsukumogami can commonly be found in areas with a strong cultural belief in the value of caring for objects, which helps items survive long enough to become tsukumogami. Towns and villages with large tsukumogami populations are referred to as \"sleepless towns\" due to the nightly tsukumogami celebrations, which can become so raucous that they prevent the living residents from sleeping peacefully.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Born from large pieces of cloth, ittan-momen flutter in the air, catching the last rays of the setting sun.
