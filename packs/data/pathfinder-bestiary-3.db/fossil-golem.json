Not bound to any specific model, fossil golems are crafted to be as terrifying as possible instead of models of anatomic accuracy. As such, most fossil golems are nightmarish saurian amalgams whose massive arms end with the complete skulls of apex predators like tyrannosauruses, their bite enhanced to petrify flesh.</p>\n<p>The enchantments that animate fossil golems grant them a form of modular flexibility, letting them trade mobility for extended reach through the rapid rearrangement of their limbs. This also lets them appear like a jumbled mass of bones at rest, making them likely to be mistaken for decor rather than guardians.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Powerful constructs that blend magic and raw material, golems make ideal guardians and bodyguards, with forms and functions as varied as the needs of those who employ them. As their crafters experiment with more exotic components and create new formulas, golems with surprising abilities emerge.</p>",
