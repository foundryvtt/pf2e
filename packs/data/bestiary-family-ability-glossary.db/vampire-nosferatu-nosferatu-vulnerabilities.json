            "value": "<ul>\n<li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A nosferatu can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the nosferatu involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Fleeing]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a nosferatu can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:25|traits:concentrate] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for [[/br 1d6 #Overcome Revulsions]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li>\n<li><strong>Stake</strong> A magical wooden stake (such as one affected by a weapon potency rune, magic weapon, or similar magic) driven through the nosferatu's heart drops the nosferatu to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a nosferatu requires 3 actions and works only if the nosferatu is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Unconscious]{Unconscious}. If the stake is removed, the nosferatu can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the nosferatu's head is severed and anointed with <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Holy Water]{Holy Water}</em> while the stake is in place, the nosferatu is destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Sunlight</strong> If exposed to direct sunlight, a nosferatu immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Slowed]{Slowed 1}. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the nosferatu ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight. If the nosferatu loses all their actions in this way, they're destroyed.</li>\n</ul>"
