If the lich's body is destroyed, the lich can control this animated object directly, although they can't cast any spells while inside the vessel. The lich's body is often restored inside this object, being ejected from the animated object after 1d10 days in the normal manner for a <em>soul cage</em>. The animated object is usually at least 4 levels lower than the lich, but it doesn't engage in combat unless directly threatened or if the lich is in control of it.</p>"
