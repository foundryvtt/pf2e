It then Strides up to double its Speed. It can move through spaces occupied by other creatures, and this movement doesn't trigger reactions. Creatures the bone storm moves through take [[/r 1d6[slashing]]] damage for every 2 levels of the skeleton, with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:|basic:true] save against the hard DC for the creature's level. A level 1 or lower skeleton only moves; it doesn't deal damage. A creature attempts this save only once even if the bone storm moved through its space multiple times. At the end of the movement, the skeleton reforms.</p>"
