            "value": "<p>All vampires possess the following weaknesses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compulsions</strong> Vampires are creatures of strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions-a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion.</li>\n<li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Fleeing]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:25|name:Overcome Revulsion] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for [[/br 1d6 #rounds]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li>\n<li><strong>Stake</strong> A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Holy Water]{Holy Water}</em> while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Sunlight</strong> If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Slowed]{Slowed 1}. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors.</li>\n</ul>"
