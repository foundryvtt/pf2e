This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1}, and the vetalarana regains HP equal to 10% of the vetalarana's maximum HP, gaining any excess as temporary Hit Points. Draining Thoughts from a creature that is already stupefied doesn't restore any HP to the vetalarana but increases the victim's stupefied value by 1. Additionally, the vetalarana views one of the victim's memories.</p>\n<p>A victim's stupefied condition value decreases by 1 every week.</p>\n<p>A victim that becomes stupefied 5 in this way is rendered comatose, becoming permanently @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Unconscious]{Unconscious}. As long as the vetalarana lives, a comatose victim can't regain consciousness, and its stupefied condition doesn't decrease.</p>"
