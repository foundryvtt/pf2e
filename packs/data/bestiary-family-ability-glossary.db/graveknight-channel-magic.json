The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into an attack instead. The graveknight then makes a melee Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack. The spell is coupled with the attack, using the attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell.</p>\n<p>This counts as two attacks for the graveknight's multiple attack penalty but doesn't apply the penalty until after it's completed Channeling Magic.</p>\n<p>The graveknight can't use Channel Magic again for [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>"
