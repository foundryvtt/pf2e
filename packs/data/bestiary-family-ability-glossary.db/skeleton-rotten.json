The skeleton loses its resistance to piercing and slashing damage and is surrounded by a horrific stench in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10]{10-foot aura}. A creature entering or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:] save against the standard DC of the skeleton's level or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened 1} (plus @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Slowed]{Slowed 1} for as long as it remains sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, affected creatures take a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>This stench remains for 1 hour after the rotten skeleton has been destroyed unless the bones are burned, or the rot is washed away with at least 1 gallon of water.</p>"
