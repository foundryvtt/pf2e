The jiang-shi is immune to spells cast from a magic item without expending a spell slot, such as from a scroll or wand. A creature can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Steal]{Steal} the fulu to remove it, rolling against the jiangshi's Perception DC. This immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a creature then destroys the removed fulu with an Interact action, the jiang-shi also loses their @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Fast Healing]{Fast Healing} ability. A jiang-shi can create a replacement fulu by spending 1 uninterrupted hour inscribing a strip of paper (or similar) with a writing instrument.</p>"
