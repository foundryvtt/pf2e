On a failure, the lich siphons the soul from the dying creature, storing it in a black mote of energy that orbits the lich's skull. The creature can't be brought back from the dead while its soul is trapped in this way. Once per day, as a single action, the lich can consume a mote to heal a number of Hit Points equal to double the soul's level. This utterly destroys the soul, making the creature impossible to bring back to life without a wish, miracle, or similar magic. The lich can have a number of motes orbiting them equal to their Charisma modifier (to a minimum of one mote); if the lich gains an additional mote, the oldest one is released, its soul free to travel to the afterlife.</p>"
