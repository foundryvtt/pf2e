The creature must succeed at a @Check[type:reflex|dc:21|name:Mycelial Tomb] save or inhale Melfesh spores that remain in its body for 1 minute, be encased in mycelia, and be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Slowed]{Slowed 2}. The mycelia have Hardness 8 and 16 HP, and the DC to Force them Open is 21. Breaking the mycelia frees the creature and ends the slowed effect. If someone other than the encased creatures breaks the mycelia from the outside, the creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stunned]{Stunned 1} and takes any damage dealt by the breaking effect in excess of the mycelia's Hit Points. This replaces the Envelop ability.</p>"
