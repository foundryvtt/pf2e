While doing so makes it significantly more vulnerable, the moment the lich's body is destroyed, it can take over the body of the familiar. After 1 hour, the lich can use this body to cast spells, assuming it has an appendage capable of making somatic components. After [[/br 1d10 #days]]{1d10 days}, the lich's body reforms as normal.</p>"
