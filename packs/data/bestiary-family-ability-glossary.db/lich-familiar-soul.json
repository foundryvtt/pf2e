Instead of a traditional <em>soul cage</em>, this lich stores their soul in the body of their undead familiar. While doing so makes it significantly more vulnerable, the moment the lich's body is destroyed, it can take over the body of the familiar. After 1 hour, the lich can use this body to cast spells, assuming it has an appendage capable of making somatic components. After [[/r 1d10 #days]]{1d10 days}, the lich's body reforms as normal.</p>"
