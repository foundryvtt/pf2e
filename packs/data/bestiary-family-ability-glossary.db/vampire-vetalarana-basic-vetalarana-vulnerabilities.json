Such barriers can prevent the transference of a vetalarana's mind through Mental Rebirth.</li>\n<li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vetalarana delights in consuming memories and secrets, and is disgusted by those who share such sensitive tidbits openly. A vetalarana can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a creature loudly voicing their intimate personal secrets or most cherished memories aloud. Speaking such information aloud with conviction is a single action that has the auditory, concentrate, and linguistic traits, and protects the creature until the start of its next turn. A vetalarana that involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a creature sharing such information gains the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Fleeing]{Fleeing} condition until they're 10 feet or farther from the creature. After 1 round of being exposed to the secrets of a creature, a vetalarana can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:25] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for [[/r 1d6 #rounds]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li>\n<li><strong>Vulnerable to Brain Destruction</strong> A vetalarana whose brain has been destroyed, or is reduced to 0 HP while unable to take mental actions, can't use Mental Rebirth.</li>\n</ul>"
