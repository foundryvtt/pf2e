This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Drained]{Drained 1} (@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Drained]{Drained 2} if a vrykolakas master uses this action), and the vrykolakas regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.</p>\n<p>The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful @Check[type:medicine|dc:20|name:Blood Transfusion] check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.</p>"
