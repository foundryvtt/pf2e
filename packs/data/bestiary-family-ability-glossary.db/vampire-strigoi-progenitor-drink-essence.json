This requires an @Check[type:athletics] check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Drained]{Drained 2} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 2}, and the strigoi regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of).</p>\n<p>A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful @Check[type:medicine|dc:20] check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely.</p>"
