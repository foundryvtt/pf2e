This damage is either positive or negative, determined by the patron deity's divine font (chosen at the divine warden's creation if the deity offers a choice), and this ability gains the corresponding trait. Each creature in the area must attempt a Will save with the following outcomes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature takes half damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes full damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes full damage and becomes temporarily cursed by the patron deity. The creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 day; this is a curse effect that uses the Will save DC as the counteract DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 2} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 2}.</p>"
