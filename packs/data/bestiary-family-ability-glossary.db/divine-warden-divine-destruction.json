The creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 day; this is a curse effect that uses the Will save DC as the counteract DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 2} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 2}.</p>"
