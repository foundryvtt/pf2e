This requires an @Check[type:athletics] check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Drained]{Drained 1} and the jiang-shi regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess as temporary Hit Points. Draining qi from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the jiang-shi but increases the victim's drained condition value by 1, killing the victim when it reaches drained 5. If the victim has the ability to cast ki spells, it can spend 1 Focus Point to avoid becoming drained. This protects it only from the current attack, not from subsequent attempts to Drain Qi.</p>\n<p>A victim's drained condition value decreases by 1 every week. If the creature restricts their diet to glutinous rice for at least 1 day and spends 10 minutes dancing, jogging, or otherwise engaging in vigorous physical activity by succeeding at a @Check[type:athletics|dc:25] check, it reduces its drained condition by 1.</p>"
