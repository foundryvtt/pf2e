            "value": "<p>The Melfesh Monster injects a creature's corpse with spores over the course of 10 minutes, priming it to explode. These spores last 1 day, and the Melfesh Monster can only have three corpses primed at a time; if it primes another, the oldest corpse bomb deactivates harmlessly. Creatures that succeed at a @Check[type:perception|dc:21|name:Notice Corpse Bomb|traits:action:seek,action:investigate,secret] check while Seeking or Investigating notice a corpse bomb's explosive nature. Creatures can attempt to disarm a corpse bomb with a @Check[type:nature|dc:21|name:Disable Corpse Bomb (Nature)|traits:action:disable-a-device], @Check[type:survival|dc:21|name:Disable Corpse Bomb (Survival)|traits:action:disable-a-device], or @Check[type:thievery|dc:21|name:Disable Corpse Bomb (Thievery)|traits:action:disable-a-device] check to Disable a Device. A corpse bomb explodes in a @Template[type:burst|distance:10] if a creature comes within 5 feet or if the Melfesh Monster detonates it as a single action, which it can use once per round. This deals [[/r {2d8[fire],2d8[poison]}]]{2d8 fire and 2d8 poison damage} (@Check[type:reflex|dc:21|basic:true|name:Corpse Bomb] save) and leaves a lingering, 10-foot-radius spore cloud. A creature that enters or begins its turn within the cloud inhales spores, which remain in its body for 1 minute. This ability replaces Spore Cloud.</p>"
