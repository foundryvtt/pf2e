If even a single worm escapes, the worm that walks will eventually re-form using a process that typically takes [[/r 1d10 #days]]{1d10 days}.</p>\n<p>While the exact circumstances and surroundings determine how long the worm that walks's foes have to dispatch the fleeing worms before they escape, usually its foes have only a single round.</p>\n<p>Typically, this requires the application of an area effect or splash weapon within 1 round to the space where the worm that walks collapsed. After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing the damage must attempt a <span data-pf2-check=\"flat\" data-pf2-dc=\"15\" data-pf2-show-dc=\"owner\">Flat Check</span>. Each subsequent area or splash damage effect performed on the area reduces the DC of this flat check by 2, to a minimum of DC 5. If any of these flat checks succeed, none of the worms escape, and the worm that walks is destroyed permanently.</p>\n<p>At the GM's discretion, clever means of trapping or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to finish off the worm that walks.</p>"
