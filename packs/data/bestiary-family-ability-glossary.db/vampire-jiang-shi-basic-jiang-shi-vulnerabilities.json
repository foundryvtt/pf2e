A creature can Interact with a mirror or handbell to brandish or ring the item for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the jiang-shi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Fleeing]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they are 10 feet or farther from the object. After 1 round of being exposed to the object of their revulsion, a jiang-shi can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:25] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for [[/r 1d6 #rounds]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li>\n<li><strong>Bitter Epiphany</strong> A jiang-shi is afflicted by severe melancholia when reminded of their debased nature and the truth of their existential disconnection from living beings. When a jiang-shi sees an altar with at least 1 Bulk of food offerings to ancestor spirits, they must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:25] save. They are then temporarily immune to Bitter Epiphany for 1 minute.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The jiang-shi is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The jiang-shi is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The jiang-shi is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 2} for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Confused]{Confused} for 1 minute.</p>"
