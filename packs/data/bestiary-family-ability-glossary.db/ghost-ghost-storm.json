The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, blows objects of light Bulk or less around, and pushes larger objects. Squares in the ghost's aura are difficult terrain and flying creatures are always considered to be moving against the wind.</p>\n<p>The ghost can dismiss or resume the wind as an action, which has the concentrate trait.</p>"
