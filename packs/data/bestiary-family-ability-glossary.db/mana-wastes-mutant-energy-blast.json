The mutant gains some sort of physical alteration to their shape that suggests how they trigger their energy blast, be it numerous pustules on their body, an extra limb, or an additional opening in their throat to exhale the blast as a breath weapon. Choose whether the mutant creates a @Template[type:line|distance:60] of energy or a @Template[type:cone|distance:30] of energy when they activate this ability. The energy deals [[/r ((@actor.level)d6)[energy]]]{1d6 damage per level} with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:|basic:true] save. The mutant can't use Energy Blast again for [[/r 1d4 #Energy Blast Recharge]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>"
