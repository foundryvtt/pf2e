On a failure, the creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened 1}, and on a critical failure, the creature also takes a -5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. While within the aura, the creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saves to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to all zombies' putrid stenches for 1 minute.</p>"
