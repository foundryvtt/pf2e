You might take a penalty if you choose an area that's far away.<br /><br />If you're using Seek to search for objects (including secret doors and hazards), you search up to a 10-foot square adjacent to you.

A creature you detect might remain hidden, rather than becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Observed]{Observed}, if you're using an imprecise sense or if an effect (such as @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Invisible]{Invisiblity}) prevents the subject from being observed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> If you were searching for creatures, any undetected or hidden creature you critically succeeded against becomes observed by you.
