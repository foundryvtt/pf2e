In order to prevent fatigue due to repeated casting, you'll likely use this activity only when something out of the ordinary occurs.</p>\n<p>You can instead use this activity to continue @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Sustain a Spell]{Sustain a Spell} or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Sustain an Activation]{Sustain an Activation} with a sustained duration.
