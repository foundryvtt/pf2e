The typical DC is 20, but the GM might adjust this DC for particularly hard or easy tasks. The GM can add any relevant traits to your preparatory action or to your Aid reaction depending on the situation, or even allow you to Aid checks other than skill checks and attack rolls.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You grant your ally a +2 circumstance bonus to the triggering check.
