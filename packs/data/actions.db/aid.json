The typical DC is 20, but the GM might adjust this DC for particularly hard or easy tasks. The GM can add any relevant traits to your preparatory action or to your Aid reaction depending on the situation, or even allow you to Aid checks other than skill checks and attack rolls.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You grant your ally a +2 circumstance bonus to the triggering check. If you're a master with the check you attempted, the bonus is +3, and if you're legendary, it's +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You grant your ally a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering check.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your ally takes a -1 circumstance penalty to the triggering check.</p>"
