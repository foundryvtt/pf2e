That creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} to your allies, rather than @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Undetected]{Undetected}. This works only for allies who can see you and are in a position where they could potentially detect the target. If your allies can't hear or understand you, they must succeed at a Perception check against the creature's Stealth DC or they misunderstand and believe the target is in a different location.</p>"
