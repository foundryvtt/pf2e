Locks of higher qualities might require multiple successes to unlock, since otherwise even an unskilled burglar could easily crack the lock by attempting the check until they rolled a natural 20. If you lack the proper tools, the GM might let you used improvised picks, which are treated as shoddy tools, depending on the specifics of the lock.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You unlock the lock, or you achieve two successes toward opening a complex lock. You leave no trace of your tampering.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You open the lock, or you achieve one success toward opening a complex lock.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You break your tools. Fixing them requires using Crafting to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Repair]{Repair} them or else swapping in @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Thieves' Tools (Replacement Picks)]{Replacement Picks}.</p>"
