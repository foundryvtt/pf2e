Make a melee Strike with your combination weapon, and then attempt a Thievery check with a –5 penalty to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Steal]{Steal} from your target; you can't Steal closely guarded objects or objects that would take a long time to pilfer. You don't need a free hand to attempt to Steal something in this manner. If your Thievery check succeeds, the target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} against your ranged attacks until the start of your next turn, and you don't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by movement or a ranged attack. These effects occur even if your target has no objects to Steal.</p>"
