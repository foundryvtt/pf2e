You cease being hidden if you do anything except Hide, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Sneak]{Sneak}, or Step. If you attempt to Strike a creature, the creature remains @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} against that attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise. The GM might allow you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action without being noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check.</p>\n<p>If a creature uses @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} to make you observed by it, you must successfully Hide to become hidden from it again.</p>"
