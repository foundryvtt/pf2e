The target continues to comply for an amount of time determined by the GM but not exceeding 1 day, at which point the target becomes unfriendly (if they weren't already unfriendly or hostile). However, the target is too scared of you to retaliate - at least in the short term.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but once the target becomes unfriendly, they might decide to act against you-for example, by reporting you to the authorities or assisting your enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target doesn't do what you say, and if they were not already unfriendly or hostile, they become unfriendly.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target refuses to comply, becomes hostile if they weren't already, and can't be Coerced by you for at least 1 week.</p>"
