            "value": "<p>You cast a spell you have prepared or in your repertoire. Casting a Spell is a special activity that takes a variable number of actions depending on the spell, as listed in each spell's stat block. As soon as the spellcasting actions are complete, the spell effect occurs.</p>\n<p>Some spells are cast as a reaction or free action. In those cases, you Cast the Spell as a reaction or free action (as appropriate) instead of as an activity. Such cases will be noted in the spell's stat block-for example, \"[reaction] verbal.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Long Casting</strong> Times Some spells take minutes or hours to cast. The Cast a Spell activity for these spells includes a mix of the listed spell components, but it's not necessary to break down which one you're providing at a given time. You can't use other actions or reactions while casting such a spell, though at the GM's discretion, you might be able to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take a long time, these spells have the exploration trait, and you can't cast them in an encounter. If combat breaks out while you're casting one, your spell is disrupted.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Components</strong> Each spell lists the spell components required to cast it after the action icons or text, such as \"[three-actions] material, somatic, verbal.\" The spell components, described in detail below, add traits and requirements to the Cast a Spell activity. If you can't provide the components, you fail to Cast the Spell.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Material (manipulate)</li>\n<li>Somatic (manipulate)</li>\n<li>Verbal (concentrate)</li>\n<li>Focus (manipulate)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disrupted and Lost Spells</strong> Some abilities and spells can disrupt a spell, causing it to have no effect and be lost. When you lose a spell, you've already expended the spell slot, spent the spell's costs and actions, and used the Cast a Spell activity. If a spell is disrupted during a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Sustain a Spell]{Sustain a Spell} action, the spell immediately ends.</p>"
