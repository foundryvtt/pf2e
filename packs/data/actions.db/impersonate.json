If you're disguised as a specific individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a circumstance bonus based on how well they know the person you're imitating, or the GM might roll a secret Deception check even if you aren't directly interacting with others.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You trick the creature into thinking you're the person you're disguised as.
