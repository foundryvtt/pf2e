The duration of that spell continues until the end of your next turn. Some spells might have slightly different or expanded effects if you sustain them. Sustaining a Spell for more than 10 minutes (100 rounds) ends the spell and makes you fatigued unless the spell lists a different maximum duration (such as \"sustained up to 1 minute\" or \"sustained up to 1 hour\").</p>\n<p>If your Sustain a Spell action is disrupted, the spell immediately ends.</p>"
