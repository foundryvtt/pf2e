If the dragon had a cone-shaped breath weapon, your breath weapon is a @Template[type:cone|distance:30]. If they had a line-shaped breath weapon, your breath weapon is a @Template[type:line|distance:60]. If they had a burst-shaped breath weapon, your breath weapon is a @Template[type:burst|distance:10] within 60 feet. No matter the shape, it deals [[/r (@actor.level)d6]]{1d6 damage per level}, of the same damage type as the dragon's Breath Weapon, with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)|basic:true] save, using the higher of your class DC or spell DC. This action has the same traits as the breath weapon of the dragon you made the pact with.</p>"
