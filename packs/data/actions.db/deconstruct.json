You need the Alchemical Crafting skill feat to deconstruct alchemical items and the Magical Crafting skill feat to deconstruct magic items.</p>\n<p>To Deconstruct an item, you must meet the following requirements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is your level or lower. An item that doesn't list a level is level 0. If the item is 9th level or higher, you must be a master in Crafting, and if it's 16th or higher, you must be legendary.</li>\n<li>The item isn't a cursed item, artifact, or other item that is similarly hard to destroy. The item isn't a consumable item.</li>\n<li>The item has a listed Price.</li>\n<li>You must have an appropriate set of tools and, in many cases, a workshop. For example, you need access to a smithy to deconstruct a metal shield or an alchemist's lab to de-concoct alchemical items.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the start of this process, you must decide if you're using the deconstructed item to build a new, similar item, of if you are simply breaking it down for raw ingredients that can be used at a later date for any item. In either case, this activity takes 1 day to perform, but if you're using the item to create a new, similar item, that day can be counted as one of the crafting days for the new item.</p>\n<p>At the end of the activity, you must attempt a Crafting check. The GM sets the DC of this check based on the level of the item you are attempting to deconstruct, its rarity, and other circumstances.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> If you are deconstructing the item to make a new, similar item, you can apply 80% of the cost of the deconstructed item to the new item. If you are deconstructing the item for raw materials alone, you can apply 55% of the cost of the deconstructed item to a single new item. In either case, if this is in excess of the new item's cost, the remainder is lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but you can only apply 75% of the deconstructed item's cost to the new similar item and 50% of the deconstructed item's cost to any single item.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to deconstruct the item, wasting your time. You can try again.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You fail to deconstruct the item and damage it in the process. You must either repair it before attempting again, or you can attempt to deconstruct it again but lose 5% of the value of the item.</p>"
