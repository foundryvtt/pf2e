(The hidden condition allows you to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Sneak]{Sneak} away, as described on page 252.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except Step or use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Hide]{Hide} or the Sneak action of the Stealth skill (pages 251 and 252). If you Strike a creature, the creature remains @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} against that attack, and you then become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Observed]{Observed}. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You don't divert the attention of any creatures whose Perception DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are aware you were trying to trick them.</p>"
