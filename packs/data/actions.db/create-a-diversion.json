This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except Step or use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Hide]{Hide} or the Sneak action of the Stealth skill. If you Strike a creature, the creature remains @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} against that attack, and you then become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Observed]{Observed}.
