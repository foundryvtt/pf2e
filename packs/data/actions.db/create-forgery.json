Only those who carefully examine the document and attempt a Perception or Society check against your Society DC can do so.</p>\n<p>If the document's handwriting doesn't need to be specific to a person, you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain up to a +4 circumstance bonus to your check, as well as to your DC (the GM determines the bonus). To forge a specific person's handwriting, you need a sample of that person's handwriting.</p>\n<p>If your check result was below 20, the forgery has some obvious signs of being a fake, so the GM compares your result to each passive observer's Perception DC or Society DC, whichever is higher, using the success or failure results below. Once the GM rolls your check for a document, that same result is used against all passive observers' DCs no matter how many creatures passively observe that document.</p>\n<p>An observer who was fooled on a passive glance can still choose to closely scrutinize the documents on the lookout for a forgery, using different techniques and analysis methods beyond the surface elements you successfully forged with your original check. In that case, the observer can attempt a Perception or Society check against your Society DC (if they succeed, they know your document is a forgery).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The observer does not detect the forgery.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The observer knows your document is a forgery.</p>"
