An ideal environment for the yellow musk creeper isn't inhabited, but draws occasional humanoid visitors the plant can transform into thralls. The yellow musk creeper enraptures creatures with its bright yellow pollen to bring them close. It then physically alters their brains with its tendrils, implanting a seed in each to turn the creatures into mindless thralls. The yellow musk creeper might try to take over a sleeping creature, but it lacks the faculties to sneak up on anyone, and is likely to wake victims before it can drag itself close enough.</p>\n<p>The plant's pollen can spread far on the wind but quickly becomes too diffuse to cause harm. Wilderness scouts learn to sniff out the distinctive musky scent of the pollen, which stays potent even in harmless quantities. A sprouting creeper is also easy to detect, since it grows from the rotting, messy corpse of a thrall creature.",
