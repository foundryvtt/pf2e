The yellow musk creeper enraptures creatures with its bright yellow pollen to bring them close. It then physically alters their brains with its tendrils, implanting a seed in each to turn the creatures into mindless thralls. The yellow musk creeper might try to take over a sleeping creature, but it lacks the faculties to sneak up on anyone, and is likely to wake victims before it can drag itself close enough.</p>\n<p>The plant's pollen can spread far on the wind but quickly becomes too diffuse to cause harm.
