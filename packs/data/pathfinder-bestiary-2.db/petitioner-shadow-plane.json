Once they have been judged, their soul is sent on to their final reward or punishment in the afterlife, and in the process is transformed into a creature known as a petitioner. This process grants the soul a new body, one whose shape is the result of the prevailing philosophical forces of the plane to which it is sent. The petitioner's memories from their life are typically wiped nearly clean, allowing them to retain only a few hazy fragments akin to half-remembered dreams. Regardless of the petitioner's size, power, or nature in life, they're a Medium creature in their afterlife.</p>\n<p>Existence as a petitioner can last for eons, but this state is not necessarily eternal. Deities, powerful denizens of the Great Beyond, or even the outer planes themselves can further change the petitioner's nature by transforming them into raw quintessence, spiritual essence that is then used to expand a plane's physical manifestation, or by transforming the petitioner into a new form of supernatural life such as a celestial, monitor, or fiend. Should a petitioner die, their body breaks down in a process akin to decay, their nature reverting back to the quintessence or elements that make up their plane. This represents the true end of a soul's journey: their associated life essence travels back to the heart of the Great Beyond to be recycled into the Positive Energy plane, fueling the creation of entirely new souls.</p>\n<p>The mutilated appear as they did in their mortal lives, yet are covered in wounds or partially adorned or wrapped in chains.</p>",
