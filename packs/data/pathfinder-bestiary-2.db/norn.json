Her powers remain strong, but her ability to interpret fate becomes skewed and warped. Lost norns begin to use their abilities for their own goals rather than serving fate. A lost norn&apos;s alignment slowly shifts from lawful neutral to either lawful evil or lawful good, depending on how she interprets her visions.<h3 class=\"title\"><img alt=\"Sidebar - Advice and Rules\" title=\"Sidebar - Advice and Rules\" style=\"height:20px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px\" src=\"Images\\Icons\\Sidebar_1_AdviceAndRules.png\"> Norn Triumvirates</h3>Norns who visit the Material Plane often do so in groups of three known as triumvirates. The norns of a triumvirate can communicate with each other telepathically over a planetary distance. Regardless of their appearance on the First World, when a norn becomes part of a triumvirate on the Material Plane, her apparent age shifts so that in each group, there always appears to be one young adult norn, one middleaged norn, and one elderly norn&#x2014;a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch.",

            "flavorText": "Ancient beyond imagining, norns are powerful fey women who hold in their hands the physical manifestation of fate and destiny in the form of golden thread. They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon—or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings.<br><br> Norns' relationship with the Eldest of the First World is complex. Many among norns serve Magdh the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the first norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies: a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod. These norns find the other Eldest even more alien and challenging to interact with, for they believe that while the Eldest wield great power, even these powerful beings should not be granted leave to meddle with fate as much as they desire.<br><br> While even the weakest of the Eldest could destroy an unaffiliated norn with ease, they tend to obey the proclamations and judgments of norns when they are spoken. These norns, for their part, use their perceived neutrality judiciously. They know better than to issue too many demands to the Eldest, lest the capricious demigods grow frustrated and tired of norns' interference. And so the balance of power remains tenuous between unaffiliated norns and the Eldest, as it has for eons. However, norns know that it's merely a matter of time before the Eldest lose their respect for this tradition and start acting entirely as they please, despite norns' best efforts to rein in their most disruptive actions.<br><br> A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.<br><br> Worshipping Norns On the Material Plane, some mortals worship norns as deities, while others, especially witches and bards, admire them as patrons or muses. Those who uphold norns as deities are known as Followers of Fate. Norns do little to discourage this veneration, but neither do they go out of their way to support such worship. Clerics who venerate norns might worship a specific norn or norn triumvirate, or all norns as a whole, but they gain the same benefits regardless of their choice. The religious symbol of Followers of Fate is a pair of shears cutting a golden thread, and their areas of concern are destiny, fate, and the aging process.<br><br>"

Immediately after casting time stop, you can use up to 9 actions in 3 sets of up to 3 actions each. After each set of actions, 1 round passes, but only for you, effects specifically targeting or affecting you, and effects you create during the stoppage. All other creatures and objects are invulnerable to your attacks, and you can't target or affect them with anything. Once you have finished your actions, time begins to flow again for the rest of the world. If you created an effect with a duration that extends beyond the time stop's duration, such as wall of fire, it immediately affects others again, but it doesn't have any of the effects that happen only when you first cast the spell.</p>",

                    "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">You enforce a magic rule on a willing target, forcing it to either perform or refrain from carrying out a certain act. A <em>geas</em> to perform an act is usually conditional, such as, “Always offer hospitality to strangers seeking a place to stay.” An unconditional <em>geas</em> to perform a certain act doesn’t require the target to perform that act exclusively, though it must prioritize the task above all leisurely pursuits. The most common <em>geas</em> to refrain from carrying out an act is a specification to avoid violating a contract. In those cases, the secondary caster usually takes charge of making sure the wording of the contract is attuned correctly with the ritual’s magic. Because the target is willing, <em>geas</em> can have a duration that lasts for as long as the target agrees to. If the target is unable to fulfill the <em>geas</em>, it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} 1, and the sickened condition increases by 1 for each consecutive day it is prevented from following the <em>geas</em>, to a maximum of sickened 4. The sickened condition ends immediately when it follows the <em>geas</em> again; it can’t remove the sickened condition in any other way. Only powerful magic such as a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish} spell can remove the effects of <em>geas</em> from a willing target.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The <em>geas</em> succeeds, and the target receives a +1 status bonus to skill checks that directly uphold the <em>geas</em> (at the GM’s discretion)<br><strong>Success</strong> The <em>geas</em> succeeds.<br><strong>Failure</strong> The <em>geas</em> fails.<br><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The <em>geas</em> fails, and you are instead affected by the <em>geas</em> you were attempting to place on the target. You are considered an unwilling target, so the <em>geas</em> can be counteracted with a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.OyFCwQuw8XRazsNr]{Remove Curse} spell.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Heightened </strong> You can use <em>geas</em> on an unwilling creature; it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. If the target fails this Will save, the <em>geas</em> lasts up to 1 week. A <em>remove curse</em> spell can counteract a <em>geas</em> on an unwilling creature, in addition to powerful magic such as a <em>wish</em> spell. A clever unwilling creature can subvert the <em>geas</em> by contriving situations that prevent it from complying, but in that case it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} (as described above).<br><strong>Heightened </strong> As 5th level, but the <em>geas</em> lasts for up to 1&nbsp;year on an unwilling creature.<br><strong>Heightened </strong> As 5th level, but the geas lasts for a duration you choose (even unlimited) on an unwilling creature.</p>",
