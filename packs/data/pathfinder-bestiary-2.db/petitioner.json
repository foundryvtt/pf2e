            "flavorText": "When a mortal dies, their soul travels to the Boneyard in the Outer Planes where they are judged by Pharasma, the goddess of the dead. Once they have been judged, their soul is sent on to their final reward or punishment in the afterlife, and in the process is transformed into a creature known as a petitioner. This process grants the soul a new body, one whose shape is the result of the prevailing philosophical forces of the plane to which it is sent. The petitioner's memories from their life are typically wiped nearly clean, allowing them to retain only a few hazy fragments akin to half-remembered dreams. Regardless of the petitioner's size, power, or nature in life, they're a Medium creature in their afterlife.<br /><br /> Existence as a petitioner can last for eons, but this state is not necessarily eternal. Deities, powerful denizens of the Great Beyond, or even the outer planes themselves can further change the petitioner's nature by transforming them into raw quintessence, spiritual essence that is then used to expand a plane's physical manifestation, or by transforming the petitioner into a new form of supernatural life such as a celestial, monitor, or fiend. Should a petitioner die, their body breaks down in a process akin to decay, their nature reverting back to the quintessence or elements that make up their plane. This represents the true end of a soul's journey: their associated life essence travels back to the heart of the Great Beyond to be recycled into the Positive Energy plane, fueling the creation of entirely new souls.",

Rather, they immediately reincarnate into a fey creature whose temperament and role match their mortal personalities. This process tends to leave souls who incarnate into the First World with slightly more fragments of memories than most petitioners, yet still not enough that they remember who they once were.<h3 class=\"title\"><img alt=\"Sidebar - Advice and Rules\" title=\"Sidebar - Advice and Rules\" style=\"height:20px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px\" src=\"Images\\Icons\\Sidebar_1_AdviceAndRules.png\"> Other Petitioners</h3>Each plane  has its own category of petitioner, but not every plane or demiplane present in the Pathfinder setting is listed here. Certainly, planes of your own design aren&apos;t represented! You can use the wide range of petitioner types and descriptions here as templates or inspiration for creating new types of petitioners: each needs a name, appearance, alignment, language, additional ability, and attack. For instance, Desna maintains a demiplane called Cynosure that straddles the Material Plane and Elysium. Petitioners on Cynosure are known as the chosen dreamers, and they appear as idealized and softly glowing versions of their mortal selves; they are chaotic good, speak Celestial, are immune to @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Confused]{Confused} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied}, and deal bludgeoning damage with their fists.",
