Until you fulfill this fate, any time you would die, a grave but nonfatal misfortune instead befalls you.</p>\n<p>You take at least a full day to recuperate and you potentially face permanent consequences, but you don't die. If you would have died even once without this boon, once your fate is complete, you let out a final sigh and then die peacefully.</p>"
