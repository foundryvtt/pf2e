Once, you can summon a cloud of midges, mosquitos, and flies to surround you for 1 minute. Creatures adjacent to you at any point during that time become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Drained]{Drained 1}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened 1}, and exposed to a blood-borne illness. Ghlaunder typically grants this boon when you can infect a significant number of creatures.</p>"
