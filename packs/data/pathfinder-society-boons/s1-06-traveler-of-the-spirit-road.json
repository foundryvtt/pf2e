The kami's blessing follows you now and protects you from bad luck. Whenever you would critically fail a check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Hide], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sneak], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sense Direction], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Track] while in a forested area, you may check a box next to this boon as a free action to treat that check as a failure instead.</p>"
