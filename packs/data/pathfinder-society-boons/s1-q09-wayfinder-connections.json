You can purchase wayfinders of up to your character level + 2 as long as you have access to them. If you own a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder]{Standard Wayfinder}, Muesello offers to upgrade it to a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wayfinder] with additional features for the difference in cost between the items.</p>"
