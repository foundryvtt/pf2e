    "content": "<p>Not all cops are passionate about their jobs. For some, the pursuit of justice is just another way to pay the bills. Honestly, it was probably the Post Guard&rsquo;s generous time-off policy that drew you to their service, and during your yearly sabbaticals you&rsquo;ve dabbled in hobbies as diverse as fishing, baking, or even stand-up comedy. Even while on duty, you&rsquo;re probably idly fiddling with a lucky coin or practicing magic tricks with a deck of cards. You probably irritate your fellow guards a bit with your non sequiturs, casual attitude, and tendency to daydream, but results don&rsquo;t lie, and more often than not you prove your worth when the chips are down.</p>\n<p>For all the excitement of guarding Absalom&rsquo;s Postern Gate, the Post Guard wasn&rsquo;t really the right fit for someone as distractible as yourself, so your boss put in a &ldquo;promotion&rdquo; for you to transfer to the newly formed Edgewatch. You&rsquo;re all for the reassignment, since it will put you smack in the middle of the most entertaining and diverse gathering of the century, the Radiant Festival.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Dexterity</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Intelligence</span>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;re trained in the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Performance</span> skill, a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Lore skill</span> of your choice, and you gain a <em>bonus language</em>. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Deception</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Diplomacy</span>, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Intimidation</span> checks to interact with Post Guards.
