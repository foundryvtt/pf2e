In the south, farmers toil in dusty fields to eat the same vegetables every day, but your diet is varied and you're rarely hungry-the entire Realm is your garden.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Constitution</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Survival skill and the Herbalism Lore skill.
