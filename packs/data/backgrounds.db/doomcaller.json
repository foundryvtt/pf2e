Others might spurn your warnings, while some might join you in enlightening the ignorant. To you, there's no greater truth than the coming end, and you know that whatever the cause for it will come from the stars-or perhaps the stars are just a gate to a more terrifying beyond.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts.
