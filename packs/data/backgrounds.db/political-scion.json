    "content": "<p>Like your parents and your parents before them, you initially followed the long path toward politics from an early age. Your close association with Absalom&rsquo;s upper echelons put you in touch with the city&rsquo;s various military or special operations units&mdash;the First Guard, the Wave Riders, the Varlokkur&mdash;though you avoided any actual duty with these groups. Thanks to your strict upbringing and the connections of your family, you soon became a lauded and highly respected member of Absalom&rsquo;s political elite. But you couldn&rsquo;t stifle a certain feeling that you were destined for more than simply filling the pointed shoes of your forebears. Despite your easily earned accolades and a relatively cushy life as a young lawyer or councilmember, you sought to do more with your diplomatic training and not live out the exact same life as your ancestors.</p>\n<p>Your decision to transfer to the Edgewatch has rubbed your traditionalist family the wrong way, and they&rsquo;ve cut off the financial aid they&rsquo;ve provided you your whole life. But you don&rsquo;t care&mdash;you know you&rsquo;re doing the right thing by taking on the rough jobs of a low-ranking guard, and you&rsquo;re ready to shine based on your own merits, not those of your lofty kin.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Constitution</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Intelligence</span>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;re trained in the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Diplomacy</span> skill and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Legal Lore</span>. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Deception</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Diplomacy</span>, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Intimidation</span> checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interact} with members of Absalom&rsquo;s political establishment. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.4RjDxgvNXNl5GG9d]{Hobnobber} skill feat.</p>",
