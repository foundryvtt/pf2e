You might have inklings deep within your mind, undercurrents of unusual emotions or unexpected responses to certain people or situations, but ultimately you don&rsquo;t know who you once were. You might be adventuring specifically to help discover yourself. It&rsquo;s up to you and the GM how to handle the truth of your character&rsquo;s backstory. You could leave it to the GM so it&rsquo;s a secret, work together with the GM, or even choose to leave it undecided until later. In any case, you and your GM should determine a few noteworthy details about your character or their belongings to get the first clues to your past. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-77a8143a-7fff-ccd2-ed5f-53f1fac42b75\">You gain three free ability boosts. You choose two, and the GM chooses the third based on their first inklings of your character&rsquo;s possible history.</span></p>",
