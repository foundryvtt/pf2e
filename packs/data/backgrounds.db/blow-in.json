The Circus of Wayward Wonders came together with several different workers and performers a few months ago. Many came from a circus in Escadar called the Celestial Menagerie, but not all of them. It was easy to slip in among the roustabouts. Although you'd planned to move on quickly, the circus folk have adopted you as one of their own, and they don't ask questions about your past.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Charisma</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">You're trained in your choice of either the Deception or Thievery skill, as well as the Underworld Lore skill. You gain a skill feat: @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Lengthy Diversion]{Lengthy Diversion} if you chose Deception, or @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Subtle Theft]{Subtle Theft} if you chose Thievery.</span></p>",
