The Circus of Wayward Wonders came together with several different workers and performers a few months ago. Many came from a circus in Escadar called the Celestial Menagerie, but not all of them. It was easy to slip in among the roustabouts. Although you&rsquo;d planned to move on quickly, the circus folk have adopted you as one of their own, and they don&rsquo;t ask questions about your past.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Charisma</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">You're trained in your choice of either the Deception or Thievery skill, as well as the Underworld Lore skill. You gain a skill feat: @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.HEBXaS656MZTiWFu]{Lengthy Diversion} if you chose Deception, or @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.hVZbnsDuXihggylt]{Subtle Theft} if you chose Thievery.</span></p>",
