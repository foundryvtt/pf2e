Even if your understanding of advanced technology is imperfect, your hard-learned lessons are invaluable in deciphering and repairing gear.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Constitution</strong> or <strong>Intelligence</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Crafting skill and the Engineering Lore skill.
