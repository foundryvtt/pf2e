The Society might have recruited you for your esoteric abilities, or you might have sought out the Society's protection in escaping the covetously vile Technic League. Even if your understanding of advanced technology is imperfect, your hard-learned lessons are invaluable in deciphering and repairing gear.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Constitution</strong> or <strong>Intelligence</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Crafting skill and the Engineering Lore skill. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Quick Repair]{Quick Repair} skill feat.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 6 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>"
