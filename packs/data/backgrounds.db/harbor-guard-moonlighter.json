    "content": "<p>The Harbor Guard isn&rsquo;t known for being the most honorable precinct in town. A few years after you joined the force, you became disillusioned by the rampant corruption within the precinct and the district at large. One night, you stumbled on an ad for a local monster hunter&rsquo;s guild. You joined on a whim, but fell in love with the swashbuckling lifestyle of an independent bounty hunter. You&rsquo;ve since earned quite a reputation for your nocturnal adventures; everyone still knows that you&rsquo;re a Harbor Guard, but stories of your dungeon-delving adventures have long overshadowed that facet of your life. Unfortunately, long nights of monster‑hunting have negatively impacted your performance at your day job, so maybe it wasn&rsquo;t a surprise when your supervising officer put in a transfer request for you, spelling the end of your plucky nighttime antics with that particular guild.</p>\n<p>Despite the decline in your performance, Lieutenant Lavarsus of Edgewatch sees potential (and even, maybe, a bit of himself) in you. You&rsquo;re eager to be on a new unit and for the chance to bring your monster-hunting skills to a district that has been plagued by such supernatural beasts for far too long.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Strength</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Constitution</span>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;re trained in the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Athletics</span> skill and your choice of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sailing Lore</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Hunting Lore</span>. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Deception</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Diplomacy</span>, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Intimidation</span> checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interact} with Harbor Guards, ship captains, and freelance adventurers.
