Whether a crewmate on a ship, a conscript in an army, or something worse, you've nowhere to go but up. This background generally requires buy-in with the entire group to tell a story allowing you to play a character starting their adventuring due to circumstances outside their own control. However, you can also play a character who was once press-ganged and has since escaped that life. If you do, press-ganged doesn't have the uncommon trait, and it has the same mechanical effects either way.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Strength</strong> or <strong>Constitution</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Labor Lore skill. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Armor Assist]{Armor Assist} skill feat.</p>"
