You helped the Celebrants plan parades, exciting displays like circuses, news missives, and more to help push messages of loyalty to the nation. Even though most Celebrants are followers of Urgathoa, deity of gluttony and undeath, you might follow a different faith (or no faith at all); more important is helping Celebrants spread their message. You started to see that propaganda was often timed to help the Celebrants, in addition to the nation as a whole, and you saw just how powerful the right message at the right time can be.</p>\n<p>You are still well-regarded by the Celebrants. Your party gains 1 Reputation Point with the Celebrants at the start of the campaign.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Charisma</strong> or <strong>Dexterity</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in your choice of the Acrobatics or Performance skill. You gain a skill feat: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Steady Balance]{Steady Balance} if you chose Acrobatics or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Impressive Performance]{Impressive Performance} if you chose Performance. You're also trained in Urgathoa Lore.</p>"
