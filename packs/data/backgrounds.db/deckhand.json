Whether your crew retired, your ship sank, or you've turned to adventuring so you can keep all the treasure for yourself, you still retain an excellent sense of balance and quick reflexes.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Strength</strong> and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Acrobatics skill, and the Sailing Lore skill.
