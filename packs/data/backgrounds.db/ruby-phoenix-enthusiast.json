            "value": "<p>Named for the legendary sorcerer Hao Jin, the Ruby Phoenix Tournament occurs once every 10 years in Goka and attracts extraordinary talent from across the world. You might have begun training for the tournament but never participated, or perhaps you entered the tournament only to be defeated by (and inspired to join) the Pathfinder Society. Either way, your dedicated training prepares you for the rigors of the adventuring lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Strength</strong> or <strong>Dexterity</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Gladiatorial Lore skill. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Combat Climber]{Combat Climber} skill feat. In addition, you gain access to one of the following uncommon monk weapons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Kama]{Kama},</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Nunchaku]{Nunchaku},</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Sai]{Sai},</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Shuriken]{Shuriken}, or</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Temple Sword]{Temple Sword}.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 3 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>"
