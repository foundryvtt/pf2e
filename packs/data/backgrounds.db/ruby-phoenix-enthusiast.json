Either way, your dedicated training prepares you for the rigors of the adventuring lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Strength</strong> or <strong>Dexterity</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;re trained in the Athletics skill and the Gladiatorial Lore skill.
