You... are not one of them. But you know enough about the occult, as well as cold reading tricks and various practices from local religions, to scam your way into people's coinpurses. Unlike a through-and-through charlatan, there's some real occult methodology behind your flimflam, but that's likely cold comfort to the people you swindle. Whether you decided to take a more righteous path, were caught and pledged to make it right, or still slip in a few \"s√©ances\" between adventures, you've taken to an adventuring lifestyle as you move from place to place.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Intelligence</strong> or <strong>Charisma</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in Occultism and Fortune-Telling Lore.</p>\n<p>You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Deceptive Worship]{Deceptive Worship} skill feat.</p>"
