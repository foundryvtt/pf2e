You returned home with more caution and knowledge of the world beyond Breachill's borders, but still determined to win fame.</p>\n<p>You've decided that joining an adventuring group would be the best way to secure aid in your quest to build your own reputation, and are attending the Call for Heroes to find such allies.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Intelligence</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Survival skill and the Darklands, Desert, or Jungle Lore skill.
