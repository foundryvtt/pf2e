You had the poor fortune to be born into slavery, but the good luck to have grown up in the city of Kintargo. When Ravounel seceded from Cheliax, the leaders of this new nation freed all slaves, and you've wasted no time in exploring and establishing your new life. How and why you've come to Breachill is left to you to decide-but the fact that you feel empowered to determine your own destiny continues to drive you!</p>\n<p>The chance to become an adventurer has excited you for some time, as you hope to build a new life for yourself as a hero rewarded with fame and fortune. Joining the Call for Heroes is a great opportunity to find a group to adventure with.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Charisma</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Stealth skill and the Kintargo Lore skill. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Terrain Stalker]{Terrain Stalker} skill feat.</p>"
