    "content": "<p>You&rsquo;ve served on the Muckruckers, the unofficial guards of the flooded Puddles district. The pay&rsquo;s no good, the conditions are squalid, and you&rsquo;ve seen things during your time on the force that&rsquo;ve made you question your career entirely. Perhaps you joined the group out of a sense of duty to your fellow Absalomians, or maybe you felt an obligation to help restore your apocalyptic home district to some semblance of normalcy. Either way, the traumas you&rsquo;ve endured, the double-crossers who&rsquo;ve betrayed you, the wretched monsters that have crawled out of the muck to assail you&mdash;it&rsquo;s enough to turn an officer to weary cynicism or self-destruction through merciful drink.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, you found an out: an invitation to transfer to the newly formed Edgewatch. You accepted the offer in the hope that some fresh experience in a new district, surrounded by new people, might reignite the hope and passion you felt for the job so long ago.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Constitution</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Charisma</span>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;re trained in the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Survival</span> skill, as well as either <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Labor Lore</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Underworld Lore</span>.
