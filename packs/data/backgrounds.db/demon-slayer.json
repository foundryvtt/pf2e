You might be a hardened recruit who clashed with the demons, or perhaps you were a survivor who lost everything to the fiendish armies and narrowly escaped-or was rescued by Pathfinders. Your exposure to the Worldwound has taught you vital lessons in identifying fiends and their magic.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Strength</strong> or <strong>Constitution</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Religion skill and the Demon Lore skill. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Recognize Spell]{Recognize Spell} skill feat. Add <strong>Abyssal</strong> to the list of additional languages you can learn for having a high Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 5 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>"
