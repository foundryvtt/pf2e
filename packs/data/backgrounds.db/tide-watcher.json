You've studied the moon's phases to predict the rise and fall of the ocean waters. Eventually, you gained a supernatural ability to foretell to some degree of accuracy the coming of more severe changes, such as tidal waves or encroaching storms. At times, it fell on you to warn settlements of such oncoming natural disasters.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in Nature and Ocean Lore. During the night when you can see the moon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to discern weather patterns and predict upcoming weather conditions-this bonus increases to +2 if you're in the vicinity of the ocean.</p>"
