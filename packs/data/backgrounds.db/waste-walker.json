You learned to adapt to the worst possible conditions and how to forage and survive in a place few others would dare to live.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to <strong>Strength</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Survival skill, and Mana Wastes Lore (or another similar Lore skill associated with the wastes where you grew up).
