These skills serve you well in your new life as an adventurer, as compared to the weight of a cannon, a gear load that makes your allies blanche just makes you laugh instead.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Strength</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Warfare Lore skill.
