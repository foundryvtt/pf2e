One must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Charisma</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in your choice of the Deception or Society skills, and gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Assurance]{Assurance} skill feat with your chosen skill. You're also trained in a Lore skill about a narrow category of creatures.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you receive a mission briefing at Greensteeples Manor (or a briefing from Benedet or Varian Jeggare at another location), you receive a warm welcome. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your checks to Gather Information or Recall Knowledge during the Getting Started segment of such adventures. Be sure to remind your GM that you have a relevant background.</p>"
