            "value": "<p>For some, the nuts and bolts of keeping the peace are practically second nature. Such is the case for you, a member of the Learned Guard with an incredible mind for investigation as well as a gift for understanding magic. You probably aren't a hit with your peers, who find your intellect and natural gift of deduction perhaps a bit off-putting, but when left to your own devices you excel, and you get along well with professors and mages such as those who work in Forae Logos or the Arcanamirium.</p>\n<p>After no shortage of debating the pros and cons, you decided to transfer to the Edgewatch precinct. Sure, you have a keen understanding of the theories and principles behind law enforcement, but you've reasoned that in order to be a truly effective guard you'll need some first-hand experience in a high-risk area nabbing suspects and protecting innocents-all the while taking fastidious notes and writing your grand thesis on the merits and shortcomings of Absalom's laws.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Intelligence</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Arcana skill, as well as Legal Lore. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Interact]{Interact} with Learned Guards and with academics such as librarians and scholars. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Recognize Spell]{Recognize Spell} skill feat.</p>"
