You have taken up the life of an adventurer-perhaps you're a deposed queen hoping to regain her throne, a prince seeking a more exciting life, or a princess on a secret mission. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ddbf9a70-7fff-fc3b-0fb7-dadc149f3c03\">Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Intelligence</strong> or <strong>Charisma</strong>, and one is a free ability boost. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ddbf9a70-7fff-fc3b-0fb7-dadc149f3c03\">You are trained in Society. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Courtly Graces]{Courtly Graces} skill feat and can influence commoners in your family's territory, as well as nobility anywhere.
