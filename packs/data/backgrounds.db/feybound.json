You must follow some rule or limitation as part of your pact with the fey. If you violate the rule, you lose Fey's Fortune until you receive the effects of a successful @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Atone]{Atone} ritual using the Nature skill. The exact limitation is up to you and the GM, but the most common requirement is that you must fulfill a single request from any fey who knows your name.</p>"
