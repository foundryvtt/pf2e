From books to classes, you're committed to imparting knowledge to all. Not everything can be taught or learned from a book, though, so you've become an adventurer to learn subjects more directly and bring that wisdom back to your students. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-71cd2c79-7fff-dfe4-1c3c-e595ec660da5\">Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Intelligence</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and one is a free ability boost. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-71cd2c79-7fff-dfe4-1c3c-e595ec660da5\">You're trained in your choice of the Performance or Society skills, along with the Academia Lore skill.
