Yet you have no substantive proof of your nobility, and you've learned that claiming such without evidence is a fool's game. Whether a recent attempt to prove your heritage brought down the wrath of a noble family or you seek to prove the worth of the blood in your veins, you've joined an expedition into the Stolen Lands, hoping to make a name all your own.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Charisma</strong> or <strong>Constitution</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Politics Lore skill. You take a -1 penalty on all Charisma-based skill checks attempted when dealing with members of the nobility, but gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Haughty Obstinacy]{Haughty Obstinacy} human ancestry feat, even if you aren't a human. If you manage to establish yourself as a true noble or secure a leadership role in a kingdom, you no longer take the penalty to Charisma-based checks.</p>"
