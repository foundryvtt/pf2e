No matter your reasons, you know how to be efficient and ruthless when the circumstances demand.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Intelligence</strong> or <strong>Charisma</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Intimidation skill and the Aspis Consortium Lore skill.
