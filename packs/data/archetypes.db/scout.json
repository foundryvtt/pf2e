Choose one enemy. Stride, Feint against that opponent, and then make a Strike against that foe. For your Feint, you can attempt a Stealth check instead of the Deception check that&rsquo;s usually required, because you use the terrain around you to catch your foe off-guard.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.KOf6kmwAZaUJSDW9]{Terrain Scout} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites&nbsp;</strong>Scout Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You gain the Terrain Stalker skill feat (Core Rulebook 267) twice, choosing a different terrain each time.
