But some embrace the shadow, gain power from it, and dance within its shifting dark.</p>\n<p>A true shadowdancer is a creature who flits on the edge of light and darkness. Moving amid the inky blackness, shadowdancers are spies, assassins, infiltrators, and emissaries. Some shadowdancers use their relationship with the dark for good, while others embrace the primordial night, its terror, and its betrayal.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the reason why someone embraces the shadows, the shadows embrace that person in turn, gradually transforming them into something inky, nebulous, and mysterious.</p>\n<p>Additional Feats: 10th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Uncanny Dodge]{Uncanny Dodge}; 14th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Spring from the Shadows]{Spring from the Shadows}; 16th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Sense The Unseen]{Sense The Unseen}; 18th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Cognitive Loophole]{Cognitive Loophole}</p>\n<p><strong>CALL OF SHADOWS</strong></p>\n<p>The shadows call out to a potential shadowdancer in a myriad of ways. Often it starts with fear-fear of the dark, fear of enemies, or an underlying uncontrolled anxiety and the desire to gain power over the darkness. Many potential shadowdancers hear the shadows whisper in their heads. First dismissed as some perverse trick of the mind, the whispers can seem to ebb and wane, but a true calling becomes more lucid and more compelling.</p>\n<p>In some shadow-infused lands in the Pathfinder setting, particularly Nidal, Ustalav, and even Cheliax, organizations search for and recruit those called by the shadows, eager to transform them into spies and assassins. But the call can come to any creature anywhere. It's just a question of whether the creature heeds the call and forms a pact with the shadows.</p>\n<p>Though it is hard to convince many folks otherwise, given the fearsome reputations of shadowdancers working for dark powers and cabals, there is nothing intrinsically evil about embracing the shadows. Darkness is amoral but not without its champions for good and even law, though it is true that such shadowdancers are few and far between.</p>\n<p><strong>SHADOWDANCER FOCUS SPELLS</strong></p>\n<p>5th <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Dance of Darkness]{Dance of Darkness}</em>; <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Shadow Jump]{Shadow Jump}</em>; 6th <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Shadow Illusion]{Shadow Illusion}</em></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Shadowdancer Dedication]{Shadowdancer Dedication} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in Stealth, expert in Performance</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You dedicate yourself to the shadows.
