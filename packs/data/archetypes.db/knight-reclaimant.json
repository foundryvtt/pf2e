Accomplishing these goals requires the adoption of subtle tactics, with a focus on stealth and survival.</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Knights of Lastwall Archetypes</h2>\n<p><span>The following archetypes are uncommon but are available to members of the Knights of Lastwall. Qualifying characters with the Lastwall sentry archetype can select one of these dedications even without gaining three feats from the Lastwall sentry archetype, and each of these archetypes' feats fulfills the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Lastwall Sentry Dedication]{Lastwall Sentry Dedication}'s special requirement despite not being from the Lastwall sentry archetype.</span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Knight Reclaimant Dedication]{Knight Reclaimant Dedication} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Survival and Stealth, any non-evil alignment, member of the Knights of Lastwall of knight rank</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have sworn the Crimson Oath and become a full member of the Crimson Reclaimers. You gain expert proficiency in Stealth and Survival. Whenever you roll a success on a saving throw against an undead's special ability, you get a critical success instead. This applies to any abilities that come from being undead, including an undead's innate spells (but not its prepared or spontaneous spells).</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Knight Reclaimant archetype.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Invoke the Crimson Oath]{Invoke the Crimson Oath} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Knight Reclaimant Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can invoke the Crimson Oath to unleash blasts of ruby energy from your weapon. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Invoke the Crimson Oath]{Invoke the Crimson Oath} focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the Refocus activity to recite the Crimson Oath and meditate on its teachings; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your knight reclaimant focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Survivor of Desolation]{Survivor of Desolation} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Knight Reclaimant Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against unnatural weather events or environmental hazards occurring in blighted or otherwise unnaturally marred regions. If you roll a success on a saving throw against such an effect, you get a critical success instead; if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. This does not apply to unnatural events created or directed by active effects, such as spells that create anomalous weather or hazardous areas.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Blade of the Crimson Oath]{Blade of the Crimson Oath} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Knight Reclaimant Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You call upon the Crimson Oath to smite undead and then make a weapon or unarmed Strike against an undead foe. The Strike deals two extra weapon damage dice, and you can convert all the physical damage from the attack into positive damage.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Reaper of Repose]{Reaper of Repose} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Knight Reclaimant Dedication, master proficiency in a weapon</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your skill and fervor allow you to pierce undead defenses and exploit their weaknesses. When you make an attack using a weapon with which you have master proficiency and hit an undead creature, you ignore 5 points of the creature's resistances, and the undead's weaknesses are 2 higher against your attack.</p>",
