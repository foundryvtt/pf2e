You specialize in secrets, both uncovering them and hiding them away, and your command of the written word borders on the supernatural. As you discover deeper secrets of lore, you might develop a power over knowledge that becomes outright magical, allowing you to understand and disguise information even more effectively.</p>\n<p>Additional Feats: 4th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Loremaster's Etude]{Loremaster's Etude}; 8th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Assured Knowledge]{Assured Knowledge}; 14th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Enigma's Knowledge]{Enigma's Knowledge}; 16th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.True Hypercognition]{True Hypercognition}</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Loremaster Dedication]{Loremaster Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in at least one skill to Decipher Writing</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've compiled a vast repository of information that touches on nearly every subject.

You can take feats in the loremaster's additional feats entry even if you don't meet the enigma muse prerequisite.</p>\n<p>If you have the Bardic Lore class feat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with Bardic Lore.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Loremaster archetype.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Magical Edification]{Magical Edification} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Loremaster Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned those tidbits of magic that are most conducive to furthering your acquisition and transmission of knowledge.
