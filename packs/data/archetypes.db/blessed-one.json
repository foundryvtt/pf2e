    "content": "<h1>Blessed One</h1>\n<p>Through luck or deed, heritage or heroics, you carry the blessing of a deity. This blessing manifests as the ability to heal wounds and remove harmful conditions, and exists independent of worship. You might offer thanks daily to the deity whose power you wield, or you might carry these blessings reluctantly, seeking to avoid responsibility or even acting to defy the deity's influence on you. You might wear the robes of the deity's order, or you might give little thought and even less reverence to the source of your powers. However you feel about these gifts, there can be no doubt that you wield a special power. Good-aligned deities are most likely to empower a blessed one. However, deities of any alignment can grant such a blessing, as long as they are capable of granting a positive divine font to their clerics. This means such deities as Lamashtu might grant a foul version of the blessed one's powers.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats</strong> 6th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Accelerating Touch]{Accelerating Touch}, @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Mercy]{Mercy}; 8th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Invigorating Mercy]{Invigorating Mercy}; 10th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Greater Mercy]{Greater Mercy}; 12th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Elucidating Mercy]{Elucidating Mercy}, @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Resilient Touch]{Resilient Touch}; 14th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Affliction Mercy]{Affliction Mercy}, @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Amplifying Touch]{Amplifying Touch}; 20th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Rejuvenating Touch]{Rejuvenating Touch}</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Blessed One Dedication]{Blessed One Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p>You are touched by a deity and gifted with the ability to alleviate the suffering of others. You gain the lay on hands devotion spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the Refocus activity. You can Refocus by meditating, whether you reflect on the deity granting the blessing or not, allowing your blessing to refill your focus pool.

The condition must be one that could be removed by your Mercy feat, including those granted by later feats such as Greater Mercy. Attempt a counteract check based on the spell's DC and level.
