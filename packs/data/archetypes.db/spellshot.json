They come from a tradition of ancient secrets and principles, which they temper with modern innovation and perspective. Spellshots combine magical power into the art of gunplay to create a distinct and mystical way known only to spellshots, enigmatic and unavailable to other gunslingers in the world at large. The first to identify themselves as spellshots tied their magical traditions to the history of the Star Code and the Crowned Regents in Arcadia. Ancient, reclusive crafters known as the Crowned Regents created star guns, the legendary magical firearms that shot white-hot blasts of energy. Wielders of star guns became bound together by the Star Codeâ€”a set of cultural expectations that defined how one should behave while using these powerful weapons. You can find more information about star guns, the Crowned Regents, and the Star Code in Guns &amp; Gears.</p>\n<p>Most spellshots continue to come from Arcadia, as the stories describing the relevant skills and training to become one have been passed down over the generations. Many gunslingers who grow up in this region hear of these tales early in their lives, and they develop the techniques to channel magical energy through their firearms in imitation of the Regents' arcane methods. While Arcadia is home to the vast majority of the world's spellshots, the techniques have slowly spread to other regions. However, spellshots remain particularly rare in the Inner Sea region due to the unique history of guns there and their connection to the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, which exists in a magic-dead region of the Mana Wastes.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Spellshot Dedication]{Spellshot Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Way of the Spellshot]{Way of the Spellshot}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've steeped yourself in magic and gunplay to the extent that you can conjure bullets from thin air, using a rudimentary knowledge of arcane theory to create a temporary piece of ammunition. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Conjure Bullet]{Conjure Bullet} action.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat other than Beast Gunner Dedication until you've gained two other feats from the spellshot or beast gunner archetypes.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Fulminating Shot]{Fulminating Shot} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Spellshot Dedication]{Spellshot Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You channel potent magic into your next shot, empowering it with a blast of crackling energy. Choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire. If you hit with your next attack roll using a firearm or crossbow before the end of your turn, you deal [[/r {1d6}[additional]]]{1d6 additional damage} of this type. At 12th level, this increases to [[/r {2d6}[additional]]]{2d6 additional damage}, and at 18th level, it increases to [[/r {3d6}[additional]]]{3d6 additional damage}.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Call Gun]{Call Gun} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Spellshot Dedication]{Spellshot Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You build a powerful magical connection with a chosen gun or crossbow, gaining the ability to conjure it directly to your hand from any distant location.

It has a +4 status bonus to hit creatures wearing any type of armor.
