If you successfully identify a mental effect targeting you and the spell would normally fail or have no effect, you can make it appear as if you were affected and attempt to play along with the spell; if the spell normally establishes a mental link, it functions normally but you can disregard any commands you receive through the link.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Flicker]{Flicker} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Lion Blade Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You use your movements and disguises to make yourself a flickering blur.
