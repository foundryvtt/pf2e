When you succeed with Battle Medicine or Treat Wounds, the target regains 5 additional HP at DC 20, 10 HP at DC 30, or 15 HP at DC 40. Once per day, you can use Battle Medicine on a creature that's temporarily immune. If you're a master in Medicine, you can do so once per hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Medic archetype.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Doctor's Visitation]{Doctor's Visitation} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Medic Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You move to provide immediate care to those who need it. Stride, then use one of the following: Battle Medicine or Treat Poison.

If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one. Attempt a counteract check against the condition, using your Medicine modifier as your counteract modifier and the condition's source to determine the DC. You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you have Legendary Medic; even if you do, the counteract DC increases by 10. Treating a Condition that is continually applied under certain circumstances (for instance, the enfeebled condition a good character gains from carrying an unholy weapon) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Reduce the condition value by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Reduce the condition value by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Increase the condition value by 1.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Holistic Care]{Holistic Care} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Diplomacy, Treat Condition</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You provide emotional and spiritual care. Add frightened, stupefied, and stunned to the list of conditions you can reduce with Treat Condition. If the stunned condition has a duration instead of a value, you can't use Treat Condition to reduce it.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Resuscitate]{Resuscitate} Feat 16</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Medic Dedication, legendary in Medicine</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are holding healer's tools or are wearing them and have a hand free. Also, the target's body is mostly intact.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can use Medicine to resuscitate the dead. Attempt a DC 40 Medicine check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of raise dead, except it still has the wounded condition it had before dying, increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day.</p>\n",
