You gain the Hunt Prey action. You can use Hunt Prey to designate only a creature that you've seen, heard about, or learned about through some other means, such as a bounty board or wanted poster. In addition to the other benefits of Hunt Prey, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to Gather Information regarding your prey.</p>\n<p>If you already have Hunt Prey, you become an expert in Survival and gain the circumstance bonus to Gather Information about your prey; you can still designate a creature you're tracking during exploration, in addition to the conditions above.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the bounty hunter archetype.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Tools Of The Trade]{Tools Of The Trade} Feat 4</h2>\n<p>You're well-versed in weapons that allow you to bring bounties in alive. You are trained with the following weapons: bola, sap, and whip. You gain access to bolas.

An individual creature assisting you loses this benefit if they're out of your presence for too long to benefit from your instructions.
