    "content": "<h1>Pathfinder Agent</h1>\n<p>You're a field agent of the globe-trotting Pathfinder Society, sworn to report, explore, and cooperate. You explore the world, gathering artifacts and antiquities, and record your adventures for posterity.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Pathfinder Agent Dedication]{Pathfinder Agent Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> member of the Pathfinder Society</p>\n<p><strong>Access</strong> You are from Absalom.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your Pathfinder training has broadened your horizons and made you more flexible at various skills, since you never know when you might need an obscure skill to complete your mission. You become trained in one skill of your choice, or expert in a skill of your choice in which you were trained. You also become trained in Pathfinder Lore, or an expert if you were already trained. When using a skill untrained, your proficiency bonus is equal to your level instead of 0. You gain access to wayfinders.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Pathfinder Agent archetype.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Careful Explorer]{Careful Explorer} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've explored enough dusty tombs and hidden vaults to gain a sixth sense about traps, and you sometimes notice them even when you're not trying to. Even if you aren't Searching in exploration mode, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to Search for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Dead Reckoning]{Dead Reckoning} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication, trained in Survival</p>\n<hr />\n <p>You've trained yourself to maintain a strong sense of direction at all times, even when you can't use a compass or see the sky above. You immediately intuit which direction is north (assuming the concept of north exists at your current location).</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Deft Cooperation]{Deft Cooperation} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you set things up to help your allies, you also gain some of the fruits of your labors. When you successfully Aid an attack roll or AC, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls or AC against that enemy until the end of your next turn, whichever you granted to your ally. When you successfully Aid a skill check, if you attempt the exact same skill check (not just using the same skill, but using it for the same purpose, for instance a check to Climb the same wall) on your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your skill check.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Environmental Explorer]{Environmental Explorer} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n <p>You've traversed enough untamed wilderness to gain an intuitive understanding of the dangers that exist in such places. Your extensive familiarity means you sometimes notice perils even when you're not trying to. Even if you aren't Searching in exploration mode, you can attempt a check to find environmental hazards that normally require you to Search for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to find a particular hazard.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Observant Explorer]{Observant Explorer} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n <p>Thanks to the time you've spent wandering through wild and untamed environments, you've gained an intuitive sense about creatures. You sometimes notice them before they attack, or spot them nearby even if they weren't planning on attacking. You can attempt a check to notice hidden creatures attempting to Avoid Notice nearby even if you aren't actively Searching for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to notice a particular creature.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Remember Your Training]{Remember Your Training} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p>During your training to become a Pathfinder Agent you were schooled on a wide variety of creatures you might encounter, and you can think back to that training to gain crucial insight in times of need. Attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about a creature you can see, adding your level as a proficiency bonus if you are untrained (rather than 0). If you roll a failure (but not a critical failure) on this check, you get a success instead.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Spiritual Explorer]{Spiritual Explorer} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You're familiar with the danger that lingering spirits can pose to an unwary adventurer, and you're particularly attuned to their presence. Even if you aren't Searching in exploration mode, you can attempt a check to find haunts that normally require you to Search for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to find a particular haunt.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Thorough Reports]{Thorough Reports} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your reports are thorough and informative, and putting your thoughts to paper helps you retain the information. Keep track of each type of creature you successfully identify with Recall Knowledge. When attempting Recall Knowledge checks against creatures on your list in later encounters, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and you learn an additional fact about such creatures on a success.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Watch and Learn]{Watch and Learn} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An ally you can see succeeds or critically succeeds at a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check, using a skill in which you are untrained.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Pathfinder agents serve as members of diverse teams with complementary skill sets. You are practiced at following the example of a more skilled ally to accomplish a wide variety of tasks. For the next minute you can add your level as a proficiency bonus to the observed skill check, even though you are untrained. This does not allow you to attempt trained actions using that skill unless you would otherwise be able to do so.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer]{Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can use the unusual resonance of your wayfinder to grant it additional effects. Choose one cantrip from the arcane, divine, occult, or primal list. You can activate your wayfinder to cast that cantrip at will. Additionally, you can Activate your wayfinder with a Single Action (envision) activation to transform it into a nondescript pin or brooch to hide your affiliation with the Pathfinder Society. This transformation lasts for 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Archaeologist's Warning]{Archaeologist's Warning} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You are about to roll a Perception, Society, or Thievery check for initiative.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You visually or audibly warn your companions of danger, granting them a +1 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls. Depending on whether you use gestures or call out, this free action gains either the visual or auditory trait.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Craft Facsimile]{Craft Facsimile} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Crafting, Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n <p>You're renowned for your ability to recover important items, whether they're from a long-abandoned temple or a thieves' den, and sometimes that requires creating a stand-in. You can spend 1 minute to assemble a facsimile of an object of no more than 1 Bulk that you can see from available materials. The facsimile has the same shape and Bulk as the replaced object and can pass as the object if not examined. A creature familiar with the original who examines the object automatically realizes that it is a fake. A creature not familiar with the original can still tell it was a hastily jury-rigged stand-in of some kind, but they might not know the object was supposed to be something else.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Discerning Strike]{Discerning Strike} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication, Thorough Reports</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have successfully identified the target with Recall Knowledge during this combat.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Identifying a creature is the first step in finding its weaknesses. Attempt a Strike against the target; if successful, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage. If you have succeeded on a Recall Knowledge check against the target during this combat and their creature type was previously recorded using Thorough Reports, you also deal [[/r {1}[persistent,bleed]]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Persistent Damage]{Persistent Bleed Damage}. The creature is then temporarily immune to Discerning Strike for 1 day.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Forced Entry]{Forced Entry} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Athletics, Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You are trained to preserve the archaeological value of your location when entering. You don't take a penalty to Force Open doors, windows, or containers without a crowbar. If you roll a success on a check to Force Open, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Westyr's Wayfinder Repository]{Westyr's Wayfinder Repository} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication, Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have at least one 1st-level spell slot and a wayfinder.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can use your wayfinder to store a little extra magic for when you need it most. When making your daily preparations, you can choose one 1st-level spell from your spellbook or spell repertoire and store it in your wayfinder. You can cast this spell from the wayfinder using the normal actions required. Once the spell has been cast, it is expended, and you must make your next daily preparations to store another spell in your wayfinder.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Diverse Recognition]{Diverse Recognition} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication, master in a skill used to Recall Knowledge</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You successfully Recall Knowledge about a creature you can see, using a skill in which you are a master.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your Pathfinder training allows you to quickly size up numerous threats. Attempt to Recall Knowledge against a different kind of creature you can see using the same skill. You must still meet the requirements to attempt this check.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Recognize Threat]{Recognize Threat} Feat 8</h2>\n<div><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in a Recall Knowledge skill, Pathfinder Agent Dedication\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have master proficiency in a skill to identify the triggering creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your first turn of an encounter begins, and you can see a creature.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p>You quickly assess the threat so you can relay the information to your team. Attempt a Recall Knowledge check against the triggering creature.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Snap Out Of It! (Pathfinder Agent)]{Snap Out Of It!} Feat 8</h2>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication, master in Medicine</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Pathfinders are trained to help each other be safe and successful, and you know how to jolt your allies back to their senses. Attempt a Medicine check on an adjacent ally who is fascinated, frightened, stunned, or stupefied and choose one of those conditions. The DC is the DC for the effect that caused the condition.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 2. If you chose fascinated, that condition ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose fascinated, that condition ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You increase the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose fascinated, increase the duration by 1 round instead.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Wayfinder Resonance Infiltrator]{Wayfinder Resonance Infiltrator} Feat 8</h2>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication, Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You are adept at using the unusual resonance of your wayfinder to aid in any deceptions you might employ. Once per day you can activate your wayfinder to cast illusory disguise, heightened to 2nd level, as an arcane spell. Additionally, once per day, you can Activate your wayfinder with a single-action envision activation to transform it into a perfect replica of another similarly sized badge of membership or office, such as an Aspis Consortium badge. This transformation lasts for 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Eidetic Memorization]{Eidetic Memorization} Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Pathfinders are often asked to study the intricacies of ancient history under less than ideal conditions, and you've trained your brain to make the most of your limited time. You quickly memorize an inscription, scroll, or other piece of writing you can clearly see whose length is equivalent to no more than one page. You can then accurately recreate this writing using a writing kit, wax tablet, or other writing medium, once you have reached safety. You don't need to understand the writing or identify the language to reproduce it. Your memory lasts until the next time you make your daily preparations; if you have not written down or otherwise recreated what you saw by this point, your memory fades and any attempt to recreate what you saw is garbled and unintelligible. You can have only one piece of writing memorized at a time; any previous memorization fades the next time you use this ability.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Everyone Duck!]{Everyone Duck!} Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You fail, but don't critically fail, an attempt to Disable a Device on a trap.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You intentionally set off the trap, but you take special precautions to protect yourself and your allies from the trap's effects. For the next 2 rounds, if the trap rolls a critical success on an attack roll, it gets a normal success instead, and if anyone rolls a critical failure on their saving throw against the trap, they get a normal failure instead.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Educated Assessment]{Educated Assessment} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You attempt to Recall Knowledge about a creature, and the GM uses the same secret roll result against the creature's Deception or Stealth DC, giving you the information from a Battle Assessment. You might get a different degree of success on the Recall Knowledge check than what you get for the Battle Assessment. If you have the Battle Assessment feat, you gain the effects of Educated Assessment whenever you Recall Knowledge (such as with the Automatic Knowledge feat).</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Swap Investment]{Swap Investment} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your time as a Pathfinder has taught you how to improvise, and you've learned to make use of the resources you find in the field. You Invest a magic item and remove a previously invested item. The previous item no longer counts against your limit of 10 invested items.</p>",
