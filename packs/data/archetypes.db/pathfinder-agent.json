You become trained in one skill of your choice, or expert in a skill of your choice in which you were trained. You also become trained in Pathfinder Lore, or an expert if you were already trained. When using a skill untrained, your proficiency bonus is equal to your level instead of 0. You gain access to wayfinders.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Pathfinder Agent archetype.</p>\n<h2><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf2e.feats-srd\" data-id=\"qQh8wnslOagixxD1\"> Careful Explorer</a> Feat 4</h2>\n<p><span><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication<br /></span></p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've explored enough dusty tombs and hidden vaults to gain a sixth sense about traps, and you sometimes notice them even when you're not trying to.

When you successfully Aid an attack roll or AC, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls or AC against that enemy until the end of your next turn, whichever you granted to your ally. When you successfully Aid a skill check, if you attempt the exact same skill check (not just using the same skill, but using it for the same purpose, for instance a check to Climb the same wall) on your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your skill check.</p>\n<h2><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf2e.feats-srd\" data-id=\"vbHF6HEC9jQorFGl\"> Environmental Explorer</a> Feat 4</h2>\n<p><span><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication<br /></span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"color: #191813; font-family: Roboto, system, -apple-system, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">You've traversed enough untamed wilderness to gain an intuitive understanding of the dangers that exist in such places.

You sometimes notice them before they attack, or spot them nearby even if they weren't planning on attacking. You can attempt a check to notice hidden creatures attempting to Avoid Notice nearby even if you aren't actively Searching for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to notice a particular creature.</span></p>\n<h2><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf2e.feats-srd\" data-id=\"YhclkX1nfyUU8RtO\"> Remember Your Training</a> Feat 4</h2>\n<p><span><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #191813; font-family: Roboto, system, -apple-system, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Frequency </span></strong><span style=\"color: #191813; font-family: Roboto, system, -apple-system, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">once per day</span></p>\n<hr style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-family: Roboto, system, -apple-system, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-family: Roboto, system, -apple-system, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">During your training to become a Pathfinder Agent you were schooled on a wide variety of creatures you might encounter, and you can think back to that training to gain crucial insight in times of need.

If you roll a failure (but not a critical failure) on this check, you get a success instead.</p>\n<h2><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf2e.feats-srd\" data-id=\"pfBVx5xBfwKd1iVL\"> Spiritual Explorer</a> Feat 4</h2>\n<p><span><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication</span></p>\n<hr style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-family: Roboto, system, -apple-system, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-family: Roboto, system, -apple-system, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">You're familiar with the danger that lingering spirits can pose to an unwary adventurer, and you're particularly attuned to their presence.

The facsimile has the same shape and Bulk as the replaced object and can pass as the object if not examined. A creature familiar with the original who examines the object automatically realizes that it is a fake. A creature not familiar with the original can still tell it was a hastily jury-rigged stand-in of some kind, but they might not know the object was supposed to be something else.</span></p>\n<h2><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf2e.feats-srd\" data-id=\"OjvE7gaQgWiBqOhY\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Discerning Strike</a> Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Pathfinder Agent Dedication, Thorough Reports</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have successfully identified the target with Recall Knowledge during this combat.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Identifying a creature is the first step in finding its weaknesses.
