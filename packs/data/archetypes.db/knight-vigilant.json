Accomplishing these goals requires the adoption of subtle tactics, with a focus on stealth and survival.</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Knights of Lastwall Archetypes</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The following archetypes are uncommon but are available to members of the Knights of Lastwall. Qualifying characters with the Lastwall sentry&nbsp;archetype can select one of these dedications even without gaining three feats from the Lastwall sentry archetype, and each of these archetypes&rsquo; feats fulfills the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.bWYnjNa2RknMoibg]{Lastwall Sentry Dedication}'s special requirement despite not being from the Lastwall sentry archetype.</span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.1YFrl8I6ZGo7BIM9]{Knight Vigilant} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Religion, any good alignment, member of the Knights of Lastwall of knight rank</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You are dedicated to the cause of the Shining Sentinels.
