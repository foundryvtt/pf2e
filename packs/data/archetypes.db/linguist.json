You become trained in Society; if you were already trained in Society, you instead become an expert in Society. You gain the Multilingual skill feat twice.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Linguist archetype.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Multilingual Cipher]{Multilingual Cipher} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Linguist Dedication, expert in Society</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You use multiple languages to create and break codes. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Decipher Writing. If another creature attempts to Decipher Writing you encoded, they take a -2 circumstance penalty unless they speak all the languages you used when you created the writing.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Phonetic Training]{Phonetic Training} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Linguist Dedication, expert in Society</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can pronounce and repeat words with near-perfect accuracy even if you don't understand their meaning, and you can write them down in a phonetic script that allows you or another creature with Phonetic Training to read it later. Even if the words are in a language with sound you can't pronounce, you can faithfully transcribe them. Memorizing long sequences of words remains just as difficult as it is normally.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Spot Translate]{Spot Translate} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Linguist Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Another creature within 60 feet uses a linguistic effect in a language you understand.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You interpret a creature's words, repeating their message in a different language that you know. If the triggering effect's targets speak either the original language or the one you translated into, they are affected.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Analyze Idiolect]{Analyze Idiolect} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Linguist Dedication, expert in Deception and Society</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You break down a specific individual's idiolect, memorizing their speech mannerisms and habits. If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, when you later attempt to Impersonate that individual, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Deception checks and DCs. Due to the intense character study required, you can't remember more than one idiolect at a time.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Read Shibboleths]{Read Shibboleths} Feat 7</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Linguist Dedication, master in Society</p>\n<hr />\n<p>All communication is filled with slight tells and signals. If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, their regional words, pronunciation changes, and nonverbal cues provide you with a minor fact about their social environment, such as their hometown or certain groups they might belong to. If a target of this ability is being deceptive about their social environment, such as a commoner pretending to be a noble, they must attempt a Deception, Society, or appropriate Lore check against your Society DC, providing you a false minor fact consistent with their assumed identity on a success.</p>\n<p>Once you've gleaned one or more true minor facts about a person, you can then incorporate these mannerisms into your speech to present yourself in a way that they find familiar. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to your Diplomacy and Deception checks with them.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Crude Communication]{Crude Communication} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Linguist Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Even if you don't speak a creature's language, you can rely on inflection, root words, and body language to infer rudimentary meaning. If you interact with a creature for at least 10 minutes and that creature can speak a language, the GM rolls a secret Society check with a DC appropriate for the language's rarity. On a success, you understand the gist of the meaning and can communicate basic concepts back to the creature; on a failure, you are mistaken or communicate incorrect concepts. If you're legendary in Society, you can communicate instantly without needing to attempt a Society check; even if you didn't know the medium of communication the creature uses (speech, sign language, and so on), you intuit this information as soon as they try to communicate.</p>",
