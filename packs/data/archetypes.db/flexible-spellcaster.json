A healing font grants you additional spell slots to cast <em>heal</em> spells of the highest level you can cast, but doesn't add <em>heal</em> to your spell collection. A harming font does the same for the <em>harm</em> spell. As a specialist wizard, you prepare one spell per level from your specialty school, which also aren't added to your spell collection.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Flexible Spellcaster Dedication]{Flexible Spellcaster Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Flexible Spell Preparation]{Flexible Spell Preparation}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You now have four cantrips per day instead of three.
