Increase your maximum Hit Points by an amount equal to your level. You gain resistance to physical damage (except adamantine) equal to your number of class feats from the golem grafter archetype.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the golem grafter archetype.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Accursed Clay Fist]{Accursed Clay Fist} Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Golem Grafter Dedication, expert in unarmed attacks</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have replaced one of your forearms with one made of clay and infused with cursed arcane magic. When you make an unarmed Strike with your clay fist and hit, your target takes a -2 status penalty to saving throws against curse effects for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> The damage die for your clay fist is 1d8, and it loses the agile and finesse traits of a typical fist.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Quicken Heartbeat]{Quicken Heartbeat} Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per turn</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Golem Grafter Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've replaced your heart with one made of animated quicksilver and living adamantine.
