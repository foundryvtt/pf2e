Marshals can come from any class or background, though they all share a willingness to sacrifice their own glory for the greater good of the team. Some marshals lead from the front, sword and shield raised, while others may call instructions and encouragements from the rear while providing allied spellcasters with skilled support. Regardless of their preferred method of combat, marshals' ability to bring the best out in every ally is a valuable addition to any group.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats</strong> 8th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Attack of Opportunity]{Attack of Opportunity}</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Marshal Dedication]{Marshal Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in martial weapons and either Diplomacy or Intimidation</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've combined your social skills and combat training to become a talented combat leader.
