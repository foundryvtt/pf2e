Until they identify the cause of the tripped alarm, the guards block the exits and don't let anyone enter or exit the casino. Until the agents overcome this complication-such as by bluffing that a mouse or magical anomaly tripped the alarm or by knocking out Mazar and impersonating him-they accrue 2 AP (instead of 1 AP) each round of the infiltration. The characters need not address this complication immediately (that is, they can continue overcoming obstacles while this complication is active), but it behooves the players to take care of it sooner rather than later.</p>",
