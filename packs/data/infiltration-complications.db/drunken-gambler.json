This complication persists until it is overcome. The player can continue to conduct their heist without addressing this complication, but as long as the drunkard clings to the character, the DC of any Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check to overcome an obstacle is increased to 32. Thankfully, other patrons recognize the sorry situation of the character in question: if the player rolls one of the aforementioned checks and gets a critical failure, they accrue only 1 AP instead of the usual 2.</p>",
