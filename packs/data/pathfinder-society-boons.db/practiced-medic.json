While you have this boon slotted, you can spend Downtime to provide medical services to others. Once you have expended 8 days of Downtime in this way, this boon becomes slotless, and you can expend the boon as a free action before attempting a Medicine check to Administer First Aid, Treat Disease, Treat Poison, or Treat Wounds. You improve your check's degree of success by one step (such as if you roll a failure, you get a success instead); the boon is not expended if your original roll is a critical success. Once you expend this boon, it provides no other benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can purchase this boon multiple times, though you cannot expend more than one copy of this boon per adventure.</p>"
