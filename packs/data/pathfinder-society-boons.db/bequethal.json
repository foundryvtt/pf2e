When you acquire this boon, select one uncommon, rare, or unique character option to which you've gained access through an adventure's Chronicle sheet (e.g., a boon that allows you to acquire a special animal companion or purchase a special magic item). Choose another of your characters. That character gains access to that special option instead, though they may only use the option once their level equals or exceeds the lowest level able to play the Chronicle sheet's adventure (e.g., 5th level for Tier 5-8). On the Chronicle sheet, write \"Bequeathed\" and the recipient character's number next to the option. You no longer have access to that option (and must sell it back if you acquired the option and would no longer qualify for it).</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can purchase this boon multiple times. Each time you bequeath a different character option.</p>"
