This ally performs the selected skills with a total modifier equal to 2 + your level, and they are considered trained in the skills. You must expend any actions and be in range to perform the action yourself, and any consequences of these actions affect you (such as falling when using Athletics to Climb). The hireling's result cannot be modified by class abilities or spells, but it can be improved by a successful Aid check. The hireling does not participate directly in combat, cannot be harmed unless willfully endangered, and has no effect other than performing the selected skill checks.</p>\n<p>When you purchase this boon, you select one skill as well as one Lore skill. The hireling can perform only these skills checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can purchase this boon multiple times. Each time you purchase this boon, you can choose a different set of skills.</p>"
