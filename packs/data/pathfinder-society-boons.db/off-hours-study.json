When you acquire this boon, choose a common language you don't know or a Lore skill in which you are untrained. While you have this boon slotted, you can spend Downtime practicing the selected language or skill. Once you have expended 50 days of Downtime in this way, you learn the chosen language or become trained in the chosen Lore skill. This boon is then expended and grants no further benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can purchase this boon multiple times. Each time you do so, you select a different language or Lore skill.</p>"
