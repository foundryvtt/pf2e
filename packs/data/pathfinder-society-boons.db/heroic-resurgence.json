When you spend your Hero Points to avert death, note the value of your dying and wounded condition before applying the Hero Points’ effects. Until the end of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, and you also gain a circumstance bonus to your damage rolls, Perception checks, skill checks, and saving throws equal to the noted value (maximum +2 for Reputation tier 3, or +3 for Reputation tier 4).</p>",
