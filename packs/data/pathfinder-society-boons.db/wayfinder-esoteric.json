When you slot this boon, you apply its benefits to one @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Wayfinder]{Wayfinder} in your possession, granting you a special free action ability when the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Wayfinder]{Wayfinder} is invested and in your possession.</p>\n<p>You can activate this ability as a free action before you Recall Knowledge. If you roll a critical failure on the Recall Knowledge check, you instead get a failure.</p>\n<p>You can safely use this benefit once per adventure. You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Wayfinder]{Wayfinder} at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a DC 10 flat check. On a success, the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Wayfinder]{Wayfinder} is broken. On a failure, the <em>wayfinder</em> is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Wayfinder]{Wayfinder} that's already been overcharged, the item is automatically destroyed (even if it has been repaired) and does not provide the activated benefit.</p>"
