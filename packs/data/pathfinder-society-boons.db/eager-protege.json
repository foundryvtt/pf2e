This disciple observes your adventuring exploits and occasionally contributes directly; once per adventure before you attempt a skill check or attack roll, the ally successfully @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Aid]{Aids} you, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering check.</p>\n<p>Tally the amount of XP you earn while this boon is slotted. Once you have tallied 60 or more XP in this way, you can encourage your protégé to set off on their own on new adventures. When this happens, you can no longer slot this boon; however, you can expend the boon when creating a new character to begin the character at 2nd level with 12 XP, 12 Fame, 30 gp, and 12 Reputation to distribute among any number of legal factions. Once expended in this way, this boon provides no other benefits.</p>"
