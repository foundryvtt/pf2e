When you play or GM an adventure at a charity event registered with the Organized Play Foundation, you earn 2 additional Fame and Reputation with the Radiant Oath faction.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: You can benefit from this boon only a number of times equal to your current Reputation Tier with the Radiant Oath faction. Each time you fulfill the requirements of this boon, mark it on your Chronicle sheet along with the associated Reputation Tier. Have the GM sign beside this notation.</p>"
