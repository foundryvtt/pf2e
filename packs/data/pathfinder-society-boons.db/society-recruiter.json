If you bring a new player to a table-a player without a Pathfinder Society character or someone playing their first Pathfinder Society session-you earn 2 additional Fame and Reputation with the Envoys' Alliance faction.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can benefit from this boon only a number of times equal to your current Reputation Tier with the Envoys' Alliance faction. Each time you fulfill the requirements of this boon, mark it on your Chronicle sheet along with the associated Reputation Tier. Have the GM sign beside this notation. The player you introduce to Pathfinder Society does not have to play at the same table as you (though being at the same table often improves their experience).</p>"
