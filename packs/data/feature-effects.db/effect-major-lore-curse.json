This uses a skill of your choice that has the Recall Knowledge action, using a result equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus in that skill (with no other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).</p>\n<p>If you Cast a Spell with a verbal component, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the spell is lost.</p>\n<p>You gain a +4 status bonus on saving throws against linguistic effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Note: The bonus to saving throws and penalty to initiative rolls are applied automatically.
