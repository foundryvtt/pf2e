            "value": "<p>Life energy tears through you to empower your magic. Some of your spells carry positive energy with them.</p>\n<p>Effects that restore Hit Points to you take a status penalty equal to half your level (minimum 1) to the number of HP you recover. In addition, you can't be healed by magical effects originating from other creatures. However, if you are unconscious, magical effects can restore you to 1 HP (but no higher). You are affected normally by healing elixirs, potions, and other items.</p>\n<p>When you cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Heal]{Heal} and all your targets are living creatures, you roll d12s instead of d8s for the amount of healing.</p>\n<p>Whenever you finish casting a non-cantrip spell, you restore Hit Points equal to the spell level to your choice of either one target of the spell or the creature nearest to you. You can't heal yourself in this way. This healing has the healing, necromancy, and positive traits, as well as the tradition trait of the spell.</p>\n<p>Each time you use a spell slot to cast a 5th-level or higher spell that takes 2 or more actions to cast, you disperse positive energy in a 30-foot burst with the effects of a 3-action @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Heal]{Heal} spell with a level 4 lower than that of the spell you cast. This healing occurs immediately after you finish Casting the Spell. You don't benefit from this healing. Instead, you lose double the number of Hit Points rolled for the heal spell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Note: You need to apply the effects of this curse manually.</em></p>"
