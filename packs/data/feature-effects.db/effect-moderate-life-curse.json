In addition, you can't be healed by magical effects originating from other creatures. However, if you are unconscious, magical effects can restore you to 1 HP (but no higher). You are affected normally by healing elixirs, potions, and other items.</p>\n<p>When you cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Heal]{Heal}</em> and all your targets are living creatures, you roll d12s instead of d8s for the amount of healing.</p>\n<p>Whenever you finish casting a non-cantrip spell, you restore Hit Points equal to the spell level to your choice of either one target of the spell or the creature nearest to you. You can't heal yourself in this way. This healing has the healing, necromancy, and positive traits, as well as the tradition trait of the spell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Note: You need to apply the effects of this curse manually.</em></p>"
