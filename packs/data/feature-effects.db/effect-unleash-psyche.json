This applies only to spells that don't have a duration and that you cast using psychic spellcasting.</li>\n<li>You can use actions that have the psyche trait. After your unleashed psyche subsides, your mind must recover from the strain of channeling its full power. You can't use Unleash Psyche again for 2 rounds, and you're @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 2 rounds.</li>\n</ul>"
