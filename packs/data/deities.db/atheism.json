However, a good number of people choose not to worship any deities whatsoever. Many do so because of the value they place on freedomâ€”not being beholden to a deity means no limitations, no censure, no anathema, and no strictures. While this decision might sound amoral to some, for atheists, it can be motivated by a desire for autonomy and the right to choose one's own fate.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> none</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> none</p>"
