Originally a qlippoth lord, he was exiled by his peers for accepting mortal worshippers. Transformed into one of the demons he despises, Cyth-V'sug seeks to devour all life to put an end to demons and, ultimately, himself. He most often appears as an enormous draconic figure of snarled vines, fungal growths, and flailing tentacles. Cyth-V'sug is most often worshipped by recluses who seek to bring decay and destruction to their environs, though denizens of the Darklands also pay homage to him.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> Corrupt all that exists with parasites or fungus, promote the growth of fungus, feast on rotten flesh or fungus<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> Purify your food, cure a disease or kill a parasite, tolerate another demon lord or their servants [except @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Treerazer]{Treerazer})<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> disease, fungus, and parasites<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> CE</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Constitution or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Harm]{Harm}</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Nature</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Scimitar]{Scimitar}</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> change, decay, nature, plague</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Summon Plant or Fungus]{Summon Plant or Fungus}  2nd: @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Fungal Hyphae]{Fungal Hyphae}, 5th: @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Plant Form]{Plant Form}</div>\n</div>",
