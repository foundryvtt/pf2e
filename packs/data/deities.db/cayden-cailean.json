In his mortal years, Cayden was a sellsword of no small fame, known for his boisterous manner, skill with a blade, and fearless resolve. During a particularly rowdy night of drinking, a series of escalating dares led the wandering mercenary to attempt the Test of the Starstone. He emerged from the Starstone Cathedral 3 days later, laughing, a fully realized god. Divine responsibility did little to change Cayden's attitude from what it was in his mortal life. He continues to crave adventure, drink, and pleasurable company while abhorring bullies, tyrants, and cowards.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> drink, free slaves and aid the oppressed, seek glory and adventure</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> waste alcohol, be mean or standoffish when drunk, own a slave</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> ale, bravery, freedom, and wine</p>"
