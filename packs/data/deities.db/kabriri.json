According to legend, Kabriri is the reborn form of the first humanoid to devour his kin in life. His realm, Everglut, is connected to graveyards throughout the multiverse by a snarled network of tunnels that bring knowledge and sacrifices to the demon lord. Kabriri appears as a hulking ghoul with elven ears, teeth filed to points, an unnaturally long tongue, ashen skin, and cloven hooves. He is worshipped primarily by ghouls, ghasts, and lacedons.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> Eat the flesh of your own kind<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> Reveal secrets of the dead to nonbelievers, despoil grave markers<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> ghouls, graves, and secrets kept by the dead<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NE, CE</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Dexterity or Intelligence</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font</strong> harm</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Stealth</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> jaws or flail</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> indulgence, knowledge, undeath, vigil</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: jump, 2nd: expeditious excavation, 3rd: paralyze</div>\n</div>",
