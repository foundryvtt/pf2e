While the other deities began to create, Dahak chose to destroy. He is credited with transforming Hell into a place of agony and flame. He is also believed to be the creator of the metallic dragons, which he formed solely to hunt as sport. Seeing the destruction and chaos wrought, Apsu entered the Material Plane in order to end Dahak's reign of terror. However, Tiamat saw Dahak as a son and wanted him spared. In a deal to save Dahak, Tiamat healed some of the wounded metallic dragons. These dragons became the original chromatic dragons.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"title\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><strong>Edicts</strong> Kill metallic dragons, destroy things at your whim<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> Spare a foe after you have chosen to kill them, forgive a slight<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> CE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Strength or Constitution</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font</strong> harm</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Athletics</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> jaws or whip</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> destruction, fire, wyrmkin, zeal</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: magic fang, 3rd: fireball, 6th: dragon form (chromatic dragons only)</div>\n</div>",
