Born in Cheliax, she followed the path of the sword and fought evil, eventually becoming a paladin of Aroden's herald Arazni. She became a legend among the Shining Crusade, leading the Knights of Ozem in a series of victories over the Whispering Tyrant. Iomedae became the third known mortal to pass the Test of the Starstone when she ascended to divinity in 3832 AR. As Arazni had been slain during the Shining Crusade, Aroden elevated the newly ascended goddess to be his new herald. When Aroden himself died, Iomedae inherited most of his worshippers and became a major deity of honor and justice.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> be temperate, fight for justice and honor, hold valor in your heart</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> abandon a companion in need, dishonor yourself, refuse a challenge from an equal</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> honor, justice, rulership, and valor</p>"
