The Expanse is also home to Angazhan's most favored mortal servant, Ruthazek the Gorilla King, who leads the Spawn of Angazhan from his seat of power in the city of Usaro. It is not clear why the Mwangi Expanse has drawn the demon lord's attention to the region for so long, but Ruthazek is merely the latest of a long line of Gorilla Kings ruling Usaro, dating back to before humans began to dominate the continent of Garund. Each successive Gorilla King has been a brutal mortal reincarnated into the form of an awakened dire gorilla by one of Angazhan's totems after the death of their predecessor.</p>\n<p class=\"title\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><strong>Edicts</strong> Commit acts of brutal violence, test yourself against nature, make animals more dangerous<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> Cower from fights, allow yourself to be resurrected instead of reincarnated<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> CE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Strength or Constitution</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font</strong> harm</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Athletics</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> spear</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> destruction, might, nature, tyranny</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: magic fang, 3rd: animal form (ape only), 5th: moon frenzy</div>\n</div>\n<p></p>",
