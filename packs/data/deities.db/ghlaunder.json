He leaves malaise in his wake, laying waste to everything he can. Ghlaunder revels in suffering, especially that caused by sickness: the last gasp of air into fluid-filled lungs, the terrorizing dreams that come only from the hottest of fevers. It is said that the Gossamer King was once swaddled in a cocoon, but was released by the curious Desna into the world with a cleave of her starknife. Since then, the goddess has pursued him in a macabre dance, hoping to kill him as they flit between planes.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> corrupt pieces of land, water sources, and communities; infect the weak; spread and nurture disease</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> aid in ending a plague or infection, destroy something out of hand when you could have instead corrupted it or leeched off it first</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> infection, insects, parasites, and stagnation</p>"
