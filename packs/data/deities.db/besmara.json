After defeating and consuming rival spirits of battle, gold, and wood, she became a minor god of piracy, strife, and sea monsters.</p>\n<p>Besmara, the Pirate Queen, cuts a brash and bold figure, as she often is depicted wearing buccaneer apparel consisting of loose-fitting, eye-catching clothing and black boots, and her hair is wind-tossed on even the calmest day. She and her followers adhere to a simple code of greed: take what you desire, no matter who it might belong to. Despite this, Besmara and her worshippers are generally loyal to one another, knowing that while on the waves raiding ships for treasure, a pirate crew can survive only if its members trust one another.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> sail the seas, stay loyal to captain and crew, take what you want</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> betray shipmates, forsake piracy, settle on land</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> piracy, sea monsters, and strife</p>"
