Gogunta is worshipped as a goddess by boggards, who believe her to be an ascended mobogo, though scholars suspect she was a former hezrou who gained the favor of Dagon. Lending credence to this latter theory, her realm, a stinking salt marsh, is located within Dagon's oceanic realm. Gogunta appears as an enormous, multi-headed frog with dozens of eyes and even more tongues, though boggards typically depict her as a titanic boggard queen.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> sacrifice creatures by drowning them, frolic or sing in swamps, feed or aid amphibians</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> grant mercy to boggards who worship other gods</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> amphibians, boggards, and swamps</p>\n<p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> CE</p><h2>Devotee Benefits</h2><div><strong>Divine Font</strong> <em>harm</em><p><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Intimidation</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> whip</p>\n<p><strong>Domains</strong> indulgence, might, tyranny, water</p>\n<p><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: <em>jump</em>, 3rd: <em>stinking cloud</em>, 5th: <em>black tentacles</em></p></div>",
