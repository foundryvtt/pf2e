Gogunta is worshipped as a goddess by boggards, who believe her to be an ascended mobogo, though scholars suspect she was a former hezrou who gained the favor of Dagon. Lending credence to this latter theory, her realm, a stinking salt marsh, is located within Dagon&rsquo;s oceanic realm. Gogunta appears as an enormous, multi-headed frog with dozens of eyes and even more tongues, though boggards typically depict her as a titanic boggard queen.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> sacrifice creatures by drowning them, frolic or sing in swamps, feed or aid amphibians<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> grant mercy to boggards who worship other gods<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> amphibians, boggards, and swamps<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> CE</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><strong>Divine Font</strong> <em>harm</em><br /><strong>Divine Skill&nbsp;</strong>Intimidation<br /><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> whip<br /><strong>Domains</strong> indulgence, might, tyranny, water<br /><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: <em>jump</em>, 3rd: <em>stinking cloud</em>, 5th: <em>black tentacles</em></span></div>",
