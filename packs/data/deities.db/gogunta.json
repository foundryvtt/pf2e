Gogunta is worshipped as a goddess by boggards, who believe her to be an ascended mobogo, though scholars suspect she was a former hezrou who gained the favor of Dagon. Lending credence to this latter theory, her realm, a stinking salt marsh, is located within Dagon's oceanic realm. Gogunta appears as an enormous, multi-headed frog with dozens of eyes and even more tongues, though boggards typically depict her as a titanic boggard queen.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> sacrifice creatures by drowning them, frolic or sing in swamps, feed or aid amphibians</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> grant mercy to boggards who worship other gods</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> amphibians, boggards, and swamps</p>"
