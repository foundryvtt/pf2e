Some believe she was a construct who achieved consciousness and a spark of divinity, while others think she was a human alchemist and inventor who discovered ways to fuse mechanical components with her own physiology. Regardless of her origins, Brigh is a patient and thoughtful god who promotes unending curiosity and constant intellectual advancement. Her two most common forms are a humanoid woman made of bronze clockwork and a human woman wearing a bronze skullcap and armor composed of gears and other movable metal pieces. Though Brigh's usual demeanor is composed and reserved, she isn't an unfeeling automaton; she deeply cherishes the creations she and her followers make, and most of her worshippers feel the same way.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> craft new creations, pay attention to details, share achievements<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> carelessly destroy others' creations or research, enslave intelligent constructs, abuse constructs, refuse to acknowledge or learn from mistakes<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> clockwork, invention, and time<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, LN, N, CN, NE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Intelligence or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Harm]{Harm} or @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Heal]{Heal} </div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Crafting</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Light Hammer]{Light Hammer}</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> creation, earth, knowledge, time</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains</strong> fire</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Temporary Tool]{Temporary Tool}, 4th: @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Creation]{Creation}, 7th: @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Duplicate Foe]{Duplicate Foe}</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The Whisper in Bronze doesn't dole out punishments or rewards to her followers lightly.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Knowledge floods your mind. Once, you can reroll a failed skill check to Recall Knowledge; you must use the second result, even if it's worse.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You become a wellspring of invention. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Inventor]{Inventor} feat, even if you don't meet its prerequisites, and when you roll a Crafting check for the Inventor feat, you use the result one degree of success better than the result you rolled.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You gain the companionship of a loyal construct ally of Brigh's choice at least 1 level lower than you. If the construct is destroyed, it rebuilds itself over the course of a week, and as you gain levels, the construct upgrades and improves itself, becoming more powerful.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Your hands shake when attempting delicate work. All your failures to Craft or Repair items are instead critical failures.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Whenever you try to perform engineering or science tasks, everything just seems to explode. Whenever you attempt to create or use an alchemical item or a construct, Disable a Device, and so on, you must attempt a DC 15 flat check. On a failure, something explodes and you take 1d6 fire damage (or a different type of damage, if appropriate) per level of the item, construct, or device (DC 40 basic Reflex save).<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Constructs-even mindless constructs you thought you could control-seek your demise. All constructs are hostile to you and attack you when they notice your presence. Occasionally, inanimate statues and other objects animate as constructs to pursue Brigh's vengeance.</span></p>",
