She believes in preserving tradition and prefers innovation over the creation of something entirely new. She actively supports the preservation of elven culture through the protection of their art and historic buildings. While Findeladlara is a good goddess, she often comes off as aloof, particularly to younger, non-elven races. She is known to judge their work harshly and never answers the prayers of a non-elf.</p><p></span><strong>Edicts</strong> Preserve elven art and architecture, bless and secure households, inspire and aid others with your works</p><p><strong>Anathema</strong> Break the laws of hospitality, allow a guest to bring harm to your family</p><p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> twilight and traditional art and architecture</p><p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, CG, N, CN</span></p><p></span></p><h2>Devotee Benefits</h2><div><div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Intelligence or Charisma</div><div><strong>Divine Font</strong> heal</div><div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Crafting</div><div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> staff</div><div><strong>Domains</strong> cities, creation, family, star</div><div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: temporary tool, 4th: shape stone, 7th: magnificent mansion</div></div>",
