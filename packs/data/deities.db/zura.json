According to legend, she is the reincarnated form of an Azlanti queen who indulged in blood rites and acts of cannibalism in a quest for eternal life. After death, she was reborn as a unique vampiric succubus who quickly ascended to the status of demon lord. Though many of her cults died out with the Azlanti empire, Zura is still worshipped by vampires and those aspiring to become vampires, particularly within Cheliax and Ustalav, as well as among the drow of the Darklands.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Drink blood, seek vampirism, cause bleed damage</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Expose vampires, heal a bloody wound without drinking blood from it first</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> blood, cannibalism, and vampires</p>\n<p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NE, CE</p><h2>Devotee Benefits</h2><div><div><div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Strength or Charisma</div><div><strong>Divine Font</strong> harm</div><div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Diplomacy</div><div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> rapier</div><div><strong>Domains</strong> delirium, indulgence, nightmares, undeath</div><div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: charm, 4th: gaseous form, 6th: dominate</div></div></div>",
