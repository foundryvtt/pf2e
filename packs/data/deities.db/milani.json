Throughout Golarion, Milani is also known as the Everbloom, as the symbol of her church is a beautiful rose growing from blood-soaked soil.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> confront oppression in all its forms, defend the common folk, overcome despair to seize victory</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> abandon those in need, enslave or oppress others, harm the innocent through direct or inadvertent action</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> devotion, hope, and uprisings</p>\n<p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, CG, CN</p><h2>Devotee Benefits</h2><div><div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Strength or Wisdom</div><div><strong>Divine Font</strong> heal</div><div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Society</div><div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> morningstar</div><div><strong>Domains</strong> change, destruction, freedom, zeal</div><div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: mage armor, 3rd: enthrall, 4th: fire shield</div></div><h2>Divine Intercession</h2><p>The Everbloom rewards those who put the needs of others first, especially when combating oppressive forces, and she doesn't hesitate to impede any who enslave others or persecute the defenseless.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Boon</strong> Once, when you roll a failure on a Deception or Stealth check to protect an uprising from discovery, you critically succeed instead. Milani typically grants this boon for extremely significant checks on which the uprising's survival hinges.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderate Boon</strong> When you use it to protect others, your shield blooms with roses brimming with razor-sharp thorns. You gain the Shield Warden feat, even if you don't meet its prerequisites. If you already had that feat, if your shield takes damage from a melee Strike in defense of your ally, the attacker takes piercing damage equal to half the shield's Hardness.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Boon</strong> You gain +4 status bonus to checks to Request during attempts to satisfy one of Milani's edicts. Once per day, you can sound a battle cry that grants creatures within a 30-foot emanation the effects of freedom of movement and affects all doors, locks, containers, and other bindings used to restrain or imprison others with the effects of the knock spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Curse</strong> A magical wreath of thorny, bloodred roses endlessly grows from your scalp, no matter how much you try to remove it. You gain weakness 5 to piercing damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderate Curse</strong> Ropes, chains, manacles, and other equipment used to bind or constrain become blazing hot in your hands, bursting into flame or melting as if engulfed in a forge. When you attempt to hold such an item, you take 2d6 fire damage and the item is destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Curse</strong> Small wounds bleed more than seems physically possible. Whenever you take slashing or piercing damage, you also take @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Persistent Damage]{Persistent Bleed Damage} equal to the level of the creature or effect that inflicted the damage.</p>",
