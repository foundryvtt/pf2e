Most of her adventures in the lightless lands are lost to time and history, but she ultimately emerged reborn as a goddess, hailed as the first of the svirfneblin-uncanny underground gnomes with unique magical abilities and immunity to the dread Bleaching, a wasting curse that claims the lives of gnomes who succumb to boredom and ennui.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> take risks and savor the consequences whether good or ill, use stealth and guile over violence when dealing with the fallout from your risk-taking, learn the rules and strategies of games of chance played wherever you travel</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> break the established rules or terms of a wager, use violence to avoid the consequences of a wager</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> gambling, gems, gnomes, stealth</p>"
