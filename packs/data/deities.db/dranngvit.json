Dranngvit is a dwarven deity but is seen as a necessary evil rather than a beloved deity. Most pay her worship only when they know they have wronged someone. The only dwarves who choose her as their actually patron deity are normally those consumed by hatred and nothing else. Dranngvit may be the mother of Kols, but even if she is, Folgrit still treats Kols like a son.<br /><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><strong>Edicts</strong> Help reclaim just debts, seek appropriate vengeance against transgressions<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> Allow a slight to go unrecognized, avoid repaying a debt, force others into debts you know are unpayable<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LN, LE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Constitution or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font</strong> harm or heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Intimidation</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> light pick</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> knowledge, might, travel, vigil</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: longstrider, 2nd: knock, 5th: passwall</div>\n</div>",
