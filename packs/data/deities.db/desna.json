While the other gods toiled away to create the world, she set her sights on the heavens, placing each star in the sky. After surveying her artistry, she hung the brightest star high in the north and made it her home. Her first gift to mortals was this beacon of hope, a twinkling sign in the dark sky that they could turn to when lost or unsure of themselves. Desna provides safe passage through the darkness to all, should they choose to follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> aid fellow travelers, explore new places, express yourself through art and song, find what life has to offer</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> cause fear or despair, cast nightmare or use similar magic to corrupt dreams, engage in bigoted behavior</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> dreams, luck, stars, and travelers</p>"
