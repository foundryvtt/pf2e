Her first gift to mortals was this beacon of hope, a twinkling sign in the dark sky that they could turn to when lost or unsure of themselves. Desna provides safe passage through the darkness to all, should they choose to follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> aid fellow travelers, explore new places, express yourself through art and song, find what life has to offer</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> cause fear or despair, cast nightmare or use similar magic to corrupt dreams, engage in bigoted behavior</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> dreams, luck, stars, and travelers</p>"
