The Pale Kiss was created by Asmodeus as an object of adoration, with perfect form and beauty in the eyes of every creature. As a result, Belial has a virtually unlimited malleability of form, shifting between shapes almost constantly. His appearance is often as dualistic as his personality: half his body beautiful and half grotesque, much as he revels equally in pleasure and pain. As he is a creature of carnal desires, so are his followers: those who crave forbidden pleasures of the flesh but hide behind masks of respectability.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Indulge your basest desires, create deadly weapons</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Impede an act of high hedonism, become too attached to a lover or project</p>"
