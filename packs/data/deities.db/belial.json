The Pale Kiss was created by Asmodeus as an object of adoration, with perfect form and beauty in the eyes of every creature. As a result, Belial has a virtually unlimited malleability of form, shifting between shapes almost constantly. His appearance is often as dualistic as his personality: half his body beautiful and half grotesque, much as he revels equally in pleasure and pain. As he is a creature of carnal desires, so are his followers: those who crave forbidden pleasures of the flesh but hide behind masks of respectability.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> Indulge your basest desires, create deadly weapons<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> Impede an act of high hedonism, become too attached to a lover or project<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Intelligence or Charisma</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font</strong> harm</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Diplomacy</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> ranseur</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> change, passion, trickery, zeal</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: charm, 2nd: humanoid form, 3rd: enthrall</div>\n</div>",
