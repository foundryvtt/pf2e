Physically, it manifests as a twisting and vaguely serpentine-shaped mass of bone, hair, and fungus.</p><p>The Inmost Blot, as Xhamen-Dor is also known, exists to conquer worlds by infecting the living with itself. Its victims, the seeded, enact its will and seek to spread its influence until the entire world is just an extension of Xhamen-Dor itself. Then, once only the seeded remain, Xhamen-Dor uses the last of the planet's energy to return to Carcosa, which in turn absorbs the world Xhamen-Dor has brought to it, allowing Carcosa to slowly grow.</p><p><strong>Edicts</strong> Spread fungal growths, subtly infect others with knowledge of Xhamen-Dor</p><p><strong>Anathema</strong> None</p><p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NE, CE</span></p><p></span></p><h2>Devotee Benefits</h2><div><div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Constitution or Wisdom</div><div><strong>Divine Font</strong> harm</div><div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Nature</div><div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> spear</div><div><strong>Domains</strong> change, decay, dreams, nature</div><div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: summon plant or fungus, 3rd: wall of thorns, 7th: warp mind</div></div>",
