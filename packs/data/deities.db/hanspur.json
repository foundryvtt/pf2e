Hanspur is the god of the watery domains of the Sellen River and considers himself lord of all who travel his domain. As a travel god, his shrines always lie just outside the town gates. Despite this, he is still paid at least lip service by the peoples of the River Kingdoms, as he smites those who displease him by sinking their boats and flooding their lands. Hanspur considers dams that completely block a river to be unnatural.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Learn how to live off the river, guard river travelers from unnatural hazards, save others from drowning</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Impose needless laws or restrictions on others, aid daemons or the Horsemen</p>"
