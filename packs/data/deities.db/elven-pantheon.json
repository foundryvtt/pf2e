Elves have also adopted @Compendium[pf2e.deities.Alseta]{Alseta}, a minor goddess of doors and transitions, as their patron of teleportation and aiudara (commonly known as elf gates). Most elves value magic, beauty, freedom, and friendship as part of a fulfilling life and tend to worship all of the deities together as exemplars of these values. Alongside full-blooded elves, many half-elves-whether raised by elves or seeking a closer connection to their elven heritage- worship the elven pantheon.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> learn and appreciate traditional elven arts, crafts, and magic, explore the worlds outside and within</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> irreparably damage the natural environment (such as by overhunting or strip mining), have an unhealthy obsession or attachment</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> elves, magic, nature, tradition</p>"
