Despite his relatively young age, Trudd is the strongest deity in the dwarven pantheon, and as a result is often left to guard his father's halls while Torag is absent. For a dwarf, Trudd sports a remarkably short beard, spawning many tales, including one that he sold it for some unknown boon.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Offer your strength to aid others, protect those weaker than you</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Engage in petty showcases of strength, use your strength to take advantage of others</p>"
