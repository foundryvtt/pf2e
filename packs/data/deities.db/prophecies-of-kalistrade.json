The prophets of Kalistrade, often referred to as Kalistocrats, believe that achieving purity of body, mind, and spirit will lead to financial success, and thus they avoid certain foods and eschew contact with most persons and objects as impure. To avoid contamination and contact with nonbelievers they wear long, white gloves, and they wear distinctive, all-white clothing to represent their purity-often incorporating their symbol, a circle inside a triangle that is itself inscribed in a larger circle.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; width: 655.175px; padding: 0px; color: #1c1c1c; font-family: Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif; font-size: 15.6px; margin: var(--p-space, 1em) auto 0px auto;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Edicts</strong> accumulate personal wealth, foster and aid mercantile pursuits, welcome newcomers regardless of gender or ancestry</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; width: 655.175px; padding: 0px; color: #1c1c1c; font-family: Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif; font-size: 15.6px; margin: var(--p-space, 1em) auto 0px auto;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Anathema</strong> spend money frivolously; offer money to those who don't deserve wealth; overindulge in physical pleasures, food, or drink</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; width: 655.175px; padding: 0px; color: #1c1c1c; font-family: Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif; font-size: 15.6px; margin: var(--p-space, 1em) auto 0px auto;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Areas of Concern</strong> trade, wealth, self-denial, stability</p>"
