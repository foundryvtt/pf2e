Their true form, though similar, is rarely seen: an iridescent and golden protean with a halo of burning eyes but empty eye sockets. The protean lord of ascendance, keketars, and revelations rarely interacts with non-proteans, but to their protean worshippers, they offer exalted transformations and revelations that can change a being's entire outlook. Worshippers of Narriseminek, both mortal and protean, spend their time divining the future and using magic to transform their bodies-a practice they also extend to any other willing creatures who ask. Their revelations take the form of patterns emerging in otherwise random events; Narriseminek's followers reject astrology and other forms of divination based on predictable cycles.</p><p><strong>Edicts</strong> Divine the future, transform the bodies of willing creatures, rebel against organized structures</p><p><strong>Anathema</strong> Refuse to speak to a keketar, eschew a challenge by turning down a promotion or an advancement</p><p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> ascendance, keketars, and revelations</p><p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> CG, CN</span></p><p></span></p><h2>Devotee Benefits</h2><div><div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Dexterity or Wisdom</div><div><strong>Divine Font</strong> harm or heal</div><div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Occultism</div><div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> hatchet</div><div><strong>Domains</strong> delirium, freedom, knowledge, perfection</div><div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: mindlink, 4th: confusion, 5th: synesthesia</div></div>",
