Mind blank attempts to counteract any detection, revelation, and scrying effects as if its spell level were 1 higher than its actual level. On a success, the divination effect functions normally except that it detects nothing about the target and its possessions. For instance, detect magic would still detect other magic in the area, but not any magic on the target.</p>"
