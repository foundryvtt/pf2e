Freezing air emanates from your body, sending a chill down anyone's spine who draws too close and leaving a fine dusting of frost in your wake. As a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can change one of your chosen abilities to a different option from the list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ice Glide</strong> Ice trails from your feet for an instant as you move, allowing you to skate rapidly along the ice. You don't need to Balance on ice, and you ignore difficult terrain caused by ice or snow. While moving along a smooth surface, you gain a +20-foot status bonus to your land Speed.</li>\n</ul>"
