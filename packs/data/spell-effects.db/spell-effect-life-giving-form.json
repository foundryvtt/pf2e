This is a positive healing effect. You can't heal yourself with life-giving form. A creature harmed by positive damage (such as an undead) that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon instead takes [[/r 3d4 #positive]] positive damage, and it doesn't become temporarily immune.</p>\n<p>You can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Dismiss]{Dismiss} this spell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> Increase the Hit Points restored with an Interact action by [[/r 1d8]], the positive damage by 1, and the resistance and weakness by 1.</p>"
