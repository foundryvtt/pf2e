Freezing air emanates from your body, sending a chill down anyone's spine who draws too close and leaving a fine dusting of frost in your wake. As a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can change one of your chosen abilities to a different option from the list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Icy Claws</strong> Your hands morph into vicious, piercing claws of ice useful for attacking or climbing. As long as you have both hands free, you gain a climb Speed equal to your land Speed. You gain a claw unarmed attack with the agile and finesse traits, in the brawling weapon group. Your claw attack deals 1d6 piercing damage as its base damage, plus an additional 2d6 cold damage.</li>\n</ul>"
