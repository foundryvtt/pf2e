The air around you swelters with heat, and tiny sparks of flame dance behind you as you pass. As a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can change one of your chosen abilities to a different option from the list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enlarging Eruption</strong> You erupt in lava, which clings to you and hardens, causing your body to swell and burst until you grow to size Large. You're clumsy 1. Your reach increases by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if you started out Tiny), and you gain a +2 status bonus to melee damage. You can't choose this option if you're already Large or larger.</li>\n</ul>"
