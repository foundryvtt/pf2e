The tree deals [[/r 2d8[bludgeoning]]] damage to anyone beneath the tree when it drops and pushes them out of its space in a random direction. A creature that succeeds at a @Check[type:reflex|dc:18|traits:damaging-effect,hazard,mechanical,trap] save takes no damage and rolls out of the way in a random direction. On a critical success, it can choose the direction. Mounted creatures do not attempt a save unless their mount attempts a save and fails. If a mounted creature's mount fails the save, the mounted creature can attempt its own @Check[type:reflex|dc:18|name:Mounted Deadfall|traits:damaging-effect,hazard,mechanical,trap] save by leaping off its mount, taking [[/r 1d4[bludgeoning]]] damage from the fall. This damage is taken whether the save is successful or not.</p>"
