If it's is a creature, it might be an eclectic creature like a fey; if a deity, it might be Desna or Calistria. As a bard with a polymath muse, you are interested in a wide array of topics but rarely dedicated to any one, and you rarely make up your mind-you want to try everything. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Versatile Performance] feat and add <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Unseen Servant]</em> to your spell repertoire.</p>"
