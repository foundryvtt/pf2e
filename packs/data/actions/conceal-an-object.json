Once the GM rolls your check for a concealed object, that same result is used no matter how many passive observers you try to sneak it past. If a creature is specifically searching you for an item, it can attempt a Perception check against your Stealth DC (finding the object on success).</p>\n<p>You can also conceal an object somewhere other than your person, such as among undergrowth or in a secret compartment within a piece of furniture. In this case, characters Seeking in an area compare their Perception check results to your Stealth DC to determine whether they find the object.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The object remains undetected.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The searcher finds the object.</p>"
