For instance, you might be able to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} and @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1OagaWtBpVXExToo]{Recall Knowledge} about the subject, but you likely couldn&rsquo;t cast a spell targeting a different creature. This condition ends if a creature uses hostile actions against you or any of your allies.</p>",
