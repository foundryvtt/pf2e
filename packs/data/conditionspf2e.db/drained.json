    "content": "<p>When a creature successfully drains you of blood or life force, you become less healthy. Drained always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to your drained value on Constitution-based checks, such as Fortitude saves. You also lose a number of Hit Points equal to your level (minimum 1) times the drained value, and your maximum Hit Points are reduced by the same amount. For example, if you&rsquo;re hit by an effect that inflicts drained 3 and you&rsquo;re a 3rd-level character, you lose 9 Hit Points and reduce your maximum Hit Points by 9. Losing these Hit Points doesn&rsquo;t count as taking damage.<br /><br />Each time you get a full night&rsquo;s rest, your drained value decreases by 1. This increases your maximum Hit Points, but you don&rsquo;t immediately recover the lost Hit Points.</p>",
