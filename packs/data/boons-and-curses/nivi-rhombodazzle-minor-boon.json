Once, instead of attempting the check you would normally roll, you attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:11] with the same results. Nivi always grants this boon when the odds are stacked against you (though this same effect is an alternate to her minor curse if she uses it for a check when you would have been very likely to succeed).</p>"
