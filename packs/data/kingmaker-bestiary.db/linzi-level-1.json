                    "value": "<p><em>Claiming no place as their own, halflings control few settlements larger than villages. Instead, they frequently live among humans within the walls of larger cities, carving out small communities alongside taller folk. Many halflings lead perfectly fulfilling lives in the shadows of their larger neighbors, while others prefer a nomadic existence, traveling the world and taking advantage of opportunities and adventures as they come.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Optimistic and cheerful, blessed with uncanny luck, and driven by powerful wanderlust, halflings make up for their short stature with an abundance of bravado and curiosity. At once excitable and easygoing, they are the best kind of opportunists, and their passions favor joy over violence. Even in the jaws of danger, halflings rarely lose their sense of humor.</p>\n<p>Many taller people dismiss halflings due to their size or, worse, treat them like children. Halflings use these prejudices and misconceptions to their advantage, gaining access to opportunities and performing deeds of daring mischief or heroism. A halfling's curiosity is tempered by wisdom and caution, leading to calculated risks and narrow escapes.</p>\n<p>While their wanderlust and curiosity sometimes drive them toward adventure, halflings also carry strong ties to house and home, often spending above their means to achieve comfort in their homelife.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who must contend with these opposing drives toward adventure and comfort, you should play a halfling.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Get along well with a wide variety of people and enjoy meeting new friends.</li>\n<li>Find it difficult to resist indulging your curiosity, even when you know it's going to lead to trouble.</li>\n<li>Hold a deep and personal hatred of the practice of slavery and devote yourself to freeing those who still labor against their will.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate your ability to always find a silver lining or something to laugh about, no matter how dire the situation.</li>\n<li>Think you bring good luck with you.</li>\n<li>Underestimate your strength, endurance, and fighting prowess.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Halflings are short humanoids who look vaguely like smaller humans. They rarely grow to be more than 3 feet in height. Halfling proportions vary, with some looking like shorter adult humans with slightly larger heads and others having proportions closer to those of a human child.</p>\n<p>Most halflings prefer to walk barefoot rather than wearing shoes, and those who do so develop roughly calloused soles on their feet over time. Tufts of thick, often-curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet. Halfling skin tones tend toward rich, tawny shades like amber or oak, and their hair color ranges from a light golden blond to raven black.</p>\n<p>Halflings reach physical adulthood around the age of 20. A typical halfling can live to be around 150 years old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Despite their jovial and friendly nature, halflings don't usually tend to congregate. They have no cultural homeland in the Inner Sea region, and they instead weave themselves throughout the societies of the world. Halflings eke out whatever living they can manage, many performing menial labor or holding simple service jobs. Some halflings reject city life, instead turning to the open road and traveling from place to place in search of fortune and fame. These nomadic halflings often travel in small groups, sharing hardships and simple pleasures among close friends and family.</p>\n<p>Wherever halflings go, they seamlessly blend into the society they find themselves in, adapting to the culture of the predominant ancestry around them and adding their uniquely halfling twists, creating a blend of cultural diffusion that enriches both cultures.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Halflings are loyal to their friends and their family, but they aren't afraid to do what needs to be done in order to survive. Halfling alignments vary, typically closely in keeping with the alignment of the other ancestries that live around them. Halflings favor gods that either grant luck, like Desna, or encourage guile, like Norgorber, and many appreciate Cayden Cailean's role as a liberator, as well as any religions common among other ancestries around them.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Halflings' natural wanderlust and opportunistic nature make them ideal adventurers. Many people put up with their vivacious attitudes in return for the natural talents they provide and the popular superstition that traveling with a halfling is good luck.</p>\n<p>Typical backgrounds for halflings include acrobat, criminal, emissary, entertainer, laborer, and street urchin. Halflings make great clerics and rogues, but many also become monks or rangers.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Halfling names are usually two to three syllables, with a gentle sound that avoids hard consonants. Preferring their names to sound humble, halflings see overly long or complex names as a sign of arrogance. This goes only for their own people, howeverâ€”halflings have names that suit them, and they understand that elves and humans might have longer names to suit their own aesthetics. Humans in particular have a tendency to refer to halflings by nicknames, with 'Lucky' being common to the point of absurdity.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Anafa, Antal, Bellis, Boram, Etune, Filiu, Jamir, Kaleb, Linna, Marra, Miro, Rillka, Sistra, Sumak, Yamyra</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-underline-header);\">Halfling Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Strength</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Halfling</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Compositions are a special type of spell that often require you to use the Performance skill when casting them. Composition spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, write a new composition, or otherwise engage your muse.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>You learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Counter Performance]{Counter Performance}</em> composition spell, protecting against auditory and visual effects.</p>\n<h3>Composition Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Composition cantrips are special composition spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can use them as often as you like. Composition cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list. Generally, only feats can give you more composition cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out composition cantrips gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining. You learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Inspire Courage]{Inspire Courage}</em> composition cantrip, which boosts your allies' attacks, damage, and defense against fear.</p>"

Compositions are a special type of spell that often require you to use the Performance skill when casting them. Composition spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, write a new composition, or otherwise engage your muse.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>You learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Counter Performance]{Counter Performance}</em> composition spell, protecting against auditory and visual effects.</p>\n<h3><strong>Composition Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Composition cantrips are special composition spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can use them as often as you like. Composition cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list. Generally, only feats can give you more composition cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out composition cantrips gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining. You learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Inspire Courage]{Inspire Courage}</em> composition cantrip, which boosts your allies' attacks, damage, and defense against fear.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Muses</h2>\n<p>As a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads you to great things, and might be a physical creature, a deity, a philosophy, or a captivating mystery.</p>\n<p>Muses can be found here: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Maestro]{Maestro}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Polymath]{Polymath}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Enigma]{Enigma}, and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Warrior]{Warrior}.</p>\n<h2>Occult Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You draw upon magic from esoteric knowledge. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a bard, you can usually play an instrument for spells requiring somatic or material components, as long as it takes at least one of your hands to do so. If you use an instrument, you don't need a spell component pouch or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for spells requiring verbal components, instead of speaking.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3-6: Bard Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* The magnum opus class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level occult spells of your choice and five occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3-6), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Bard Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank in Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Great Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Bard Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 damage if you're a master, and 4 damage if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You've mastered the occult. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure at a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your command of occult magic is the stuff of legends. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Magnum Opus<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have tuned your spellcasting to the highest caliber. Add two common 10th-level occult spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using bard spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>"

You can wear just that padded armor or undercoat to sleep in, if your heavy armor is destroyed, or when otherwise not wearing the full heavy armor.
