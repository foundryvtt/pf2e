As long as the curse persists, a creature cannot recover from the disease, and removing the curse does not automatically remove the disease element of the affliction. Both elements must be dealt with individually before a victim suffering from Lamashtu's Bloom is safe. As with all elements of this curse, slaying the bloom of Lamashtu in area <strong>C10</strong> automatically removes this affliction.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> @Check[type:fortitude|dc:23]</p>\n<p><strong>Onset</strong> 1 week</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> no ill effects (1 day)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} (1 day)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong> enfeebled 1 and [[/r 2d6[poison]]] damage (8 hours)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 4</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Unconscious]{Unconscious} and [[/r 4d6[poison]]] damage (10 minutes)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 5</strong> death; Special a creature that dies from Lamashtu's bloom explodes in a blast of First World foliage, releasing a monster.
