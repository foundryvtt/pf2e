                    "value": "<p><em>The convoluted histories other people cling to don't interest goblins. These small folk live in the moment, and they prefer tall tales over factual records. The wars of a few decades ago might as well be from the ancient past. Misunderstood by other people, goblins are happy how they are. Goblin virtues are about being present, creative, and honest. They strive to lead fulfilled lives, rather than worrying about how their journeys will end. To tell stories, not nitpick the facts. To be small, but dream big.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Goblins have a reputation as simple creatures who love songs, fire, and eating disgusting things and who hate reading, dogs, and horses—and there are a great many for whom this description fits perfectly. However, great changes have come to goblinkind, and more and more goblins resist conformity to these stereotypes. Even among goblins that are more worldly, many still exemplify their old ways in some small manner, just to a more sensible degree. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire or fearlessly devour a meal that might turn others' stomachs. Others are endless tinkerers and view their companions' trash as the components of gadgets yet to be made.</p>\n<p>Though goblins' culture has splintered radically, their reputation has changed little. As such, goblins who travel to larger cities are frequently subjected to derision, and many work twice as hard at proving their worth.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is eccentric, enthusiastic, and fun-loving, you should play a goblin.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to prove that you have a place among other civilized peoples, perhaps even to yourself.</li>\n<li>Fight tooth and nail—sometimes literally—to protect yourself and your friends from danger.</li>\n<li>Lighten the heavy emotional burdens others carry (and amuse yourself) with antics and pranks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Work to ensure you don't accidentally (or intentionally) set too many things on fire.</li>\n<li>Assume you can't—or won't—read.</li>\n<li>Wonder how you survive given your ancestry's typical gastronomic choices, reckless behavior, and love of fire.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Goblins are stumpy humanoids with large bodies, scrawny limbs, and massively oversized heads with large ears and beady red eyes. Their skin ranges from green to gray to blue, and they often bear scars, boils, and rashes. Goblins average 3 feet tall. Most are bald, with little or no body hair. Their jagged teeth fall out and regrow constantly, and their fast metabolism means they eat constantly and nap frequently. Mutations are also more common among goblins than other peoples, and goblins usually view particularly salient mutations as a sign of power or fortune.</p>\n<p>Goblins reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood 4 or 5 years later. Goblins can live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Goblins tend to flock to strong leaders, forming small tribes. These tribes rarely number more than a hundred, though the larger a tribe is, the more diligent the leader must be to keep order—a notoriously difficult task. As new threats rise across the Inner Sea region, many tribal elders have put aside their reckless ways in the hope of forging alliances that offer their people a greater chance at survival. Play and creativity matter more to goblins than productivity or study, and their encampments erupt with songs and laughter.</p>\n<p>Goblins bond closely with their allies, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them or offered a sympathetic ear. Goblins tend to assume for their own protection that members of taller ancestries, which goblins often refer to colloquially as 'longshanks,' won't treat them kindly. Learning to trust longshanks is difficult for a goblin, and it's been only in recent years that such a partnership has even been an option. However, their attitude as a people is changing rapidly, and their short lifespans and poor memories help them adapt quickly.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Even well-intentioned goblins have trouble following the rules, meaning they're rarely lawful. Most goblin adventurers are chaotic neutral or chaotic good. Organized worship confounds goblins, and most of them would rather pick their own deities, choosing powerful monsters, natural wonders, or anything else they find fascinating. Longshanks might have books upon books about the structures of divinity, but to a goblin, anything can be a god if you want it to. Goblins who spend time around people of other ancestries might adopt some of their beliefs, though, and many goblin adventurers adopt the worship of Cayden Cailean.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>To some degree, almost every goblin is an adventurer, surviving life on the edge using skill and wits. Goblins explore and hunt for treasures by nature, though some become true adventurers in their own rights, often after being separated from their group or tribe.</p>\n<p>Goblins often have the acrobat, criminal, entertainer, gladiator, hunter, and street urchin backgrounds. Consider playing an alchemist, since many goblins love fire, or a bard, since many goblins love songs. As scrappy survivors, goblins are often rogues who dart about the shadows, though their inherently charismatic nature also draws them to the pursuit of magical classes such as sorcerer.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Goblins keep their names simple. A good name should be easy to pronounce, short enough to shout without getting winded, and taste good to say. The namer often picks a word that rhymes with something they like so that writing songs is easier. Since there aren't any real traditions regarding naming in goblin culture, children often name themselves once they're old enough to do something resembling talking.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Ak, Bokker, Frum, Guzmuk, Krobby, Loohi, Mazmord, Neeka, Omgot, Ranzak, Rickle, Tup, Wakla, Yonk, Zibini</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-underline-header);\">Goblin Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Goblin</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

At 1st level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sneak Attack</h2>\n<p>When your enemy can't properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage. If you Strike a creature that has the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, or a ranged weapon attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse.</p>\n<p>As your rogue level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Surprise Attack</h2>\n<p>You spring into combat faster than foes can react. On the first round of combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven't acted are flat-footed to you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Deny Advantage<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>As someone who takes advantage of others' defenses, you are careful not to leave such openings yourself. You aren't flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the initial ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Tricks<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly familiar with the tools of your trade. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, as well as the rapier, sap, shortbow, and shortsword. When you critically succeed at an attack roll against a flat-footed creature while using an agile or finesse simple weapon or any of the listed weapons, you apply the critical specialization effect for the weapon you're wielding.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragons' breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 damage if you're a master, and 4 damage if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Debilitating Strikes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>When taking advantage of an opening, you both hinder and harm your foe. You gain the Debilitating Strike free action.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Debilitating Strike]{Debilitating Strike} <span class=\"pf2-icon\">F</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your Strike hits a flat-footed creature and deals damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You apply one of the following debilitations, which lasts until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Debilitation</strong> The target takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Debilitation</strong> The target becomes enfeebled 1.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Great Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Rogue Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your techniques are now harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your rogue class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Improved Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You elude danger to a degree that few can match. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Incredible Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You notice things almost impossible for an ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor.

When you use Debilitating Strike, you can apply two debilitations simultaneously; removing one removes both.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Slippery Mind<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You play mental games and employ cognitive tricks to throw off mind-altering effects.
