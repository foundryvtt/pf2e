After the tenets of evil, add these tenets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must not bind yourself with any law or oath beyond that of your code (though you can still select a champion feat with the oath trait). Act dishonorably, take advantage of others, lie, cheat, and steal to get what you want.</li>\n<li>You must destroy that which offends you and that which stands in your way, including-and perhaps especially-the forces of good and law that oppose you. This tenet doesn't force you to take action immediately if it could mean your destruction, nor does it require you to destroy something that might be useful if corrupted toward your ends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Champion's Reaction</h2>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-weight: 500;\">@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Destructive Vengeance]{Destructive Vengeance} <span class=\"pf2-icon\">r</span></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An enemy within 15 feet damages you</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Bloodshed begets bloodshed as you drag your enemy toward oblivion.
