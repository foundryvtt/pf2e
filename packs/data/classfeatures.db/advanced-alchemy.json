For each batch of infused reagents you spend, choose an alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book, and make a batch of two of that item.</p>\n<p>These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.</p>"
