If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose a school in which to specialize. You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your school.</p>\n<p>If you don't choose a school, you're a universalist, a wizard who believes the path to true knowledge of magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater flexibility.</p>\n<p>As an abjurer, you master the art of protection, strengthening defenses, preventing attacks, and even turning magic against itself. You understand that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. You add one 1st-level abjuration spell (such as <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Feather Fall]{Feather Fall}</em>) to your spellbook. You learn the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Protective Ward]{Protective Ward}</em> school spell.</p>"
