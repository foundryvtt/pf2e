Your racket shapes your rogue techniques and the way you approach a job, while building your reputation in the criminal underworld for a certain type of work. A client with deep pockets might even hire a team of rogues for a particular heist, each specializing in a different racket, in order to cover all the bases.</p>\n<p>You use fast-talking, flattery, and a silver tongue to avoid danger and escape tricky situations. You might be a grifter or con artist, traveling from place to place with a new story or scheme. Your racket is also ideal for certain reputable professions, like barrister, diplomat, or politician.</p>\n<p>When you successfully @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Feint]{Feint}, the target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} against melee attacks you attempt against it until the end of your next turn. On a critical success, the target is flat-footed against all melee attacks until the end of your next turn, not just yours.</p>\n<p>You're trained in Deception and Diplomacy. You can choose Charisma as your key ability score.</p>"
