            "value": "<p>The powers of your mystery manifest in the form of revelation spells, which are a type of focus spell. Casting a revelation spell costs 1 Focus Point and increases the effects of your @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Oracular Curse]{Oracular Curse}. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to reconcile the conflicting or unconventional nature of your divine mystery.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots (see @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Divine Spellcasting (Oracle)]{Divine Spellcasting (Oracle)}). Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>Revelation spells have the cursebound trait, unlike other focus spells. This trait means they increase the severity of your oracular curse (see below) when cast. You can't cast a cursebound spell if you don't have an oracular curse.You learn two revelation spells at 1st level. The first is an initial revelation spell determined by your mystery. The second is an initial domain spell you select from one of the domains associated with your mystery, which you cast as a revelation spell, causing it to gain the cursebound trait.</p>"
