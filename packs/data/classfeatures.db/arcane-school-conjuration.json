If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose a school in which to specialize. You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your school.</p>\n<p>If you don't choose a school, you're a universalist, a wizard who believes the path to true knowledge of magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater flexibility.</p>\n<p>As a conjurer, you summon creatures and objects from places beyond, and use magic to transport to distant locales. You understand that the true key to victory is strength in numbers. You add one 1st-level conjuration spell (such as <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Summon Animal]{Summon Animal}</em>) to your spellbook. You learn the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Augment Summoning]{Augment Summoning}</em> school spell.</p>"
