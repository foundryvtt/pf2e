If it's is a creature, it might be an eclectic creature like a fey; if a deity, it might be Desna or Calistria. As a bard with a polymath muse, you are interested in a wide array of topics but rarely dedicated to any one, and you rarely make up your mind-you want to try everything. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Versatile Performance]{Versatile Performance} feat and add @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Unseen Servant]{Unseen Servant} to your spell repertoire.</p>"
