You might even work as a consultant, testing clients' defenses by trying to steal something precious.</p>\n<p>When a fight breaks out, you prefer swift, lightweight weapons, and you strike where it hurts. When you attack with a finesse melee weapon, you can add your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls instead of your Strength modifier.</p>\n<p>You are trained in Thievery.</p>"
