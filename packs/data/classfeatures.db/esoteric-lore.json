Unlike a normal Lore skill, you use Charisma as your modifier on Esoteric Lore checks. You also gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Dubious Knowledge]{Dubious Knowledge} skill feat.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you become an expert in Esoteric Lore; at 7th level, you become a master in Esoteric Lore; and at 15th level, you become legendary in Esoteric Lore.</p>"
