You might be a solitary thief, performing burglaries that can't be explained by skill alone, or a specialist called in by other rogues to deal with magical security measures. You might even be on the up-and-up, hired to test magical defenses or even build them yourself.</p>\n<p>Choose a multiclass archetype that has a basic, expert, and master spellcasting feat. You gain that archetype's dedication feat as a bonus feat even though you don't meet its level prerequisite, though you must meet its other prerequisites. For you, the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Magical Trickster]{Magical Trickster} rogue feat has a prerequisite of 2nd level instead of 4th level. You can choose the spellcasting ability score for the multiclass archetype you chose as your key ability score.</p>"
