When using a batch of @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Infused Reagents]{Infused Reagents} to create your signature items using @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Advanced Alchemy]{Advanced Alchemy}, you create three items instead of two. Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature items with another formula in your formula book. This new signature item must be on your research field's list of possible signature items.</p>\n<p>As long as your proficiency rank in Medicine is trained or better, you can attempt a Crafting check instead of a Medicine check for any of Medicine's untrained and trained uses.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Field Discovery (Chirurgeon)]{Field Discovery}<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>When using Advanced Alchemy to make elixirs of life during your daily preparations, you can create three elixirs with each batch of reagents instead of two.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Perpetual Infusions (Chirurgeon)]{Perpetual Infusions}<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You have learned how to create perpetual alchemical infusions that can provide a near-infinite supply of certain simple items.
