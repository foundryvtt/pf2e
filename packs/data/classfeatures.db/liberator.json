If the trigger was an ally taking damage, the ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. The ally can attempt to break free of effects grabbing, restraining, immobilizing, or paralyzing them. They either attempt a new save against one such effect that allows a save, or attempt to Escape from one effect as a free action. If they can move, the ally can Step as a free action, even if they didn't need to escape.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Divine Smite<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You punish those who ensnare your allies in bondage. If the triggering enemy was using any effects to make your ally grabbed, restrained, immobilized, or paralyzed when you used Liberating Step, that enemy takes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Persistent Damage]{Persistent Good Damage} equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Exalt<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You can help your whole group get into position.
