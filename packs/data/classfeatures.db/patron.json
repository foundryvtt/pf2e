This entity is typically mysterious and distant, revealing little of their identity and motivations, and they grant you spells and other magical powers through a familiar, which serves as a conduit for their power.</p>\n<p>A patron might be a deity or demigod, a coven of powerful hags, a fey lord, an archdevil, or a similarly powerful entity, or perhaps multiple such figures workingin tandem. As you gain more of your patron's power, you might learn more about who or what they are-certain combinations of themes and lessons suggest particular patrons or agendas-but patrons empower witches for their own secretive reasons, which they rarely reveal in full.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, choose your patron's theme, which determines your spellcasting tradition, a skill, a special cantrip you gain, and a spell added to your familiar.</p>"
