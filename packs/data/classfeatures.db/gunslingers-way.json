You also gain advanced and greater deeds at later levels, as well as access to way-specific feats.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Way of the Drifter]{Way of the Drifter}</strong> You wander across the battlefield, equally at home in and out of the fray.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Way of the Pistolero]{Way of the Pistolero}</strong> You carefully maintain your distance at a duelist's 10 paces with pistol in hand.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Way of the Sniper]{Way of the Sniper}</strong> You practice a methodical style of shooting, striking from far cover.</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Way of the Vanguard]{Way of the Vanguard}</strong> You rely on a brutal combat style that uses heavy weapons and explosive attacks.</p>"
