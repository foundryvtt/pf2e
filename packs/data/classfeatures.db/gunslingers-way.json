At 1st level, your way grants you an initial deed, a unique reload action called a slinger's reload, and proficiency with a particular skill. You also gain advanced and greater deeds at later levels, as well as access to way-specific feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Drifter:</strong> You wander across the battlefield, equally at home in and out of the fray.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Pistolero:</strong> You carefully maintain your distance at a duelist's 10 paces with pistol in hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Sniper:</strong> You practice a methodical style of shooting, striking from far cover.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Vanguard:</strong> You rely on a brutal combat style that uses heavy weapons and explosive attacks.</p>"
