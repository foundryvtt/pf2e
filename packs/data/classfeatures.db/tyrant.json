You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Iron Command]{Iron Command} champion's reaction and the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Touch of Corruption]{Touch of Corruption} devotion spell. After the tenets of evil, add these tenets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let no one who is lesser than you wield power over you or lead you.</li>\n<li>Mercilessly enforce established hierarchies of masters and servants. Topple or seize control of illegitimate hierarchies, such as democratic governments or the arrogant echelons of the celestial planes, and fill power vacuums by taking that power for yourself.</li>\n<li>Bind the weak to serve you. This tenet doesn't require you to spare foes' lives if you think they would be disloyal if pressed into servitude, nor does it require you to keep more servants than you find practical or useful.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Champion's Reaction</h2>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><span style=\"color: var(--body); font-size: 14px;\">@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Iron Command]{Iron Command} <span class=\"pf2-icon\">R</span></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An enemy within 15 feet damages you</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You put an impertinent foe who dared harm you in their proper place. You command your enemy to kneel before you in obedience. If they dare to refuse, they must pay the price in pain and anguish. The foe must choose one of the following options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The enemy kneels, dropping @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Prone]{Prone} as a free action.</li>\n<li>The enemy refuses, and you deal 1d6 mental damage to it. This damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 9th level, 4d6 at 12th level, 5d6 at 16th level, and 6d6 at 19th level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, your @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Strike]{Strikes} against the triggering creature deal 1 extra damage until the end of your next turn. You choose whether the damage type is evil or negative each time you use this reaction. This extra damage increases to 2 at 9th level and 3 at 16th level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Divine Smite<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>The regrets of disobedience linger. If an enemy refuses your Iron Command, it takes persistent evil damage equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Exalt<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>When you use Iron Command, each enemy within 15 feet of you other than the triggering creature must also either drop prone or take mental damage (the enemy chooses). These creatures take only minimum damage (typically 3 damage at 11th level, 4 at 12th, 5 at 16th, and 6 at 19th), and the effects they take can't be adjusted by anything that changes your Iron Command.</p>\n<p>For instance, the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Iron Repercussions]{Iron Repercussions} feat couldn't turn the damage into persistent mental damage for creatures other than the triggering creature.</p>"
