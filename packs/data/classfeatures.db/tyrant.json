You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Iron Command]{Iron Command} champion's reaction and the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Touch of Corruption]{Touch of Corruption} devotion spell. After the tenets of evil, add these tenets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let no one who is lesser than you wield power over you or lead you.</li>\n<li>Mercilessly enforce established hierarchies of masters and servants. Topple or seize control of illegitimate hierarchies, such as democratic governments or the arrogant echelons of the celestial planes, and fill power vacuums by taking that power for yourself.</li>\n<li>Bind the weak to serve you. This tenet doesn't require you to spare foes' lives if you think they would be disloyal if pressed into servitude, nor does it require you to keep more servants than you find practical or useful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>DIVINE SMITE 9TH</strong></p>\n<p>Your champion's reaction improves as follows.</p>\n<p><strong>Tyrant:</strong> The regrets of disobedience linger. If an enemy refuses your Iron Command, it takes persistent evil damage equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>EXALT 11TH</strong></p>\n<p>Your champion's reaction improves in the following ways when you gain the exalt class feature at 11th level. These affect enemies rather than allies, as they exalt your dark god to bring pain upon your foes instead of uplifting your companions.</p>\n<p>Tyrant: When you use Iron Command, each enemy within 15 feet of you other than the triggering creature must also either drop prone or take mental damage (the enemy chooses). These creatures take only minimum damage (typically 3 damage at 11th level, 4 at 12th, 5 at 16th, and 6 at 19th), and the effects they take can't be adjusted by anything that changes your Iron Command.</p>\n<p>For instance, the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Iron Repercussions]{Iron Repercussions} feat couldn't turn the damage into persistent mental damage for creatures other than the triggering creature.</p>"
