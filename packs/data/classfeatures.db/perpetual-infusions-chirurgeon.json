The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you can swap any number of your perpetual infusions with other eligible infusions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Choose two 1st-level elixirs with the healing trait. If a creature heals Hit Points from a perpetual infusion, that creature is temporarily immune to healing Hit Points from subsequent perpetual infusions for 10 minutes (but not immune to any other effects of those infusions).</p>"
