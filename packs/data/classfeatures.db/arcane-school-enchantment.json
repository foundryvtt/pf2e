If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose a school in which to specialize. You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your school.</p>\n<p>If you don't choose a school, you're a universalist, a wizard who believes the path to true knowledge of magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater flexibility.</p>\n<p>As an enchanter, you use magic to manipulate others' minds. You might use your abilities to subtly influence others or seize control over them. You understand that the mind surpasses matter. You add one 1st-level enchantment spell (such as <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Charm]{Charm}</em>) to your spellbook. You learn the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Charming Words]{Charming Words}</em> school spell.</p>"
