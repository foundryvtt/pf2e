You might have had a brush with death yourself-maybe even dying and returning to life-or carry the touch of undeath in your blood. If you commune with deities, you might speak with guardians of death like Pharasma and the psychopomp ushers (the most powerful among creatures that guide souls through the afterlife); a bringer of death like the Mantis God Achaekek or the Horseman of the Apocalypse Charon; or a herald of undeath such as Urgathoa.</p>\n<h3>Curse of Living Death</h3>\n<p>Your body is slowly decaying even though you are alive, and using your powers furthers this unnatural living death. You carry a touch of the grave about you, manifesting as bloodless pallor, a faint smell of earth, or deathly cold skin.</p>"
