            "value": "<h2>Psychic Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You access the vast well of power that resides within your own mind, calling forth psychic magic with nothing but thought and will. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You alter some of the standard spell components when casting spells you know from your psychic spellcasting. Instead of speaking, you substitute any verbal components with a special mental component determined by your subconscious mind class feature. This represents how you exert your mind toward your intended effect. Any of these components impart the concentrate trait to the spell you're casting. You also substitute any material components with somatic components, though these tend to be simple movements of the hand or head compared to those used by other spellcasters. Your spells still have clear and noticeable visual and auditory manifestations, as normal for a spellcaster.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a psychic, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Psychic Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is determined by your subconscious mind, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use the modifier for the ability stated in your subconscious mind.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of psychic spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level psychic, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level psychic, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<p>As a psychic, you get the ability to improve some of your cantrips with special benefits and psi amps. Over the course of your career, your choice of conscious mind class feature gives you extra cantrips, benefits and psi amps for cantrips, and a collection of unique psi cantrips.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\"><caption>Psychic Spells per Day</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1†</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2†</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* Your conscious mind gives you three additional cantrips with amps.
