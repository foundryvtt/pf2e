If you choose to deal negative or positive damage, your weapon or unarmed attack gains the effects of the ghost touch property rune, which makes it more effective against incorporeal creatures, and your Rage action gains the divine and necromancy traits, plus negative or positive, as appropriate.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Specialization Ability</h2>\n<p>When using spirit rage, increase the damage from Rage from 3 to 7.
