If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose a school in which to specialize. You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your school.</p>\n<p>If you don't choose a school, you're a universalist, a wizard who believes the path to true knowledge of magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater flexibility.</p>\n<p>As a diviner, you master remote viewing and prescience, learning information that can transform investigations, research, and battle strategies. You understand that knowledge is power. You add one 1st-level divination spell (such as <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.True Strike]{True Strike}</em>) to your spellbook. You learn the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Diviner's Sight]{Diviner's Sight}</em> school spell.</p>"
