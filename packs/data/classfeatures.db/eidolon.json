            "value": "<p>You have a connection with a powerful and usually otherworldly entity called an eidolon, and you can use your life force as a conduit to manifest this ephemeral entity into the mortal world. Magic also flows through this conduit from your eidolon into you, so your eidolon determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose from (as described in Summoner Spellcasting on page 54).</p>\n<p>Choose a type of eidolon from the options starting on page 59 and other eidolons you have access to. When you choose your eidolon, you also determine its appearance and general form, within the parameters for that particular type of eidolon. Once you establish your eidolon's type and general appearance, these features can't be changed later, except by selecting special evolution feats that can cause your eidolon to develop new features.</p>\n<p>Your magical connection with your eidolon takes the form of a sigil on each of your bodies. As long as your eidolon is manifested, the sigil glows with light and can't be covered or disguised via any means; it will shine through clothing, appear over cloaks, and remain unaffected by obfuscating magic. This, combined with the way that the two of you clearly act in tandem, makes it readily apparent to an intelligent observer that the two of you are connected in some way, even if the person has never encountered a summoner before.</p>\n<p>You bring your eidolon into reality with the Manifest Eidolon action.</p>\n<p>Your eidolon is no mere minion. It doesn't have the minion or summoned trait, and the two of you work together and coordinate your actions. You and your eidolon share your actions and multiple attack penalty. Each round, you can use any of your actions (including reactions and free actions) for yourself or your eidolon.</p>\n<p>You coordinate your actions with your eidolon more efficiently when you Act Together. Your connection with your eidolon allows you to communicate with it telepathically at all times, even when it isn't manifested. You also gain the Share Senses action.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the connection between you and your eidolon means you both share a single pool of Hit Points. Damage taken by either you or the eidolon reduces your Hit Points, while healing either of you recovers your Hit Points. Like with your actions, if you and your eidolon are both subject to the same effect that affects your Hit Points, you apply those effects only once (applying the greater effect, if applicable). For instance, if you and your eidolon get caught in an area effect that would heal or damage you both, only the greater amount of healing or damage applies.</p>\n<h3>Gear and your Eidolon</h3>\n<p>Your eidolon can't wear or use magic items, except for items with the eidolon trait. An eidolon can have up to two items invested. Your eidolon's link to you means it can benefit from certain magic items invested by you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your eidolon gains item bonuses to Perception and skills from any magical items that you have invested.</li>\n<li>Your eidolon increases its item bonus to AC based on your armor's armor potency rune or bracers of armor. It also gains an item bonus to its saves from the resilient rune on your armor or from your bracers of armor. Other permanent items that grant or increase item bonuses to AC and saves might convey a similar benefit, as determined by the GM.</li>\n<li>Your eidolon's Strikes benefit from the fundamental and property runes on your handwraps of mighty blows. Alternatively, you can Invest a magic weapon (even though magic weapons can't normally be Invested) to share its fundamental and property runes with your eidolon. You share these benefits only while you're holding the weapon, and you can have no more than one weapon invested in this way at a time. In either case, the eidolon gains only the benefits that can apply to its attacks, with the same limitations noted in handwraps of mighty blows.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lost and Altered Actions</h3>\n<p>If you or your eidolon becomes slowed, stunned, quickened, or otherwise affected by something that changes the actions you gain at the start of each turn, it affects your shared actions. However, if you are both subject to such an effect, apply only the more severe one. For instance, if you or your eidolon were @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Slowed]{Slowed 1}, you would start your turn with one fewer action, but if you were both slowed 1, you would still lose only one action, rather than adding the two slowed effects together. However, if you were slowed 1 and your eidolon @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Slowed]{Slowed 2}, you'd have two fewer actions, because that's the more severe effect. If only one of you becomes restricted in how you can spend your actions, that restriction doesn't automatically extend to the other; for example, if your eidolon became @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Immobilized]{Immobilized} or petrified, it wouldn't be able to move, but you could still use your actions to move. The GM resolves any situation that's unclear.</p>\n<p>You, as the player, control both your summoner and your eidolon, and the two are generally considered to cooperate unless you decide for them not to. While a summoner's link with an eidolon is a partnership, ultimately the eidolon is linked to you, not the other way around. If there's ever a conflict of who should act, you win out over your eidolon. This means that if the eidolon comes under an effect that would take its actions out of your control, such as the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Confused]{Confused} or controlled condition, you can use all of your shared actions so your eidolon doesn't have any actions remaining to cause trouble (as long as you are able to act). However, if you came under such an effect, you would simply use all of your shared actions, preventing your eidolon from acting.</p>"
