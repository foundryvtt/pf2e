You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using primal spellcasting. You can't use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots. Unlike with other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Hierophant's Power]{Hierophant's Power} feat to gain a second slot.</p>"
