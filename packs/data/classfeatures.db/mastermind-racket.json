You might be a detective&nbsp;determined to solve crimes or a spymaster in the service&nbsp;of a powerful family or nation. If you operate outside the&nbsp;law, you might be an aspiring crime lord or information&nbsp;broker, excellent at directing others toward suitable jobs.</p>\n<p>If you successfully identify a creature using @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.KygTSeDvsFoSO6HW]{Recall Knowledge}, that creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} against your attacks until the start of your next turn; if you critically&nbsp;succeed, it’s flat-footed against your attacks for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>You’re trained in Society and one of the following skills&nbsp;of your choice: Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion.&nbsp;You can choose Intelligence as your key ability score.</p>",
