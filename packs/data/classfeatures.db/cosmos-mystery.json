Perhaps you see the glittering stars as a divine blessing, or perhaps you feel drawn to the infinitely dark spaces between. You might uphold deities like Desna, Sarenrae, or the deific lovers Shizuru and Tsukiyo who represent the sun and the moon-or you might draw power from dark entities from beyond the stars, like certain Outer Gods, or destructive gods of the night like Zon-Kuthon or the rat goddess Lao Shu Po.</p>\n<p><strong>Mystery Benefit</strong> Your body is as much an astronomical one as it is physical. You gain resistance equal to 2 + half your level against all physical damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Trained Skill</strong> Nature</p>\n<p><strong>Granted Cantrip</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Dancing Lights]{Dancing Lights}</p>\n<p><strong>Revelation Spells</strong> initial: @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Spray of Stars]{Spray of Stars}; advanced: @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Interstellar Void]{Interstellar Void}; greater: @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Moonlight Bridge]{Moonlight Bridge}</p>\n<p><strong>Related Domains</strong> darkness, moon</p>\n<h3>Curse of the Sky's Call</h3>\n<p>You have your head in the clouds-and not just figuratively. Your body is drawn toward the heavens, making you lighter and less substantial than you should be. Your eyes glow with starry light, and your hair and clothing float and drift around you.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Curse</strong> Your unnatural lightness makes it hard to keep your footing and interact with other physical objects. You are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled} 1 and take a -2 penalty to saves and DCs against @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Grapple]{Grapple}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Shove]{Shove}, and other forms of forced movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderate Curse</strong> Your body is drawn further skyward. You are Enfeebled 2, and the penalty from your minor curse increases to -3. You are treated as one size smaller for wind effects. You gain a +2 status bonus against @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Trip]{Trip} attempts, you only take half as much damage from falls, and you gain the effects of the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Powerful Leap]{Powerful Leap} and @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Quick Jump]{Quick Jump} skill feats. You weigh only half as much, and your Bulk, should someone need to carry you, is also half as much.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Curse (11th)</strong> As your body rises, you float just above the ground beneath you. You become enfeebled 4, and the penalty from your minor curse increases to -4. You can walk on liquids as if they were solid; you gain the effects of the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Cloud Jump]{Cloud Jump} skill feat; and you don't leave tracks, trigger weight-sensitive pressure plates, or otherwise connect with the ground below you.</p>"
