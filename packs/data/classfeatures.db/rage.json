You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall unconscious, whichever comes first. You can't voluntarily stop raging. While you are raging:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You deal 2 additional damage with melee weapons and unarmed attacks. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile.</li>\n<li>You take a -1 penalty to AC.</li>\n<li>You can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can Seek while raging.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and you can't Rage again for 1 minute.</p>"
