If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose a school in which to specialize. You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your school.</p>\n<p>If you don't choose a school, you're a universalist, a wizard who believes the path to true knowledge of magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater flexibility.</p>\n<p>As a necromancer, you call upon the powers of life and death. While your school is often vilified for its association with raising the undead, you understand that control over life also means control over healing. You add one 1st-level necromancy spell (such as <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Grim Tendrils]{Grim Tendrils}</em>) to your spellbook. You learn the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Call of the Grave]{Call of the Grave}</em> school spell.</p>"
