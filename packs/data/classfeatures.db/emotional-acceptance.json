Emotions unlock the door to your power-you might consider your heart the source of your strength, or you might find that the infinite complexity felt in a moment expresses your power more efficiently than any string of mystic words ever could. Your thought components are emotions. You might summon the sense of freedom to buoy you through the air or let fear grip your heart even as you plant it in another's mind. Emotion components tend to impart abstract or vivid effects to your visual and auditory spell manifestations as well as more intangible flashes of emotion, such as swirls of joyous color or a sense of growing melancholy.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Ability</strong> Your key ability score is Charisma</p>\n<p><strong>Psyche Action</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Restore the Mind]{Restore the Mind}</p>"
