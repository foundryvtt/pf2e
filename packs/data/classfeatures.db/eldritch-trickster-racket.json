            "value": "<p>As you started on the path of the rogue, you began to develop your own style to pursue your illicit activities. Your racket shapes your rogue techniques and the way you approach a job, while building your reputation in the criminal underworld for a certain type of work. A client with deep pockets might even hire a team of rogues for a particular heist, each specializing in a different racket, in order to cover all the bases.</p>\n<p>When it comes to a big heist, every rogue worth their salt knows that magic can throw meticulous plans into chaos, whether in the form of arcane wards or pesky divinations.</p>\n<p>You dabble in magic just enough to help handle these problems by jury-rigging spells and throwing a bit of your own magic into the mix. You might be a solitary thief, performing burglaries that can't be explained by skill alone, or a specialist called in by other rogues to deal with magical security measures. You might even be on the up-and-up, hired to test magical defenses or even build them yourself.</p>\n<p>Choose a multiclass archetype that has a basic, expert, and master spellcasting feat. You gain that archetype's dedication feat as a bonus feat even though you don't meet its level prerequisite, though you must meet its other prerequisites. For you, the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Magical Trickster]{Magical Trickster} rogue feat has a prerequisite of 2nd level instead of 4th level. You can choose the spellcasting ability score for the multiclass archetype you chose as your key ability score.</p>"
