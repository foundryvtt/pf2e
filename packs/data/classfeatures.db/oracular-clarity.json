You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using oracle spellcasting.</p>\n<p>You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.
