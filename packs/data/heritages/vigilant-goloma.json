You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Detect Magic]</em> cantrip as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. In addition, your awareness allows you to notice magical traps easier than others. Your proficiency rank in Perception is considered one step better when attempting to detect magical traps. (Trained is considered expert, expert is considered master, and master is considered legendary).</p>"
