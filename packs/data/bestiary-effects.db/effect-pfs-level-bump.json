Normally, when the Challenge Point total determines that the group's overall power is equivalent to the higher level in a Level Range (e.g. 2nd level in Level Range 1–2), the scenario's scaling will adjust for this.</p>\n<p>However, sometimes it is necessary to add a level bump, such as when the scenario's scaling is based on the number of players, or if the scenario lacks a low tier 16-18 scaling.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase the attack modifiers, attack damage, spell damage, saving throw modifiers, skill modifiers, Perception modifiers, and ACs by 1.</li>\n<li>Increase the Hit Point total by 10 or by 10%, whichever is higher.</li>\n</ul>"
