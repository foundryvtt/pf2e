Further damage dealt by the Lantern King's searing rune Strikes increases the status penalty by 1 on a failed save to a maximum status penalty of -4. This status penalty is reduced by one every time the affected creature achieves a critical success on a die roll against a creature that is at least equal to them in level, but otherwise is permanent until removed.</p>"
