He often adopts alternate shapes to play pranks, and even other Eldest are not immune to his mischievous scheming. Although he insists his pranks are intended only to incite levity and bring down imperious snobs, the chaos he creates in the name of good-natured fun is, to his targets, embarrassing at best and sometimes outright lethal. The Lantern King wanders the First World more than other Eldest, and he can be encountered in crowded markets and lonely byways alike. He is frequently accompanied by the Witchmarket, a traveling caravan of entertainers and merchants that serves as his court.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Play pranks, seek new jokes, leave lit lanterns in unusual places</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Be completely honest, ruin or explain a good joke</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> laughter, mischief, and transformation</p>\n<p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> CN, CE</p><h2>Devotee Benefits</h2><div><div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Intelligence or Charisma</div><div><strong>Divine Font</strong> harm or heal</div><div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Deception</div><div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> dagger</div><div><strong>Domains</strong> change, delirium, passion, trickery</div><div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: illusory disguise, 2nd: hideous laughter, 6th: baleful polymorph</div></div>",
