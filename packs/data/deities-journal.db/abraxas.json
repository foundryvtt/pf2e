Abraxas has an encyclopedic knowledge of magical formulas and destructive secrets, favoring those that inflict suffering and destruction. His Final Incantation is a word of power that can unravel the mightiest of spells and unmake even artifacts. He takes the form of a viper-legged humanoid with a fanged, deformed bird's head. Abraxas's cults are most prevalent among the drow of Golarion, but small circles devoted to him can be found in most major cities on the surface as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Learn and hoard forbidden magic, steal secrets from others</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Destroy forbidden lore, reveal the entirety of a secret</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> forbidden lore, magic, and snakes</p>\n<p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NE, CE</p><h2>Devotee Benefits</h2><div><div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Intelligence or Wisdom</div><div><strong>Divine Font</strong> harm</div><div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Society</div><div><strong>Favored</strong> <strong>Weapon</strong> crossbow</div><div><strong>Domains</strong> cities, earth, travel, wealth</div><div><strong>Alternate Domains</strong> duty</div><div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: illusory object, 4th: creation, 7th: magnificent mansion</div></div>",
