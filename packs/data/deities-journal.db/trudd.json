Despite his relatively young age, Trudd is the strongest deity in the dwarven pantheon, and as a result is often left to guard his father's halls while Torag is absent. For a dwarf, Trudd sports a remarkably short beard, spawning many tales, including one that he sold it for some unknown boon.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Offer your strength to aid others, protect those weaker than you</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Engage in petty showcases of strength, use your strength to take advantage of others</p>\n<p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, NG</p><h2>Devotee Benefits</h2><div><div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Strength or Constitution</div><div><strong>Divine Font</strong> heal</div><div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Athletics</div><div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> warhammer</div><div><strong>Domains</strong> confidence, duty, might, protection</div><div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: endure, 3rd: haste, 4th: stoneskin</div></div>",
