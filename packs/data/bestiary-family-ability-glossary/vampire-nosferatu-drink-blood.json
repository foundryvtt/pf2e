            "value": "<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The nosferatu's last action was a successful fangs Strike</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The nosferatu sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood. This requires an @Check[type:athletics] check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 1}, and the nosferatu regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the nosferatu, but increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A nosferatu can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no HP from doing so.</p>\n<p>The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful @Check[type:medicine|dc:20] check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.</p>"
