These checks can only be attempted by creatures adjacent to the section, and each attempt takes 2 actions. An extinguished fire still emits concealing smoke for 1 additional round but is no longer hot enough to deal damage. A @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Dispel Magic]{Dispel Magic} spell or a spell with the water trait (2nd level; counteract DC 15) extinguishes a section of flames. If the PCs disable three of the five sections of the flames of Verakivhan, the hazard is too weakened to sustain itself, and the remaining flames disappear. If there are no demons or elementals remaining in the area, the hazard is automatically disabled.</p>",
