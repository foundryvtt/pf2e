It also ignores any golem antimagic the target might have. The effect's duration endsif the baton is destroyed or leaves your possession for at least 1 minute, and you can issue commands to the target only while holding the baton.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact;</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You closely direct the actions of one construct you control and can see within 60 feet.
