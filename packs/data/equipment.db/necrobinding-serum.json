            "value": "<p>Activate <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> Interact This potent necromantic serum is distilled from the body of an intelligent corporeal undead who seeks to establish absolute control over their undead minions. The raw materials of a <em>necrobinding serum</em> are composed of a slurry made from the creator's own flesh and blood mixed with pulped fungal toxins. The exact ingredients vary, but the act of brewing a necrobinding serum is typically viewed with distaste at best and, in many societies, is regarded as an evil act. While <em>necrobinding serum</em> isn't a poison, its method of delivery is identical to that of an injury poison-it's applied to a weapon that's then used to Strike an undead target (living creatures suffer no additional effect from exposure to a dose of necrobinding serum). When an undead creature is targeted by a dose of necrobinding serum, it must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:19] save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The undead creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The undead creature is momentarily disoriented; it takes a -1 status penalty to all attack rolls made against you until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The undead creature becomes friendly toward you.
