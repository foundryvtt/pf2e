A <em>cursed dreamstone</em> seems to function as a normal <em>dreamstone</em> until the bearer falls asleep or is forced to attempt a saving throw against a sleep effect. At this point, the person carrying the cursed <em>dreamstone</em> must attempt a DC 26 Will save to resist the curse's effects.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Critical Success</strong> The character resists the curse entirely and experiences a vivid dream while sleeping that warns them of the nature of the <em>cursed dreamstone</em>.<br /><strong>Success</strong> The character resists the curse.<br /><strong>Failure</strong> As long as the cursed character possesses the stone, they are fatigued whenever they wake from sleep, whether natural or magically induced, and they take a -2 item penalty to all saving throws against sleep effects instead of gaining the normal bonus from a <em>dreamstone</em>.<br /><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, and whenever the bearer attempts a saving throw against a sleep effect, they get the outcome that is one degree worse than the result of their saving throw.</span></p>"
