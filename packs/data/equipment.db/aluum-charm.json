An <em>aluum charm</em> grants control over a particular aluum and lesser influence over other such constructs. As long as you wear an aluum's linked <em>aluum charm</em>, that aluum follows your verbal commands, including somewhat nuanced orders like \"subdue this target\" or \"strike anyone wearing a blue robe.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">D</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The charm grants you control over an aluum you can see within 60 feet, with a level equal to or lower than the charm. This has the effect of <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Dominate]{Dominate}</em> and allows a @Check[type:will|dc:28] save. If the aluum is currently under the control of someone wearing its linked charm, it gets a result on its saving throw one degree higher than what it rolled.</p>\n<p>You can control only one aluum at a time using this activation, and controlling a new aluum ends the effect for one you had previously affected.</p>"
