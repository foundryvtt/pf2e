The ring grants you a +1 item bonus to all Crafting checks to construct or repair clockworks.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> (varies) Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>winder's ring</em> extends a winding key that fits any clockwork contraption or creature, allowing you to fully wind a clockwork device or creature in half the usual time. When you activate a <em>winder's ring</em> in this way, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:16]. On a failure, the <em>winder's ring</em> exhausts itself, and you can't activate it again until the next time you make your daily preparations.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>winder's ring</em> transforms into a @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-3.Clockwork Spy]{Clockwork Spy} that doesn't require winding and obeys your spoken commands for up to 1 hour. In this form, the <em>winder's ring</em> has the minion trait. You can use this action again to return the clockwork spy to <em>winder's ring</em> form as long as you're adjacent to the clockwork spy. If the clockwork spy is slain, it reverts to its ring shape, and the <em>winder's ring</em> can't be activated again until 1 week has passed.</p>"
