The copy follows your specific instructions and performs a single, straightforward task for up to 30 minutes. It takes the copy three times as long to complete the task as it would you, meaning it can perform a task that would take you a maximum of 10 minutes. It doesn't react quickly enough to be of any use during an encounter, and it can't use your spells or other special abilities-just basic actions and skill actions.</p>\n<p>The copy disappears and returns to the hat as a piece of cloth when the given task has been completed, or when you Dismiss the activation.</p>"
