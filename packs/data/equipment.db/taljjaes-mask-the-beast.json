Each of Taljjae's masks is an 18th-level unique item with the invested and magical traits; if broken, they're automatically repaired to full HP when invested during daily preparations. The effect of a mask on a PC is noted in the mask's Understudy entry. Wearing one of Taljjae's masks also imposes Taljjae's jelly sense and jelly gluttony on the creature as long as it wears the mask.</p>\n<p>The Beast brings out its wearer's feral nature, granting it a claw melee unarmed attack that deals 1d4 slashing damage and has the agile trait, or increasing the damage die of their claw unarmed attack from 1d4 to 1d6 damage if they have a claw unarmed attack that deals 1d4 damage.</p>"
