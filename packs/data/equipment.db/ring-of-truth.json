When you invest the ring, you are rendered unable to tell a deliberate lie, in either speech or writing. If you attempt to omit the truth or phrase things truthfully but deceptively, roll a @Check[type:flat|dc:11]; on a failure, the ring itself blurts out the entire truth (as you believe it) as an answer. Keeping silent does not activate the ring's curse. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the ring fuses to you.</p>"
