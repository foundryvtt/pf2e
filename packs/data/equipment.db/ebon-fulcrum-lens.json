            "value": "<p>This strangest and most powerful of the fulcrum lenses resembles a chip of smooth obsidian containing three dark glimmers of <em>Nhimbaloth’s</em> essence. Incorporeal creatures can touch and hold the Ebon Fulcrum Lens. While you have the Ebon Fulcrum Lens invested, and you’re a corporeal creature, you become insubstantial, gain the incorporeal trait, and are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Drained]{Drained 2}. Your drained condition can’t be reduced below 2 as long as you have the lens invested. You can activate the lens in the following ways. Both require expenditures of glimmers within the lens; once the lens is depleted of its three glimmers, it retains its ability to make corporeal creatures insubstantial but can’t be used for its other abilities until its glimmers are restored (which generally requires a ritual or being steeped in an area of <em>Nhimbaloth’s</em> power).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">R</span> envision;</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day;</p>\n<p><strong>Requirement</strong> At least one glimmer remains in the Ebon Fulcrum Lens;</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> you have the rejuvenation ability;</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> you would be destroyed and are able to rejuvenate;</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> For the first 24 hours after you rejuvenate, you gain a +1 item bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and DCs.
