An envisioning mask covers your entire face, though it doesn't hinder your vision or other senses.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You lose the ability to produce language and instead communicate wordlessly through a series of psychic projections. This acts as <em>telepathy </em>with a range of 100 feet, but it is understandable to all creatures regardless of whether they have a language. When communicating with non-aeons, however, your meaning is often vague and mysterious. This effect lasts for 10 minutes.</p>"
