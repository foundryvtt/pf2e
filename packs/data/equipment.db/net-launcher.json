A net launcher can be wielded while propped up on your shoulder or cradled under your arm. A net must be carefully folded to be launched without tangling. Properly loading a net into a net launcher takes 1 minute. A net fired with a net launcher can target a Medium or smaller creature within 40 feet, rather than 20 feet.</p>"
