When light from the lantern passes through the lens, it alters the light to make it easier to perform a common exploration activity with the lantern.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, an <em>exploration lens</em> can be installed in a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Wayfinder]{Wayfinder} like an aeon stone. In this case, light (such as that from a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Lantern (Hooded)]{Lantern (Hooded)}, @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Torch]{Torch}, or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Light]{Light}</em> spell) must still pass through the lens and you must hold the wayfinder in your hand for it to function.</p>\n<p>There are several different types of <em>exploration lens</em>, each granting benefits with a different type of exploration activity. Each type of lens is distinguishable from all the other types by holding it up to a bright light.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Type: Searching</strong></p>\n<p>This lens has an opalescent sheen when held up to light.</p>\n<p>The lens subtly outlines hidden doors and concealed hazards, granting you a +2 item bonus to Perception checks to spot such features while @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Search]{Searching}.</p>\n<p>Even if you aren't Searching, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to Search.</p>"
