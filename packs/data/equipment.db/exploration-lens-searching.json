When light from the lantern passes through the lens, it alters the light to make it easier to perform a common exploration activity with the lantern. You can find more information about exploration activities related to these lenses on page 496 of the Core Rulebook.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, an exploration lens can be installed in a wayfinder like an aeon stone. In this case, light (such as that from a lantern, torch, or light spell) must still pass through the lens and you must hold the wayfinder in your hand for it to function.</p>\n<p>There are several different types of exploration lens, each granting benefits with a different type of exploration activity. Each type of lens is distinguishable from all the other types by holding it up to a bright light.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Type: Searching</strong></p>\n<p>This lens has an opalescent sheen when held up to light.</p>\n<p>The lens subtly outlines hidden doors and concealed hazards, granting you a +2 item bonus to Perception checks to spot such features while Searching.</p>\n<p>Even if you aren’t Searching, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to Search.</p>"
