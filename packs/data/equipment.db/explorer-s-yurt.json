Fires and light inside the yurt do not extend illumination into the area surrounding the yurt, making it harder to spot from a distance.</p>\n<p>A large loop of red cloth hangs from one wall. If this loop is pulled, which takes an Interact action, the entire yurt immediately folds back up into its deactivated form, ready for further travel.</p>"
