The snare is patently obvious unless planted amid tall reeds or grasses or in someplace dark. Medium and smaller creatures can pass among the stakes easily; unlike most snares, the hoof stakes snare triggers only when a Large or larger creature enters its square. The snare deals [[/r 2d6[piercing]]] damage to the triggering creature, which must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:18] save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half damage, and it takes a -5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed for 1 minute, or until the creature or an ally spends three Interact actions to carefully remove the stakes.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The triggering creature takes full damage. The creature takes a -5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed, and any time it deals damage with a foot Strike (including as part of Trample or a similar ability), the creature takes [[/r 2d6[piercing]]] damage. The effect lasts for 1 minute, or until the creature or an ally spends three Interact actions to carefully remove the stakes.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the circumstance penalty to its Speed is -10 feet, and the creature takes [[/r 4d6[piercing]]] damage whenever it deals damage with a foot Strike.</p>"
