            "value": "<p>Hendrid Pratchett himself designed this custom skull-topped +1 striking exquisite sword cane and had it gilded in high-quality gold. Its first victim was the very smith whom Pratchett commissioned to craft the weapon, so the means of its construction are a secret known only to Pratchett. The magic of the <em>Reaper's Lancet</em> applies to both the blade and the sheath, making them each effectively a +1 striking weapon, but only if both are wielded by the same creature-if the two components are shared between creatures, only the blade retains the rune's magic.</p>\n<p><em>Reaper's Lancet </em>has a hidden reservoir inside the skull that automatically applies a new dose of poison to the blade after the previous dose was expended with a successful Strike. The reservoir must be filled manually (a process requiring 1 minute) and is large enough to hold only 3 doses at a time. Any sort of injury-delivered poison can be placed in it, though all doses must be of the same poison. The Price of the poison is not reflected in this weapon's listed Price.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">R</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You damage a creature with Reaper's Lancet</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You poison the creature you hit with the poison currently in the reservoir.</p>"
