Activating a feather token causes it to transform into another object, which then can be used as normal for that object. Each feather can be activated only once, with most of them permanently becoming the item in their description.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">A</span> Interact</p>\n<p>When activated, this token transforms into a small sparrow that waits on your finger for you to relay a message up to 1 minute in length, along with the name and rough location of a recipient. The recipient must be someone you have met, and the location must be somewhere you have visited. After receiving the message, the bird flies off to deliver it, traveling at 30 miles per hour and then searching for the target in the location you provided. If the bird finds the target, it moves adjacent to them, your words emanate from the bird, and the bird then flies off and vanishes. The bird also vanishes if it fails to find your target after 10 hours of searching the location you specified.</p>"
