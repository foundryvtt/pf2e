            "value": "<p>It's said that the pale blue light of this eldritch lantern shines from another dimension or even is linked, somehow, to the glow of a ghost when it is consumed by the Outer Goddess Nhimbaloth. A lantern of empty light is not intrinsically an evil item, though it remains a favored tool of those who would manipulate the minds of others for sinister reasons. It can be used as a normal bull's-eye lantern, but prolonged use tends to instill in the user a vague sense of being watched by unseen eyes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> Interact (emotion, visual)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You direct the lantern's light upon a single living creature within 60 feet.
