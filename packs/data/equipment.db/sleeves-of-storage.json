These spaces each function as a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Bag of Holding (Type I)]{Bag of Holding} that can hold up to 5 Bulk of items (for a total of 10 Bulk), though no individual item can be of more than 1 Bulk; the sleeves grow slightly heavy as you reach maximum capacity. You can add or remove an item from a sleeve with a single hand free as an Interact action.</p>\n<p>If a sleeve is completely empty, you can place your own familiar into that extradimensional space. It can survive comfortably in your sleeve for up to 1 hour, after which it begins to <em>suffocate</em>. While in your sleeve, it can't be affected or targeted by any effects, but you don't benefit from any master abilities. A familiar can exit the sleeve of its own volition with a single action that has the <em>manipulate </em>and <em>move</em> traits. You can't place any other creature into your sleeves, nor can you place your familiar in a sleeve if it's larger than Tiny. If your familiar is in your sleeve, you can't place any items in the sleeve.</p>"
