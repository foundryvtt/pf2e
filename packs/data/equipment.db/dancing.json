The weapon can't move through an enemy's space. The weapon can't use reactions, and its Fly actions don't trigger reactions.</p>\n<p>While it's activated, a <em>dancing</em> weapon makes Strikes with an attack modifier of [[/r 1d20+24]] plus its item bonus to attack rolls. It uses the weapon's normal damage but has a +0 Strength modifier. The weapon's abilities that automatically trigger on a hit or critical hit still function, but the weapon can't be activated or benefit from any of your abilities while dancing.</p>\n<p>Each round, when the weapon is finished using its actions, attempt a DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the activation ends and the weapon falls to the ground. You can't activate the item again for 10 minutes.</p>"
