It can be loaded with up to 4 Bulk of items. Most creatures aren't small enough to fit on the cart, and even for Tiny creatures, it makes for a choppy ride; while riding the cart, a creature gains two actions at the start of each of its turns, instead of three. Once activated, the cart moves forward at a speed of 30 feet per round on your turn for up to 1 minute. If it strikes an obstruction, it attempts to continue its movement, pushing with an Athletics bonus of +5, once per round. The wind-up cart has AC 15, Hardness 2, 24 Hit Points, and a Break Threshold of 12. After its 1-minute duration completes, the cart collapses back into scrap.</p>"
