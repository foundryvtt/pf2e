Consulting the thesis grants a +2 item bonus to Warfare Lore checks. Like most scholarly compendiums, this usage requires holding the thesis in one hand.</p>\n<p>The thesis also serves as an extradimensional armory for weapons and ammunition. The thesis has a capacity of 5 Bulk, and only weapons and ammunition can be stored within it. You and others can Interact with the thesis to store or retrieve a weapon or piece of ammunition in it, like a mundane container.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The thousand-blade thesis dramatically unfurls, and the weapons contained within it spring forth and array themselves impressively in the air, floating within easy reach. For 1 minute, you can use a free action to Interact to draw one of the floating weapons. Others can attempt to nab them out of the air, but to do so they must critically succeed at a Disarm check. You can't place weapons back into the thesis until the minute elapses.</p>"
