            "value": "<p>In an effort to spread the knowledge of magic as widely as possible, worshippers of Nethys discovered a way to bind cantrips into cards accessible even to non-spellcasters. The deck contains thick parchment cards, each roughly half the size of a playing card. In precise, no-nonsense script, each card simply states the name of its cantrip, color-coded based on its school.</p>\n<p>This pack contains 5 cards of a single common cantrip.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> or more (envision, Interact)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You envision your desired cantrip, causing its card to rise to the top of the deck, and draw the card. The deck casts that cantrip as a 1st-level spell, with a DC of 15 and a spell attack modifier of +5. The card crumbles into dust as the cantrip takes effect. The activation takes the same number of actions as the cantrip you chose takes to cast.</p>"
