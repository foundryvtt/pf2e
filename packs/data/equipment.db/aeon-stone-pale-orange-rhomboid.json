You can benefit from the effects of only one pale orange rhomboid aeon stone in a given day.</p>\n<p>The resonant power allows you to wait more than an hour to return to your body with the aeon stone; as long as the wayfinder remains on the body, your body doesn't decay and you can return at any point.</p>"
