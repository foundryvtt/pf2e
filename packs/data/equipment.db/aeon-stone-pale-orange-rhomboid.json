At any time within the next hour after your body died, you can spend 1 minute concentrating in order to return to your body.</p>\n<p>As long as your body is still intact, you are no longer dead- you are restored to 1 HP with the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Doomed]{Doomed 3} and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Wounded]{Wounded 3} conditions. You can benefit from the effects of only one pale orange rhomboid aeon stone in a given day.</p>\n<p>The resonant power allows you to wait more than an hour to return to your body with the aeon stone; as long as the wayfinder remains on the body, your body doesn't decay and you can return at any point.</p>"
