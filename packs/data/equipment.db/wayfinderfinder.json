            "value": "<p>This extremely fetching oversized compass has numerous extraneous gears, levers, doodads, and buttons. It does not function as a compass. Instead, it always points to the nearest wayfinder. An indentation in the middle of the wayfinderfinder can hold a single wayfinder. A wayfinder stored in this manner-and any aeon stone it may contain-provides no benefits, but the wayfinderfinder points to the nearest wayfinder of the type stored within, instead of any wayfinder. If you have more than one wayfinderfinder holding a wayfinder on your person at a given time, the wayfinderfinders point to each other instead, and any aeon stones in your possession begin annoyingly bouncing off your head instead of rotating around it.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> command</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The wayfinderfinder shouts \"Explore! Report! Cooperate!\" then rapidly explains that certain uses of the wayfinderfinder may void its warranty.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: This item originates from the 2022 Paizo April Fools Blog post.</em></p>"
