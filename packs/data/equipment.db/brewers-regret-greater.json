The thick, salty sourness ruins the taste of most other food, but it also creates a strong desire to live to taste anything else. For 1 hour after consumption, you gain a +3 item bonus to saves against death and negative effects. In addition, your doomed value decreases by 1 (minimum 0). You can reduce the doomed condition with brewer's regret only once per day, and after you do, you can't reduce the doomed condition from the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Restoration]{Restoration}</em> spell that same day (or vice versa).</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Effect: Brewer's Regret (Greater)]{Effect: Brewer's Regret (Greater)}</p>"
