This potent combination singes the nostrils and throat, removing effects that make you sluggish. When you consume the pudding, it attempts a counteract check with a [[/r {1d20+31}#Counteract Check]]{+31} counteract modifier to remove the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Slowed]{Slowed} condition from a single source, using the source of that condition to determine the counteract level and DC. You also become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Quickened]{Quickened} for 2 rounds. While taking the additional action from being quickened, you scream, as a result of both the flavor and the mandrake paste's properties. You can use the additional action to Step, Stride, Strike, or Demoralize. If you choose to Demoralize, you gain a +4 item bonus to the Intimidation check.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Effect: Dragon's Blood Pudding (Major)]{Effect: Dragon's Blood Pudding (Major)}</p>"
