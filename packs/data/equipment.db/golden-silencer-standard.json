They silence both the loud gunshot and the screams of creatures wounded by its shot. A weapon with a golden silencer attached emits no light and makes no noise when fired. A target hit by a ranged Strike from the affixed weapon must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:20] save or be silenced as well until the start of its next turn. A silenced creature can't call for help or use sonic abilities, nor can it use abilities with the auditory trait. This prevents it from casting spells that include verbal components.</p>"
