No two society's patterns are the same, and purchasers tend to return to the same weaver each time to ensure new cords match previous ones. In a room lit only by dim candlelight, the reflective metal threads shimmer in a specific pattern. Many societies use these cords to prevent outsiders from infiltrating secret meetings and often have someone at the meeting area's entrance checking cords before allowing entry.</p>"
