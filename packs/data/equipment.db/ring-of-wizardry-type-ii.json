            "value": "<p>This ring is made from the purest platinum and is covered in esoteric arcane symbols. It does nothing unless you have a spellcasting class feature with the arcane tradition. While wearing the ring of wizardry, you gain a +2 item bonus to Arcana checks and have two additional 2nd-level and one additional 1st-level arcane spell slot each day. You prepare spells in these slots or cast from them spontaneously, just as you normally cast your spells.</p>\n<p>If you take off the ring for any reason, you lose the additional spell slots. You can't gain spell slots from more than one ring of wizardry per day, nor can a single ring of wizardry grant spell slots more than once per day.</p>\n<p>If you can cast arcane spells in a variety of different ways (such as if you are a draconic bloodline sorcerer with the wizard multiclass archetype), you can divide the spell slots as you wish among your various sources of arcane spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> You have a spellcasting class feature with the arcane tradition.</p>"
