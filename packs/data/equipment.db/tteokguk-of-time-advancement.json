While normal tteokguk helps you gain an extra year of age when you eat it, the magic in tteokguk of time advancement takes this a step further.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Upon eating the tteokguk, you gain several years of age, morphing into an older version of yourself. Your physical appearance and personality change to those you would have at any age older than your current one. This grants you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to pass as the chosen age, and you can add your level as a proficiency bonus to these checks even if you're untrained. Furthermore, unless a creature specifically uses a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} action or otherwise carefully examines you, it doesn't get a chance to notice that you aren't at your true age. This lasts until morning of the next day, at which point you are temporarily immune until the next lunar new year.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Effect: Tteokguk of Time Advancement]{Effect: Tteokguk of Time Advancement}</p>"
