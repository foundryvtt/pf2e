            "value": "<p>A <em>dreamstone</em> is a disc-shaped object carved with imagery or words sacred to Desna-be it her religious symbol, a short prayer, or merely the shape of a single star. When you carry a <em>dreamstone</em>, you find it easier to fall asleep, and you gain improved effects from the resulting rest. You always fall asleep within 5 minutes of lying down with the intention of sleeping, and you require only 2 hours of sleep per day to gain the benefits of 8 hours of sleep, provided you have carried the <em>dreamstone</em> for at least 24 hours prior to resting. As long as you carry a <em>dreamstone</em>, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against sleep effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">A</span> Interact (metamagic)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell of 4th level or lower that has the sleep trait or is associated with dreams, the spell slot is not expended.</p>"
