The ring doesn't change your appearance beyond concealing weapons and armor. As soon as you wield a weapon, the weapon becomes obvious to onlookers and is no longer affected by the ring until you sheathe the weapon for at least 1 minute. A creature can disbelieve this illusion by Seeking or any time it hits you with an attack.</p>"
