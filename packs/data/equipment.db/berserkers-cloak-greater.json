When worn, the cloak drapes over your head and around your shoulders, imbuing you with a bear's ferocity.</p>\n<p>If you have the Rage action, while raging you grow jaws that deal 1d10 piercing damage and claws that deal 1d6 slashing damage and have the agile trait. This transformation is a morph effect, and both the jaws and claws are unarmed attacks in the brawling weapon group. You gain the benefits of a <em>+2 weapon potency</em> rune and a greater <em>striking</em> rune with these attacks (gaining a +2 item bonus to attack rolls and increasing the weapon damage dice by two).</p>\n<p>If you have an animal instinct and the bestial rage instinct ability, instead of gaining these unarmed attacks, your unarmed attacks from the bestial rage instinct ability gain the benefits of a <em>+3 weapon potency</em> rune and a <em>greater striking</em> rune (granting a +3 item bonus to attack rolls and increasing the weapon damage dice by three).</p>\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> You are a barbarian with the animal instinct.</p>"
