There are only a limited number of elder signs, and each time one is destroyed, the universe's doom creeps inexorably closer. Reciting one of three different occult mantras (DC 20 Occultism check to do so correctly) allows three different activations. All three abilities work only on a creature connected to the Elder Mythos or a cosmic horror, such as a wendigo or gug; the activations refer to them as \"eldritch creatures.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">D</span> command, envision, Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>elder sign</em> casts a 10th-level banishment spell on an eldritch creature. Even if the creature isn't extraplanar, the <em>elder sign</em> can still banish it, sending it back to the part of the Material Plane from which it originated. If the creature is a Great Old One, the <em>elder sign</em> banishes it automatically (as if it critically failed its save) but is then forever destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">D</span> command, envision, Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>elder sign</em> casts dispel magic on an effect from an eldritch creature, using a counteract level of 10 and +30 modifier for the roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">D</span> command, envision, Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>elder sign</em> casts dimensional lock, though it wards against travel by only eldritch creatures. Each time the <em>elder sign</em> casts <em>dimensional lock</em> in this way, the previous <em>dimensional lock</em> spell ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> The only way to destroy an <em>elder sign</em> is to use it to banish a Great Old One.</p>"
