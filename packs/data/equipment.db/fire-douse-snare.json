When a creature enters the square, the vessel's neck shatters, dispersing the powders into the air. The powder instantly douses non-magical fires the size of a campfire or smaller within 10 feet of the snare. The creature triggering the snare must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:20] save to avoid getting powder in its face. A creature @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Blinded]{Blinded} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Dazzled]{Dazzled} by the powder can use an Interact action to attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:10|showDC:owner] check; on a success, it removes the condition. On a failure, it can try again, with a @Check[type:flat|dc:5|showDC:owner] check on the next Interact check. If it fails a second time, it automatically removes the condition with a third Interact action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is dazzled for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is blinded until the end of its next turn and dazzled for 1 minute afterwards.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is blinded for 1 minute and dazzled for 10 minutes afterwards.</p>"
