Its space becomes Large, it gains the weaknesses and resistances of a @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Spider Swarm]{Spider Swarm}, and the swarm trait, though it doesn't gain swarm mind, as it's controlled by a single mind. Its unarmed attacks are replaced with a single-action swarming attack that deals 1d8 damage of the type normally inflicted by the companion's unarmed attacks to any foe in its space, with a @Check[type:reflex|dc:23|basic:true|name:Swarm Attack|showDC:all] save. While in swarm form, your companion can take the Support action but can't perform its advanced maneuver. Its other statistics don't change. If the companion is reduced to 0 Hit Points while in swarm form, the companion immediately recombines into its original form in an available space, in addition to the usual effects of being reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p>"
