All creatures within 10 feet of you when you started the Stride must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:24|traits:emotion,mental,visual] save. On a failure, a creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Fascinated]{Fascinated} and must spend at least one of its actions on its next turn to move toward you. A fascinated creature can attempt another Will save if you move more than 30 feet away from them, and as normal, acting hostile to a creature or its allies breaks fascination automatically. Creatures that critically failed their save don't receive further saves if you move more than 30 feet away, and acting hostile to such a creature's allies allows them to attempt another save, rather than automatically ending the fascination. You can Sustain the Activation for up to 1 minute.</p>"
