Applying <em>anointing oil</em> to a corpse casts a 5th-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Gentle Repose]{Gentle Repose}</em> on it. The effects last for 24 hours. The funerary rites of the Knights of Lastwall sometimes include using this type of oil on their dead if they are to be buried.</p>\n<p>The oil is repugnant to the undead. An undead creature that touches a corpse treated with this oil is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} until the contact is broken or the oil's effect wears off.</p>"
