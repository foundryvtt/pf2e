            "value": "<p>This life-sized, hollow, golden goose statuette has an open, fanged mouth and an unsettling aura of hunger. Fiends sometimes present it as a gift to mortals whose greed makes them susceptible to temptation. While the <em>golden goose</em> can be used without malice, those who possess such a thing often find its glittering lure erodes their morals over time.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You feed the goose the warm, still-bloody heart of any sapient, non-evil creature who died within the past hour. The <em>golden goose</em>'s eyes flare red as it chews the heart into pulp. Once the heart is destroyed, the goose lays a golden egg worth 50 gp, or 100 gp if you murdered the creature for no reason other than to feed the goose.</p>\n<p>After 12 such eggs are laid, the next time you activate the <em>golden goose</em>, it transmutes your heart to gold. This effect functions as <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Flesh to Stone]{Flesh to Stone}</em>, with a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:30] save to resist. If you become petrified, you turn to solid, transparent stone. Your heart becomes a golden egg worth 100 gp, which can be retrieved only by shattering your body. Whether or not you turn to stone, the <em>golden goose</em> dissipates with a honk into sulfurous smoke.</p>"
