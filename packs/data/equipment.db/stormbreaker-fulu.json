When you activate the fulu, it vanishes in a wisp of cloud, and you gain resistance 15 to cold, electricity, and sonic damage until the end of your next turn. For that duration, you ignore difficult terrain from wind and weather, and you can't be forcibly moved or teleported unless the effect counteracts the fulu (DC 40). These protections apply against the triggering effect.</p>"
