As long as the <em>anchor spear</em> remains embedded in the creature, any time the creature burrows or climbs, it treats normal terrain as difficult terrain and difficult terrain as greater difficult terrain. The creature can spend an Interact action to attempt a @Check[type:athletics|dc:32|name:Remove Spearhead] check to remove the spearhead.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The <em>anchor spear</em> is removed, becomes broken, and falls to the ground in the creature's space.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The <em>anchor spear</em> is removed, the creature takes [[/r 1d8[piercing]]] damage, and the spear falls to the ground in a random space adjacent to the creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The <em>anchor spear</em> remains in place, and the creature takes [[/r 1d8[piercing]]] damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the creature takes [[/r 2d8[piercing]]] damage.</p>"
