Any animal or vegetable matter put in the bag has a chance of triggering the bag's interest. Whenever you reach into the bag to retrieve an item or place an animal or plant or animal or plant product) within the bag, roll a DC 9 flat check. On a success, the bag ignores the intrusion. On a failure, the bag devours the triggering material, removing it from this realm of existence; the bag can't eat artifacts or other similarly hard-to-destroy items. If the triggering material is not entirely inside of the bag, such as when someone reaches a hand inside, the bag of devouring attempts to pull it completely inside the bag using a Grapple action, with an Athletics bonus determined by the type of bag. On a success, it devours the victim or object entirely.</p>\n<p><strong>Athletics Bonus</strong> +15; acts as a <em>type II bag of holding </em></p>"
