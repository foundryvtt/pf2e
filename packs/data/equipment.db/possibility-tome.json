If you open the book before it's been activated, its vellum pages are blank and pristine, but once activated, words dance and swim onto the pages before your eyes.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 10 minutes (envision, Interact)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> As you flip through the book, you think about a broad topic you want to know more about.</p>\n<p>Choose one skill: Arcana, Crafting, Medicine, Nature, Occultism, Religion, Society, or a single subcategory of Lore. The book's pages fill with information about that skill, though only you can see the information.</p>\n<p>While the pages are full, you can spend an Interact action perusing the book just before attempting a check to Recall Knowledge with the chosen skill. This grants you a +3 item bonus to the check, and if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.</p>\n<p>The information within the book disappears after 24 hours or when the tome is activated again.</p>"
