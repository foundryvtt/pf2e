Choose one skill: Arcana, Crafting, Medicine, Nature, Occultism, Religion, Society, or a single subcategory of Lore. The book’s pages fill with information about that skill, though only you can see the information. While the pages are full, you can spend an Interact action perusing the book just before attempting a check to Recall Knowledge with the chosen skill. This grants you a +3 item bonus to the check, and if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. The information within the book disappears after 24 hours or when the tome is activated again.</span></p>"
