Closer inspection reveals the gourd has grown in the rough shape of a hut or similar small dwelling.<br></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Activate</strong> (1 minute) Interact; <strong>Effect</strong> You place the <em>gourd home</em> on the ground (in an open area large enough to contain it) and cause it to expand in size to a 30-foot-square structure with one door. The interior of the gourd is a single large room that can hold 10 Small or Medium creatures with moderate comfort.<br></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Activate</strong> <span style=\"font-family: 'Pathfinder2eActions'; font-size: 1.8em; display: inline;\">A</span> Interact; <strong>Frequency</strong> once per day; <strong>Requirements</strong> The gourd home must be expanded into its house form atop earth or soil.; <strong>Effect</strong> By rapping on the door from either outside or inside, you cause the <em>gourd home</em> to shrink back into its normal size and appear to be a non-magical gourd sitting on the ground. For the following 8 hours, the interior of the gourd home becomes an extradimensional space whose size appears unchanged to those within.<br></span></p>\n<p><span>If anyone outside picks up or damages the gourd, or if anyone inside the <em>gourd home</em> attempts to exit, all creatures within the <em>gourd home</em> immediately reappear in the area surrounding the gourd, and the <em>gourd home</em> becomes inactive for 24 hours.</span></p>",
