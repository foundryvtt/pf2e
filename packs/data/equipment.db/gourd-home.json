The interior of the gourd is a single large room that can hold 10 Small or Medium creatures with moderate comfort.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">A</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The gourd home must be expanded into its house form atop earth or soil.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> By rapping on the door from either outside or inside, you cause the <em>gourd home</em> to shrink back into its normal size and appear to be a non-magical gourd sitting on the ground. For the following 8 hours, the interior of the gourd home becomes an extradimensional space whose size appears unchanged to those within.</p>\n<p>If anyone outside picks up or damages the gourd, or if anyone inside the <em>gourd home</em> attempts to exit, all creatures within the <em>gourd home</em> immediately reappear in the area surrounding the gourd, and the <em>gourd home</em> becomes inactive for 24 hours.</p>"
