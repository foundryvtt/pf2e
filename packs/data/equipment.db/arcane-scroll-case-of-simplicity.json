On the inside, intricate runic diagrams spiral out to surround the scroll stored within.

You must be able to cast spells of a given tradition to use a <em>scroll case of simplicity</em> of a corresponding type.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">A</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The scroll case contains a single scroll of a 1st-level spell</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You transfer the scroll's energy into the scroll case, consuming the scroll, and you can immediately begin casting one of the scroll case's spells.
