            "value": "<p>A <em>spell-bastion</em> rune creates a reservoir of eldritch energy within the shield. A spellcaster can spend 1 minute to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Cast a Spell]{Cast a Spell} of 3rd level or lower into the shield. The spell must take 2 actions or fewer to cast and must be able to target a creature other than the caster. The spell has no immediate effect-it's instead stored for later. When you invest a <em>spell-bastion</em> shield, you immediately know the name and level of the stored spell. A <em>spell-bastion</em> shield found as treasure has a 50% chance of having a spell of the GM's choice stored in it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> Your <em>spell-bastion</em> shield is storing a spell, and you have your shield raised</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You prepare to unleash the stored spell on any foe that hits you until your next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">f</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have a spell stored in your <em>spell-bastion</em> shield, and you've activated the shield since your last turn in preparation for unleashing the spell</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You use the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Shield Block]{Shield Block} reaction against a foe that the stored spell can target</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You unleash the stored spell, which uses the target of the triggering attack as the target of the spell.
