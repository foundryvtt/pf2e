Your chair has a base land Speed of 20 feet if that's faster than your land Speed (for example, if you are an aquatic creature with no land Speed or a very slow land Speed), and your chair has a base swim Speed of 20 feet if that's faster than any swim Speed you have. Additionally, while riding in the chair, you can magically breathe underwater if you normally breathe air, or breathe air if you can normally only breathe underwater.</p>"
