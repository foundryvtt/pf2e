Each volume offers translation for a different language. When working with a book of translation, you can attempt Diplomacy checks to Gather Information or to Make an Impression with creatures that speak the language featured in the book, even if you do not speak the language. Such checks take 10 times longer to complete. An advanced book of translation features more complex phrases, local colloquialisms, and assumes a rudimentary understanding of the featured language. Checks attempted while using an advanced book of translation do not take a circumstance penalty.</p>"
