Select ghost, ghoul, graveknight, lich, mummy, vampire, wight, or zombie. You and up to four allies that hear you read the information aloud during the activation gain a +2 item bonus on attack rolls and saving throws against that type of undead for the next 10 minutes. To benefit from the bonus, your allies must listen attentively and can't perform any other activities during the activation time.</p>"
