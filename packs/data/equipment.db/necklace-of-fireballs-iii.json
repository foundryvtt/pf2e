After you activate a sphere, if you or anyone else hurls it (an Interact action with the ranged trait), it detonates as a fireball where it lands. Your toss can place the center of the fireballed trait), it detonates as a fireball where it lands. Your toss can place the center of the fireball anywhere within 70 feet, though at the GM's discretion you might need to make an attack roll if the throw is unusually challenging. If no one hurls the sphere by the start of your next turn, it turns into a non-magical red bead.</p>"
