If she deems a wielder to be unworthy, <em>Jax</em> uses her dominate ability to control the wielder until she can find a new one.</p>\n<p>If ever used to attack an innocent traveler, or if, in <em>Jax</em>'s opinion, the attack could be considered banditry, the weapon automatically misfires. If <em>Jax</em> witnesses an innocent harmed or killed, she empathically urges her wielder to avenge the victim. If the wielder doesn't comply, <em>Jax</em> attempts to cast dominate (below).
