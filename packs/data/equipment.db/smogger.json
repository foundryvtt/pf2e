You and other creatures in the smog are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Concealed]{Concealed} while inside the smog, and other creatures are concealed to you and other creatures in the smog. A strong wind doesn't disperse the smog but reduces it to a 5-foot- radius emanation. A creature that must breathe that begins its turn inside of the smog can choose to hold its breath as a free action for the round, but if it doesn't, it becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Sickened]{Sickened 1}. The <em>smogger</em> can maintain this effect for up to 1 minute, and the wearer of the <em>smogger</em> can Dismiss the effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> (poison) Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The <em>smogger's</em> above activation is in effect</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The smog created by the <em>smogger</em> thickens into a toxic element that burns the eyes, blisters flesh, and causes fits of coughing.
