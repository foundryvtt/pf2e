Black powder becomes inert and useless when wet and must be kept in a sealed, water-tight container.</p>\n<p>A keg contains 5,000 doses of black powder and can be detonated in the same way as a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Black Powder (Horn)]{Black Powder (Horn)}. As long as the keg is mostly full (at least 4,000 doses remaining) this deals [[/r 3d6[fire]]] damage in a @Template[type:burst|distance:20] (@Check[type:reflex|dc:20|basic:true|name:Gunpowder Detonation] save). Detonating multiple kegs can increase the area, but not the damage, of this effect; detonating a keg and any horns at the same time in an overlapping area also doesn't increase the damage.</p>"
