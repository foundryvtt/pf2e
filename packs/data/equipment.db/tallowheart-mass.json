While some create <em>tallowheart masses</em> that are connected via lengths of scented cord or even fine chain, the mass of tallow is always off-putting in texture, scent, and appearance. Despite the mass's unpleasant look, this magical item can be quite helpful. Each of the three portions can be activated in one of three ways, but once a portion is activated, it's consumed. Once you've consumed all three portions, you fully expend the <em>tallowheart mass</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> If you rub a portion between your hands, the mass melts into your flesh and you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Quickened]{Quickened} condition for 1 minute.
