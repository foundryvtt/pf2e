If its partner goes too long without fighting, the sword misleads its wielder into believing they're the real Armag and that anyone around them who isn't obviously a member of their lineage or following is a mortal enemy. The cursed greatsword also slowly changes the features of the wielder over the course of several days or even weeks to appear as those of the original Armag. If left unchecked, these powers seemingly bring the warlord back to life-it's the wait for this subtle transformation to be complete that's kept the current \"Armag\" in meditation in the tomb for so long. The long-term effects on a PC as a result of this curse are left to the GM to adjudicate, but at the very least should result in a gradual shift of the PCs' alignment to chaotic neutral. If 24 hours pass without <em>Ovinrbaane </em>being used in an encounter of at least moderate difficulty, its partner becomes irritable and short-tempered, and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 2} until the end of their first turn in a moderate or more difficult combat.</p>\n<p><em>Ovinrbaane </em>is a <em>+2 striking wounding greatsword</em>. It can perform all of the following activations, but only does so when its wielder is in combat against a foe the sword deems worthy-that is, any creature of the wielder's level or higher.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> (command)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> three times per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Ovinrbaane casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Bless]{Bless}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">R</span></p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> three times per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> <em>Ovinrbaane's</em> partner becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Immobilized]{Immobilized} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Restrained]{Restrained}</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> <em>Ovinrbaane</em> casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Freedom of Movement]{Freedom of Movement}</em> (heightened to 8th level) on its partner.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">R</span></p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> three times per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An undesirable spell effect with a duration affects <em>Ovinrbaane's</em> partner</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Ovinrbaane casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Dispel Magic]{Dispel Magic}</em> (heightened to 8th level, counteract check [[/r {1d20+31 #Counteract Check]]{+31}) on the spell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> (command)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day;</p>\n<p><strong>Requirement</strong> <em>Ovinrbaane</em> hasn't been wielded in a moderate or more dangerous encounter within the last 24 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Ovinrbaane casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Subconscious Suggestion]{Subconscious Suggestion}</em> (heightened to 8th level, @Check[type:will|dc:34] save) on its partner, suggesting to the partner to attack the next time they face a potential encounter of moderate or greater danger.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> In order to destroy <em>Ovinrbaane</em>, its wielder must bring it to the Boneyard, where they must use the sword to strike three blows against their own gravestone, causing the sword to shatter. How one can find their own gravestone in the Boneyard when they have yet to die and be judged, of course, can be a complex problem to solve, perhaps requiring the destroyer to first die, be judged, sent on to the afterlife, and then be restored to their original mortal life through the result of an epic quest by allies or the whims of a deity. Alternately, if <em>Ovinrbaane</em> is left unused for a hundred years, its magical powers grow dormant. At this time, the weapon can be destroyed normally, although it still has Hardness 30 and 120 Hit Points, and at the end of any round during which it is not destroyed, its dormant powers awaken again if it succeeds at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5]. Since the blade is currently active, this option doesn't present a particularly viable one for PCs seeking the artifact's destruction during the course of the Adventure Path- although sealing it away in a vault could be an excellent first step in this process, entrusting the final destruction of the dangerous artifact to some future generation of hero.</p>"
