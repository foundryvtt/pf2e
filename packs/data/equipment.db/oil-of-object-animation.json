Carefully spreading the oil over an object turns it into an <em>animated object</em> of the same type. For example, sprinkling it on a statue makes an <em>animated statue</em>. If the animated object's level would be greater than 3, the oil struggles to animate it and ultimately fails.</p>\n<p>This animated object has the <em>minion </em>trait, meaning it can use 2 actions when you Command it. You can issue a Command for the current turn as part of the activation. The object remains animated for 1 minute before falling inert. As usual, you can have a maximum of four minions under your control.</p>"
