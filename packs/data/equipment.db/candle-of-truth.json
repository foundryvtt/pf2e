Creatures in the area receive a -4 status penalty to Lie.</p>\n<p>In addition, when first entering the affected area, each creature (including you) must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:26] save or be unable to tell any deliberate lies while within 10 feet of the lit candle. This lasts for as long as the candle is lit. Once lit, the candle burns for 10 minutes, and it cannot be extinguished.</p>"
