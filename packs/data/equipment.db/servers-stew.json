Eating this restaurant-staff favorite empowers you to speak and understand a single language for 1 hour. This must be a language the stew's cook could speak and understand, chosen at the time of the stew's creation. It also helps your words land smoothly, granting you a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks made in that language for the same duration. It doesn't allow you to read the newly acquired language in its written form.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Effect: Server's Stew]{Effect: Server's Stew}</p>"
