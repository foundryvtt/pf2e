            "value": "<p>An <em>oculus of Abaddon</em> is a potent artifact rumored to have been created by one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as a way to reward those who work as their agents on the Material Plane. More likely, these items were crafted by a powerful pre-Earthfall death cult that has long since moved on, leaving behind these dangerous artifacts to tempt mortals into serving the needs of the Horsemen.</p>\n<p>An <em>oculus of Abaddon</em> appears as a sphere of clear crystal that contains a pinpoint of flickering red light at its center. When held, the oculus feels warm to the touch and fills you with a sudden desire to pluck out an eye and place the oculus within the socket-this causes [[/r 4d6[bleed]]] damage. Once placed in an eye socket, the oculus can be removed only by ripping it free (causing the same amount of persistent bleed damage as the initial plucking). When you place the oculus in your empty eye socket, you immediately heal all damage caused by plucking the previous eye out. Once placed, an oculus grants you constant <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Darkvision]{Darkvision}</em>. It can also be activated to perform a number of other magical effects, as detailed below, but if you aren't evil, each time you activate an <em>oculus of Abaddon</em>, you must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:36] save or become affected by a subconscious suggestion (heightened to 8th level) to perform an evil act the next time an opportunity to do so arises, as determined by the GM.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 10 minutes (envision)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> three times per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You gain the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Scrying]{Scrying}</em>, heightened to 7th level.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Cast a Spell]{Cast a Spell}</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per week</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You use the <em>oculus of Abaddon</em> to cast a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Planar Binding]{Planar Binding}</em> ritual, heightened to 7th level. You can only conjure neutral evil creatures with this casting of planar binding. If you already know the planar binding ritual, you gain a +3 item bonus on the primary check when casting planar binding.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">3</span> envision;</p>\n<p><strong>Requirement</strong> you have a familiar or animal companion</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You can see and hear through your familiar or animal companion's eyes and ears, provided you are on the same plane. This effect can be sustained, but as long as you do so you can take no other actions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 1 hour (envision; evil)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per year</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You manipulate the minds of a huge number of targets, provided that the end goal of the manipulation is a tragic or otherwise horrific fate for those being manipulated. This functions as <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Suggestion]{Suggestion}</em>, but with a range of 1 mile. All creatures within this area are affected, with the same suggestion implanted in their minds. Creatures hear the telepathic suggestion in their native language, and creatures that are 7th level or higher can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:36|traits:evil] save to resist the effect. This power was used by Vordakai to cause the vanishing of Varnhold, suggesting to its inhabitants to leave their homes and travel south to his tomb. If this effect is counteracted or removed on one victim, it ends for all victims.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> A foul and hideous object, an <em>oculus of Abaddon</em> is fortunately relatively easy to destroy, as far as artifacts go. It has Hardness 25 and 100 Hit Points, but repairs damage to itself swiftly, regaining 10 Hit Points per round. It has weakness 10 to bludgeoning damage and weakness 30 to good damage.</p>"
