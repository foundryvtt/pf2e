When an activated antler arrow hits a target, bone antlers extend to pin it down. The target must succeed at a @Check[type:reflex|dc:16] save or become stuck to the surface, taking the critical specialization effects of a bow.</p>\n<p>If the hit with the <em>antler arrow</em> is a critical hit and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the DC of the Athletics check increases to 15.</p>"
