            "value": "<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> round</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This iron spike can be fitted into the barrel of a two-handed firearm that doesn't have the scatter property with an Interact action. The spike is attached to a 50-foot-long coil of rope held in a simple spool that can be attached to a weapon's barrel. The weight and awkward balance of the bolt and its spool reduce the range of the weapon by 10 feet when fired. A creature hit by a harpoon bolt takes normal damage from the shot and must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:18] save. On a failure, the harpoon bolt becomes lodged in its body.</p>\n<p>Once a harpoon bolt is lodged, a creature can remove the harpoon bolt with a DC 18 check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Escape]{Escape} or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Force Open]{Force Open}, but on a failure, the creature takes [[/r {1d4}[piercing]]]{1d4 piercing damage}. As long as the harpoon bolt remains lodged, the creature can't move more than 50 feet away from you. You can attempt to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Trip]{Trip} a creature by tugging on the rope attached to the harpoon bolt, even if it isn't within your reach, but if you fail this attempt, the bolt rips free, causing [[/r {1d4}[piercing]]]{1d4 piercing damage} to the target but releasing it from the bolt. If you reload, drop, or fire the firearm again, the creature is no longer limited in its movement. Once a harpoon bolt is removed from a creature, the bolt, its rope, and the spool all decay away, consumed by the same magic that empowers the unusual ammunition to function in the first place.</p>"
