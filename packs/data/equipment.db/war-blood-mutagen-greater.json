You gain a +3 item bonus to your attack rolls with this weapon and to Will saves against fear effects for 1 hour. Any attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Disarm]{Disarm} or otherwise remove the weapon from your hands must exceed DC 40 or the attempt fails.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Effect: War Blood Mutagen (Greater)]{Effect: War Blood Mutagen (Greater)}</p>\n<p><strong>Drawback</strong> You can't voluntarily remove the weapon unless you succeed at a @Check[type:athletics|dc:40], which ends the war blood mutagen's effects; this check takes a single action. If you perform an action with the concentrate trait, you must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] or the action is lost.</p>"
