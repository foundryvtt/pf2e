A darkwood item's Bulk is reduced by 1 (or to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on an item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item made of darkwood is based on the item's normal Bulk, not its reduced Bulk for being made of darkwood, but reduce the Bulk before making any further Bulk adjustments for the size of the item.</p><h2>Darkwood Items</h2>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Darkwood Items</th>\n<th>Hardness</th>\n<th>HP</th>\n<th>BT</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Thin Items</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Standard-grade</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High-grade</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Items</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Standard-grade</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>28</td>\n<td>14</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High-grade</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Structure</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Standard-grade</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>56</td>\n<td>28</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High-grade</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>80</td>\n<td>40</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
