The whistle sprouts from one into several, and then creates a large wooden frame and keyboard. By the time the unfolding is complete, the whistle fully transforms into a calliope, a wagon-sized contraption consisting of several steam whistles played like an organ. The calliope is heavy and anchored in place.</p>\n<p>You have a +1 item bonus to Performance checks to play the calliope. The calliope has a tendency to produce music for a few seconds after you cease playing it, adding a jaunty and overlong conclusion to your music.</p>\n<p>If you use an Interact action to pull the small metal ring on the underside of the <em>marvelous calliope</em>, the calliope collapses back down into a slide whistle.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">D</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You play the calliope, causing it to cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Charm]{Charm}</em> on one of the listeners.</p>"
