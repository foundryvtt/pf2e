The stopper can't be removed unless you speak one of the item's three command words, each of which causes water to pour forth in a different way. Pulling the stopper straight out creates fresh water, and rotating it as you pull creates salt water.

You can direct the stream at a creature, subjecting it to the effects of <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Hydraulic Push]{Hydraulic Push}</em> (spell attack roll +15). You can repeat this once per round as long as the geyser continues, spending an Interact action to direct the geyser each time.</p>"
