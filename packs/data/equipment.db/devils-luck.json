You can't use the benefit against a death effect, and if you roll a failure on a saving throw against a death effect, you get a critical failure instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Termination Clause</strong> If you critically fail a saving throw against a death effect and do not die, the contract becomes unenforceable on its terms and is voided.</p>"
