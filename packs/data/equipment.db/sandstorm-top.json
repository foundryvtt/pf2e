            "value": "<p>On Tekritanin holidays, children reenacted legendary battles of deities by playing with magical tops. Though the paint on this wooden top has long since faded, its magical runes once gleamed yellow-gold and fiery orange, evoking the color of the sky during a sandstorm. To set the top in motion, wind a string around its bottom and upward along its body, and then throw it while gripping the string.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You throw the sandstorm top 10 feet away from you. For 1 minute, as it spins, the top generates a magical sandstorm in a 5-foot radius. Any creature that starts its turn in the area or moves into the area takes [[/r {4d6}[slashing]]]{4d6 slashing damage} (@Check[type:reflex|dc:30|basic:true] save). Additionally, a creature within the sandstorm must hold its breath or begin suffocating.</p>"
