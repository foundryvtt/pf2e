Finally, while in the disguise, the rune attempts to counteract any effects that would reveal your alignment; on a successful counteract check, rather than negate the effect, the rune causes the effect to perceive your alignment as evil (maintaining any lawful or chaotic component of your alignment).</p>\n<p>The wearer can Dismiss the disguise, and if the wearer's armor is removed, the disguise deactivates automatically.</p>"
