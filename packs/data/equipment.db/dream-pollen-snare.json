When inhaled, the pollen imparts a hazy state of profound agreeability. The first creature that enters the snare's space triggers the snare. The creature that triggered the trap must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:18] save. Undead creatures and creatures that don't breathe are immune to dream pollen.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is stupefied 1 for 1 round. For 1 minute, the creature becomes friendly to all creatures to which it was indifferent, or helpful to all creatures to which it was friendly. If the creature was unfriendly or hostile to any creatures, it remains unfriendly or hostile to them. If the creature is an animal, any creature to which it's friendly or helpful can use Diplomacy to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Make an Impression]{Make an Impression} on it and to make very simple Requests of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the duration of the agreeability is 1 hour instead of 1 minute.</p>"
