            "value": "<p>Noqual shields are notoriously difficult to make, requiring highâ€‘grade materials, but they're especially effective against magic. When you have a noqual shield Raised, you gain its circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells that target you (as well as AC).</p>\n<p>Additionally, while the shield is Raised, when an opponent casting a spell that targets you critically fails a spell attack roll against your AC, you can reflect the spell back toward them as a reaction. Attempt a ranged attack roll against the triggering creature using your highest proficiency with a ranged weapon. If you succeed, your opponent takes the effects of a successful spell attack roll for their own spell (or the effects of a critical success if your attack roll was a critical success).</p>\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> noqual worth at least 7,700 gp</p>"
