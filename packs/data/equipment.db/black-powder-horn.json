Black powder becomes inert and useless when wet and must be kept in a sealed, water-tight container.</p>\n<p>A horn contains 500 doses worth of black powder. A horn can be detonated by leaving a small trail of black powder and then lighting it. Each 5-foot square requires one dose of black powder to create a trail through. As long as the horn is mostly full (at least 400 doses remaining) it can be detonated to deal [[/r 1d6[fire]]] damage in a @Template[type:burst|distance:5] (@Check[type:reflex|dc:16|basic:true|name:Gunpowder Detonation] save). It takes 1 round per 15 feet of powder trail laid down for a horn to detonate after the trail is lit. If multiple horns detonate simultaneously, it can increase the area of the explosion, but the damage in overlapping areas doesn't increase.</p>"
