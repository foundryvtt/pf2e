The object doesn't decay, and effects that require the object to be fresh don't count the time passing during this duration as having elapsed. When sprinkled on a corpse, this extends the period in which a creature can be revived by magic, as well as the wait time required before a corpse can be targeted again with <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Talking Corpse]{Talking Corpse}</em>. The salts prevent ordinary pests from consuming the target (such as maggots for a corpse or moths for a piece of clothing). Any creature can use an Interact action to disperse the salts from an unattended object and end this effect.</p>"
