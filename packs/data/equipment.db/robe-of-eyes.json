The highest-level magic aura within 30 feet of you glows in a color that reveals its school to you and allows you to determine where the effect originates. This can narrow down the origin point of the effect to a 5-foot-cube, but not more precisely than that.</p>\n<p>The <em>robe of eyes</em> is not without its dangers. If any spell with the light trait is cast on you or your square while you are wearing the robe, you are blinded for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level unless you succeed at a Fortitude save against the spell's DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span style=\"font-family: 'Pathfinder2eActions'; font-size: 1.8em; display: inline;\">A</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You pluck an eye from the robe and toss it into the air, where it turns invisible and floats to a destination you choose, with the same effect as a 5th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Prying Eye]{Prying Eye} spell.
