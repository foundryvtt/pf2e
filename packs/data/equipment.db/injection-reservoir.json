Immediately after a successful attack with the adjusted weapon, you can inject the target with the loaded poison by activating the reservoir with an Interact action. Refilling the reservoir with a new poison requires 3 Interact actions and uses both hands.</p>\n<p>Adding an injection reservoir to a weapon throws off its balance, causing the multiple attack penalty with the weapon to be one greater than usual (usually –6 on a second attack and –11 on a third; or –5 and –10 with an agile weapon).</p>"
