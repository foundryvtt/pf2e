This fulu is most effective in the lowest area of a building, or near the most valuable or least-waterproof items. They're often seen as the rainy season approaches, with demand spiking just before a particularly large storm hits.</p>\n<p>The fulu slows the spread of flooding water in a 30-foot radius by half, repelling the remaining water away. If the fulu becomes submersed, as the ink dissolves in the water, it releases a rush of heat in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10], harmlessly vaporizing non-magical water in this area into steam and attempting to counteract any magical water effects with a +7 counteract modifier and a counteract level of 2; when this happens, the fulu's duration ends early.</p>"
