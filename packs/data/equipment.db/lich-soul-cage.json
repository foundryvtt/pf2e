            "value": "<p>This item is crafted by a spellcaster who wishes to become a lich. When a lich is destroyed, its soul flees to the <em>soul cage</em>. The phylactery then rebuilds the lich's undead body over the course of [[/br 1d10 #days]]{1d10 days}. Afterward, the lich manifests next to the <em>soul cage</em>, fully healed and in a new body (therefore, it lacks any equipment it had on its old body). A lich's <em>soul cage</em> must be destroyed to prevent a lich from returning.</p>\n<p>The standard <em>soul cage</em> is a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment inscribed with magical phrases. This box has Hardness 9 and 36 HP, but some liches devise more durable or difficult-to-obtain <em>soul cages</em>. A <em>soul cage</em> might also come in the form of a ring, an amulet, or a similar item; the specifics are up to the creator.</p>"
