            "value": "<p>Shaped like a blade made from spinning gears, this <em>+2 greater striking</em> weapon can catch enemy weapons and grind up foes. In order to function, the <em>gearblade</em> must be wound for 10 minutes once every 24 hours. During this process, you can reconfigure the weapon to transform into a bastard sword, greatsword, longsword, or shortsword. It then gains all the features of the chosen weapon except that its Bulk is always 2 and it gains the disarm weapon trait and the versatile B weapon trait (which replaces any other versatile trait the weapon might have). If you don't wind the gearblade, it becomes inert and has the statistics of a greatclub.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You've wound the gearblade for 10 minutes within the last 24 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You roll a critical success to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Disarm]{Disarm} a target with the gearblade</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The target's weapon is pulled through the gearblade's gears and shoots out the other side, landing 20 feet away in a direction of your choice. The target must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:36] save. On a failure, the limb holding their weapon is also pulled into the <em>gearblade</em>, and the creature takes [[/r 3d12[bludgeoning]]] damage. On a critical failure, they take [[/r 6d12[bludgeoning]]] damage and the limb becomes unusable until healed by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Regenerate]{Regenerate}</em> spell or a similar effect.</p>"
