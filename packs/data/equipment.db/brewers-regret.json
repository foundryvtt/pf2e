            "value": "<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When a brewer makes a batch of something they'd rather not drink, they often boil it down; add myrrh, mugwort extract, and violet salt; and sell it to chefs looking for cheap sandwich fillings. The thick, salty sourness ruins the taste of most other food, but it also creates a strong desire to live to taste anything else. For 1 hour after consumption, you gain a +2 item bonus to saves against death and negative effects. In addition, your doomed value decreases by 1 (minimum 0). You can reduce the doomed condition with brewer's regret only once per day, and after you do, you can't reduce the doomed condition from the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Restoration]{Restoration}</em> spell that same day (or vice versa).</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Effect: Brewer's Regret]{Effect: Brewer's Regret}</p>"
