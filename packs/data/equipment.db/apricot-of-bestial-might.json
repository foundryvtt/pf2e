When you eat an apricot of bestial might, you transform into a boar-faced battle form with scaly skin. You can use feats with this item as if it were a bestial mutagen, improving your tusk unarmed attack as if it were a claw or jaws attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong> You gain 8 resistance to all physical damage and gain a tusk unarmed attack with the deadly d12 trait that deals 1d10 piercing damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Drawback</strong> You become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1}. If you perform an action with the auditory or linguistic traits, you must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] or the action is lost.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Effect: Apricot of Bestial Might]{Effect: Apricot of Bestial Might}</p>"
