Popular among many of Restov's explorers, traders, and mercenaries, often a person carries several lover's knots on their person in case of emergency. While the original lover's knots were specific rewards granted by a particularly flirtatious Swordlord to her favored agents, time has seen these talismans become much more widespread through southern Brevoy. When you activate a lover's knot, you regain [[/r {2d6} #Hit Points]]{2d6 Hit Points}. If you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Battle Medicine]{Battle Medicine} feat, you instead regain [[/r {2d6+7} #Hit Points]]{2d6+7 Hit Points}.</p>"
