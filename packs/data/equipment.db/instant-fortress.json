Arrow slits along the lower battlements and crenelations at the top provide standard cover to anyone within the fortress. There's no roof, leaving an open, 10-foot-square vertical shaft through the center of the structure.</p>\n<p>As a magical structure, the fortress has the structure trait. Because it expands outward, the fortress can't catch creatures inside it as a magical structure normally does. Instead, it pushes those creatures back. It can't push a creature into a surface or hazard this way, and stops expanding if that would happen.</p>\n<p>The fortress has a single door in the center of one wall on the ground level, and the door appears directly in front of you when you activate the fortress. Provided you're within 100 feet of the door, you can cause the door to open or slam shut and lock by spending a single action to issue a verbal command, which has the auditory trait. The DC to Force Open the door or Pick its Lock is 40.</p>\n<p>You can instantly return the instant fortress to its cube form by spending a single action to issue a verbal command, which has the auditory trait. Once deactivated, the fortress can't be activated again for 4 hours.</p>\n<p>If the fortress becomes damaged, it can be repaired only with a remake spell or by someone who is legendary at Crafting.</p>"
