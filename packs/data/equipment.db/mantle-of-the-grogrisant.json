It was fashioned from the pelt of Grogrisant itself, after being slain by Taldaris, and Grogrisant's mane was fashioned into a thick fringe that runs all along the mantle's edges. The paws of the Grogrisant cross beneath the wearer's throat, giving you an imposing appearance. The <em>Mantle of the Grogrisant</em> grants you fire resistance 15 and physical resistance 5 (except bludgeoning).</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> envision, Interact (evocation, incapacitation, light, primal, visual)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You pull the hood of the mantle over your face, revealing the six eyes of Grogrisant. The mantle gives off a flash of blinding light in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:60].
