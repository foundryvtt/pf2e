While on, the coils electrify the cable, dealing [[/r {1d6}[electricity]]]{1d6 electricity} and [[/r {1d6}[fire]]]{1d6 fire damage} in a thin precise line to anything the cable touches, though the cable is too unwieldy to use as a weapon. Electrocables are typically used to \"cut\" a thin straight line through metal. They ignore 10 points of a metal object's hardness.</p>"
