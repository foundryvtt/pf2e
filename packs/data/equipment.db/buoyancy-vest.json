If you end your turn in water while wearing a buoyancy vest and haven't succeeded at a Swim action that turn, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:5].</p>\n<p>On a success, you do not sink, though you can still get moved by the current, as determined by the GM. The GM can also determine whether the vest is more or less effective in different weather conditions, raising the DC in rough waters or lowering the DC in calm water.</p>"
