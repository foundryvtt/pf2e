Traveler's cloaks for hot climates might be bleached white and created from lighter materials, while those intended for cold climates are made of thicker materials and have linings intended to retain heat. While wearing a traveler's cloak for the appropriate type of weather, increase the time it takes to become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Fatigued]{Fatigued} from temperature effects by 2 hours. A traveler's cloak has no effect at extreme or incredible temperatures.</p>"
