If you are undead, you gain resistance 40 to positive damage. If you are not undead, the helm quickly saps the life from you, dealing [[/r {10d6}[negative]]]{10d6 negative damage} to you every round.

Naraga appears in an adjacent appropriate space, and if no such space is available, she does not appear. Naraga follows your commands without question. She remains for up to 1 hour or until you use an Interact action to dismiss her, after which she reverts back to the helm. If Naraga is slain, she immediately reverts back to the helm and can't be summoned for 1 week. You don't receive any of the helm's other benefits while it is transformed.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> The helm is utterly obliterated if crushed between the jaws of an ancient black dragon's skull located in a desert while the sun is at its zenith.</p>"
