Each meal must be ladled from the cauldron individually as a 3-action activity and must be eaten within 1 hour of removal. An undead creature that consumes a meal from the cauldron regains [[/r {5d8}[Healing]]]{5d8 Hit Points} and gains the benefits of 4th-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Restoration]{Restoration}</em> that you choose; living creatures who consume a meal from the cauldron take [[/r 5d8[negative]]] damage (@Check[type:fortitude|dc:27|basic:true]) instead. Any meals remaining in the cauldron 24 hours after activation become inedible slurry.</p>"
