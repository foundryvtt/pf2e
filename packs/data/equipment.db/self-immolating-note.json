The item activates automatically when the envelope is opened, which typically takes an Interact action. Anyone holding the note when it catches fire takes [[/r 1[fire]]] damage. Often, these notes are given as practical jokes or threats, but secret societies find them quite useful when sharing information about upcoming meetings or any other relevant news. These letters must be written in haste and require the use of their accompanying envelopes, which prevent air from interacting with the paper until the envelope's seal is broken.</p>"
