            "value": "<p>As you Craft your <em>soul cage</em>, you trap your soul within it, an integral part of the complicated process of becoming a lich. When you're destroyed, your soul flees to the <em>soul cage</em>, which rebuilds your undead body over the course of [[/r 1d10 #Days to Rebuild Body]] days. Afterward, you manifest next to the <em>soul cage</em>, fully healed and in a new body (lacking any equipment you had on your old body). Only destroying your <em>soul cage</em> can prevent you from returning.</p>\n<p>You choose the form of your <em>soul cage</em> when you Craft it. A few options include a miniature cage, a ring, an amulet, or a crown. Work with your GM to adjust the usage and Bulk as needed, though a soul cage is rarely more than light Bulk. The soul cage has Hardness 9 and 36 HP.</p>\n<p>If your <em>soul cage</em> is destroyed but you aren't, you can attempt to find your soul and trap it again, building a new soul cage. This is no trivial feat and often takes an entire adventure to accomplish. If you don't cage your soul again, you suffer a long decline.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> You have Lich Dedication.</p>"
