Handles on the bottom of the balloon allow up to two creatures sized Medium or smaller to hold onto the balloon. One round after being activated, the balloon rises up into the air at a speed of 20 feet per round. After rising for 3 rounds, the balloon floats in place for two rounds as the air inside cools, then descends at a speed of 20 feet per round. When the balloon reaches its original elevation, the balloon deflates.</p>"
