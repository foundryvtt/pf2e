Once activated, the mask sharpens odors, giving you imprecise scent with a 15 foot range. You can't wear other masks while you're wearing a bloodhound mask.</p>\n<p>When you use Survival to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Track]{Track} a creature by its scent, your proficiency bonus is equal to your level even if you're untrained, and the mask grants you a +1 item bonus to your Survival check. The GM sets the Survival DC based on the area's ability to hold scent rather than on visual clues, as normal for using scent.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Effect: Bloodhound Mask (Lesser)]{Effect: Bloodhound Mask (Lesser)}</p>"
