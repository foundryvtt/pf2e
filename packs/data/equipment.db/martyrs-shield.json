In addition to good-naturedly attempting to convert you to its religion, the martyr's shield can use 1 reaction each round that, when raised, it uses to Shield Block to protect an ally adjacent to you, with the effects of the Shield Warden feat. The martyr's shield uses this reaction whether you would prefer it did so or not. The martyr's shield can be upgraded to a stronger form of sturdy shield by paying the difference in cost between its current type of sturdy shield and the new type.</p>"
