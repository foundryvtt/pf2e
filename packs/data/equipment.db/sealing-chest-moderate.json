Up to 1 Bulk of objects can be placed inside a sealing chest; the magic auras and curses of any objects placed within the chest cannot extend beyond the box unless they are of a greater level than the chest. Artifacts and similarly powerful items are unaffected regardless of level. Many cursed items prevent their bearer from removing them, but a successful remove curse gives enough time to stash the item in the chest.</p>"
