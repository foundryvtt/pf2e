They are rare outside of the Boneyard, so it's common for psychopomps venturing to other planes to carry a nosoi facsimile to aid in their travels. This tiny icon of a masked raven emits twittering sounds in perfect accompaniment to your performances. You gain a +2 item bonus to Performance checks to play an instrument, orate, or sing. You can cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Sending]{Sending}</em> once per day as a divine innate spell.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-effects.Effect: Nosoi Charm (Performance)]{Effect: Nosoi Charm (Performance)}</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">3</span> Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You twist the base of the charm, and the twittering it emits becomes helpful words to boost your arguments.
