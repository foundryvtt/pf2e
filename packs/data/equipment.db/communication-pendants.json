Your voice can be heard by whoever is wearing the other pendant no matter how far away the pendants are from each other, as long as the wearer has invested the other pendant and is on the same plane as you. Continued activation allows you to communicate with the other pendant's wearer whenever and for as long as your desire.</p>"
