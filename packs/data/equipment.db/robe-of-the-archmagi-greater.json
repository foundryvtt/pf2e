Good robes are white, neutral robes are gray, and evil robes are black. An evil or good robe gains the appropriate trait. The robes benefit only characters who can cast arcane spells and whose alignment on the good-evil axis matches that of the robe. If your alignment does not match that of the robe, or you are not an arcane spellcaster, you are instead stupefied 2 while wearing a robe of the archmagi. This condition can't be removed in any way until you remove the robe.</p>\n<p>The robes are <em>+2 greater resilient explorer's clothing</em>, and they grant a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against arcane spells and resistance 10 to damage from arcane spells.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">R</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You or an ally within 30 feet attempts a saving throw against an arcane spell, but you haven't rolled yet</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You or the ally automatically succeed at your save against the triggering arcane spell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> You are an arcane spellcaster.</p>"
