In its first form, the mask depicts a silvery and angelic face; while wearing the mask in this form, your alignment appears as lawful good to creatures attempting to detect your alignment. In its second form, the mask depicts a gold-skinned demonic face; while wearing the mask in this form, your alignment appears as chaotic evil to creatures attempting to detect your alignment. If you die while wearing the mask, a fragment of your soul is trapped in the mask, forming a life link. If there was already a soul fragment in the mask when this happens, you roll a @Check[type:will] save against the Will DC of the person who left the previous fragment. If you succeed, your soul fragment replaces the old one. On a failure, you die normally.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You switch the mask to its other form.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Crisis of Faith]{Crisis of Faith}</em> (@Check[type:will|dc:34|name:Crisis of Faith|traits:divine,enchantment,mental]), targeting up to four creatures within 30 feet.
