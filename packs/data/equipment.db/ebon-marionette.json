You might command the creature to throw down its weapon, run away, or attack an ally. Whenever you issue a command, the creature must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:28] save or be forced to follow the command as its first action on its next turn. If you command it to do something that takes more than 1 action, it accomplishes only as much as it can with 1 action. You can Sustain the Activation for up to 1 minute; each time you do, you give the target another command by manipulating the marionette, and the target makes another Will save. If the target succeeds at its save, the effect ends. Sustaining the Activation has no effect if the creature already has a command, so you can't dictate more than one of its actions per turn.</p>"
