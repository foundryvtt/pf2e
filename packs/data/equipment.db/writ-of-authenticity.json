The top seal is always the Glyph of the Open Road and the middle one is the Envoy's Alliance open door emblem. The bottom seal uses the preparer's personal sigil.</p>\n<p>Inside, the text describes a specific instance of a legitimate business activity, with blanks for the Pathfinder to fill in and personalize the writ to the persons and activity desired.</p>\n<p>Presenting a writ of authenticity grants a +2 item bonus to Make a Request for the associated business, assuming the writ is legitimate and the viewer expects to work with the Pathfinder Society for that activity.</p>"
