The wheel spikes can have runes upgraded, transferred, or added as normal.

Stride in a straight line, moving through enemies' spaces and making an attack with the wheel spikes against every foe in the line. If the foe is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Prone]{Prone}, the following effects apply: the attack gains a +1 circumstance bonus to damage per weapon damage die, and the wounding rune deals [[/r {1d12}[persistent,bleed]]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Persistent Damage]{Persistent Bleed Damage} on a hit (or @Localize[PF2E.PersistentDamage.Bleed3d6.success] on a critical hit).</p>"
