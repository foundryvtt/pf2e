Avarneus's version requires another dose of lover's ink and a specific agitation to reveal the hidden message, preventing casual interception. Any message written with lovers' ink is revealed by applying a page worth of lover's ink and vigorously shaking, requiring 3 Interact actions. A typical vial provides enough ink to fill 1 page worth of text. While the text is hidden, a creature closely examining a surface marked with lover's ink can detect the presence of the ink with a successful @Check[type:perception|dc:25|traits:action:seek] check. On a critical success, they can make out the ink well enough to use Society to Decipher Writing.</p>"
