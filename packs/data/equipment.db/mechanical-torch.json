            "value": "<p>Powered by electricity, you can turn a mechanical torch on and off by toggling a lever on the torch with an Interact action. When active, the torch sheds bright light in either a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 40 feet) or a 40â€‘foot cone (and dim light to the next 40 feet). Changing this area requires a single Interact action to flip a switch. The torch carries sufficient charge to operate for ten minutes. You can recharge the torch in 1 minute via an integrated crank-charging mechanism, turning the clockwork gears and generating sparks to power the torch, though doing so requires two hands</p>"
