The ammunition ignores up to 10 of a target's resistance, and it can penetrate walls up to 1 foot thick with Hardness 10 or less. Each target that takes damage from this ammunition also takes @Localize[PF2E.PersistentDamage.Bleed1d6.success].</p>\n<p>If your attack roll result is a natural 20, you improve your degree of success only against the first target in the line, but you can still score a critical hit on other targets if your result exceeds their AC by 10 or more.</p>\n<p>If you have access to your bow's critical specialization effect, penetrating ammunition applies that effect only against a target in the last square of the line.</p>"
