The glasses rely on your latent memories, so if the creature is disguising their identity, the glasses don't penetrate the disguise. If a doppelganger was disguised as an innkeeper you met, the glasses would give you the innkeeper's name, and if a noble you met before was in disguise as a masked vigilante, the glasses wouldn't reveal their name.</p>"
