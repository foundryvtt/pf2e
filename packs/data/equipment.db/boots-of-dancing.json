While you wear the boots, the curse activates whenever you attempt an Athletics check or Stride more than once in a single round during an encounter. The boots cast an 8th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Uncontrollable Dance]{Uncontrollable Dance}</em> spell on you, and you automatically fail your save. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the boots fuse to you.</p>"
