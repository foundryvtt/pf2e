To activate the diamond, place it on the relatively intact body of a creature that died within the past year. The stone shatters, restoring the recipient to life with the effects of a successful <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Resurrect]{Resurrect}</em> ritual, except there is no limit to the level of the creature that may be revived.</p>\n<p>This gift of life comes with a terrible cost: the recipient believes you-and anyone else who aided in the resurrection- deliberately caused their death and revived them only in furtherance of some nefarious scheme. Having a proxy activate the <em>gift of the poisoned heart</em> is of no use, as the item's magic sniffs out all coconspirators and uses your attempt to avoid the drawback to feed the resurrected creature's paranoia.</p>\n<p>No amount of information or persuasion can alleviate this mistrust, as the cursed creature twists the facts endlessly to fit their delusion. Only magic such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Remove Curse]{Remove Curse}</em> can neutralize this effect, and the subject resists any attempt to alter their beliefs by magic.</p>"
