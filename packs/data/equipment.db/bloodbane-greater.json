When you damage an appropriate type of creature with the weapon, that creature takes @Localize[PF2E.PersistentDamage.Bleed1d4.success]. The type of creature depends on the clan that made the dagger, but is typically drow, duergar, giant, or orc.</p>\n<p>In addition, whenever you inflict persistent bleed damage with a <em>bloodbane</em> weapon (whether from its innate ability or in some other way), the weapon leaves ragged wounds. The bleeding creature must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:30|name:Greater Bloodbane] save or become sickened 1. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.</p>"
