While you have the Emerald Fulcrum Lens invested, your flesh appears waxen and pallid. You gain negative healing and harm spells gain a +4 status bonus to the Hit Points they restore to you. You can also activate the lens in the following ways.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> Interact (healing)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You grasp the Emerald Fulcrum Lens in one hand, regain 30 Hit Points, and gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against magic for 1 round.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-effects.Effect: Emerald Fulcrum Lens (Saving Throw)]{Effect: Emerald Fulcrum Lens (Saving Throw)}</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> Interact (attack, possession)</p>\n<p>While grasping the lens, make a melee spell attack roll with a modifier of +20. On a hit, you force the splinter of Nhimbaloth's essence from the lens to possess the target. You're no longer invested in the lens, and the target gains the benefits as though it had invested the lens but can't activate the lens's other abilities. This effect is permanent, but it can be ended by any effect that removes a possession effect. The lens doesn't have any magical abilities until the possession effect ends; when it does, the essence returns to the lens.</p>"
