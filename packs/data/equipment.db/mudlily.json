            "value": "<p>This golden flower grows amid filthy ponds or puddles, its spotless yellow petals sharply contrasting its soiled surroundings. You can pin a <em>mudlily</em> to your clothing or your hair to enjoy some of its magical sullying and cleaning properties. While you wear a clean <em>mudlily</em>, you gradually become dirty over the course of an hour; grime and mud subtly manifest from nowhere onto your clothes, hair, skin, and all of your possessions other than the <em>mudlily</em>. After just 1 hour, you appear as though you've been living in squalor for years. This filth can be washed away normally, but it inevitably returns as long as you continue to wear a clean <em>mudlily</em>.</p>\n<p>If you soil the mudlily with some dirt or mud, as long as you wear the flower, you instead become clean over an hour. Any gunk soiling your person vanishes completely from everywhere on your body except the <em>mudlily</em>. Each day at dawn, the <em>mudlily</em> instantly becomes clean again.</p>"
