When emptied into an adjacent body of water, the pellets freeze the water's surface almost instantly, creating an ice block in a 10-foot square to a depth of 1 foot. Any creatures inside this space must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:23|name:Avoid Being Frozen in Ice|traits:damaging-effect|showDC:all] save. On a failure, the creature takes [[/r 2d6[cold]]] damage and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Immobilized]{Immobilized} for 1 minute or until it Escapes (DC 20) or the ice is broken. The entire ice block has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits, cold damage, and precision damage. The ice is strong enough to support one Large creature or up to four Medium or Small creatures. Traversing the slippery ice requires a successful @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:20|name:Balance on Ice|traits:alchemical,action:balance|showDC:all] check to Balance.</p>"
