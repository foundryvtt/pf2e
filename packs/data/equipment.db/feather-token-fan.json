Activating a feather token causes it to transform into another object, which then can be used as normal for that object. Each feather can be activated only once, with most of them permanently becoming the item in their description.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">A</span> Interact</p>\n<p>Activating this feather requires you to fan it in a given direction. If this direction is toward the sail of a vessel, the feather flutters up toward the sail and fans continuously, filling the sail with air and granting the vessel a +10-foot circumstance bonus to its Speed for 8 hours. If fanned in any other direction, it instead produces a single casting of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Gust of Wind]{Gust of Wind}</em> (DC 20).</p>"
