A funnel-shaped trumpet protrudes from the box's top at an angle, though it feels surprisingly light.

The music is so loud that any creature within 60 feet must succeed at a <span data-pf2-check=\"fortitude\" data-pf2-dc=\"24\" data-pf2-traits=\"auditory,evocation,magical\" data-pf2-label=\"Deafening Music Box DC\" data-pf2-show-dc=\"gm\">Fortitude</span> save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Deafened]{Deafened} for as long as they remain within 60 feet of the music box, and for 1 minute thereafter.
