When you speak, others are inclined to listen to you, perhaps due to the divine spark of your connection to Ragdya. You gain one cantrip from the divine spell list; this cantrip can't deal damage or otherwise cause direct harm. You can cast this spell as a divine innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.</p>"
