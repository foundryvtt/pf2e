This means you can use your sense of smell to determine a creature's location. The GM will usually double the range if you're downwind from the creature or halve the range if you're upwind.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Track]{Track} a creature or object if you've smelled it before.</p>"
