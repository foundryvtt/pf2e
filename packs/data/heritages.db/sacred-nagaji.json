Legends claim your ancestors were faithful snakes uplifted by Nalinivati rather than nagaji created by the goddess. Instead of a fangs unarmed attack, you have a tail attack that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage, is in the brawling weapon group, and has the finesse and unarmed traits. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Grapple]{Grapple} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Trip]{Trip} you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against effects that would @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Grabbed]{Grab} you, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Restrained]{Restrain} you, or knock you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Prone]{Prone}.</p>"
