            "value": "<p><em>Technological wonders from another world, androids have synthetic bodies and living </em><em>souls. Their dual nature makes them quick-thinking and calm under pressure, but </em><em>comfortable in stillness and solitude.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Androids first arrived on Golarion during the Rain of Stars, when an interstellar vessel from the far-off planet of Androffa crash-landed, scattering debris across Numeria. While some android survivors of this crash still walk Golarion today, most were created from the technological pods, known as foundries, that operate sporadically amid the starship's wreckage. Androids birthed from these mechanical wombs possess mature bodies and newborn souls, both organic and synthetic; they emerge knowing only their creators' language and the motor skills necessary for survival. They have no understanding of their surroundings, origin, or purpose. Most learn how to behave through keen observation while wandering Numeria.</p>\n<p>Androids tend to be logical introverts, rational and contemplative. Insatiably curious, with an urge to understand themselves and the world around them, androids place great value on intellectual pursuits. They have difficulty interpreting and expressing emotions, both in themselves and in others, which makes them seem distant and uncaring. While androids can forge emotional bonds, they find it more difficult to connect with non-androids.</p>\n<p>If you want a character that's a synthetic foreigner in a fantastic world, forced to learn the nuances of reality and society through the powers of observation and logic alone, you should play an android.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep your identity a secret, assuming others want to exploit or harm you.</li>\n<li>Plan ahead, preparing multiple contingencies for even simple tasks.</li>\n<li>Calculate the repercussions of your actions, inventions, and thoughts before sharing them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you understand how to operate technology and that you can capably communicate with constructs and robots.</li>\n<li>Believe you to be immortal and envy your eternal youth and vigor.</li>\n<li>Think you have no feelings and that you can't form emotional connections with others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Androids were created in humanity's image; thus, foundries produce androids that represent all humankind. Androids display great diversity in coloration and ethnicity, height and body shape, and gender identity. Androids breathe, eat, and sleep like a human, although they're incapable of biological procreation. Their bodies contain microscopic nanites, transported by fluid too watery to be blood, that manage their organic processes. These nanites are controlled through biological circuitry that resembles tattoos and is typically located along an android's hands, forearms, face, or neck. Many androids can harness their nanites to increase their bodies' efficiency, causing the circuitry to glow.</p>\n<p>Androids don't grow old. Instead, their organic appearance becomes less convincing over time, causing them to look more artificial. After a century, most androids feel their time coming to an end and willingly release their souls to the Boneyard to face Pharasma's judgment. Their bodies then shut down, entering a lifeless hibernation as their nanites begin restoration protocol and reset their synthetic bodies to their original manufactured state. After a few weeks, a new soul enters the android's form, triggering reinitialization. This process, called Renewal, is an event to be celebrated, akin to bearing a child. Those that die by violence can't Renew, so androids go to great lengths to protect themselves and their brethren from harm.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Androids have a history of being exploited, enslaved, and destroyed by their Numerian neighbors, so they hide in order to survive. Most choose to keep their ancestry secret by integrating into human society or by adapting to a nomadic lifestyle. Some androids eschew humanity to live among their kind. Such groups often remain small by necessity; while a pair of androids can avoid danger through careful secrecy, large groups attract too much attention.</p>\n<p>Android communities are efficient and highly organized. Each citizen understands their role and takes pride in filling it effectively. Debates and lectures frequently occur, as androids seek to understand themselves and their world through education and inquiry. These insular and secretive enclaves relocate when discovered.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Most androids are neutral. They care for their own safety and that of their companions and their kind. Androids interested in religion usually worship Casandalee or Brigh, goddesses that unite invention and life. Other popular deities include Desna, Irori, and Gozreh.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Androids adopt the naming conventions of their surrounding societies, while those raised among their own kind instead select a single name that utilizes Androffan phonology. Occasionally, such androids add a numerical designation to their names, denoting how many generations their body has hosted life as a kind of homage to their bloodline.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Anati, Daniv, Era-4, Feralia, Gelegor, Ilgos-5, Koresh, Oris, Prime, Urdun, Verity-3, Ymry</p>"
