The DC of the check to Distract Gage is 27. However, each time the character makes the same type of check (or uses the same item, spell, or other ability) to Distract Gage, the DC of the check increases by 2.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The character manages to distract Gage to such a degree that he doesn't even think to check for his key until the party accrues the next increment of 5 Awareness Points.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The character successfully distracts Gage, who doesn't check for his key this round.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> Gage is not distracted and might check for his key, but the character can reattempt this obstacle.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Gage loses interest in the character, and that character cannot try to Distract Gage again.</p>",
