    "content": "<p>A character can cause considerable confusion (and thus create an opening for the party) by impersonating Gage through clever use of a disguise, either mundane or magical. A character can attempt this opportunity at any point, though the ruse is risky: Each time the impersonating character interacts with a guard, bodyguard, or bouncer, the party automatically accrues 1 Awareness Point. In exchange, the character can roll a Deception check in place of any of the listed checks to overcome a particular obstacle (as long doing so would make sense, of course, per GM discretion; the most obvious application of the disguise is bypassing the vault guards obstacle). However, if at any time Gage himself sees the impersonator, the party has 1 round to respond to the disaster or the heist is a failure.</p>",
