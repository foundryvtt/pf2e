    "content": "<p>At a casino like the Lucky Nimbus, one of the best ways to blend in is to play a game or two. Each player should specify whether or not they are participating and, if so, the amount they are wagering. You can simulate any of the casino games presented in the Adventure Toolbox by actually playing them at the table with a deck of cards or dice. Alternatively, you can simplify these games by reducing them to simple skill checks, comparing the results of all the bidders' Deception or Games Lore checks for golem or bounder (century is all luck-based, so skill checks wouldn't make sense for that game). The minimum bid for any game is 1 gp, but you might have NPC players bid as much as 50 or even 100 gp to drastically raise the stakes. In any case, a player might try to palm a card or pass a secret message to an ally with a DC 27 Thievery check or a DC 25 Deception check.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The player wins the hand so grandly that it attracts positive attention from nearby spectators. The player earns 1 IP, which must be used before the end of the round or it is forfeited.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The player succeeds at cheating and wins the hand. Multiple subsequent successes might generate Infiltration Points, as above, according to the GM's discretion.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The player fails to cheat.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The player is banned from further games, and the party accrues 2 AP.</p>",
