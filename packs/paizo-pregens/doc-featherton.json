                    "value": "<p><em>As unpredictable and varied as any of Golarion's peoples, humans have exceptional drive and the capacity to endure and expand. Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea. Human characters can be any of these ethnicities, regardless of what lands they call home.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Characters of human ethnicities in the Inner Sea region speak Common (also known as Taldane), and some ethnicities grant access to an uncommon language.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Human Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Two free ability boosts</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

At 1st level, your way grants you an initial deed, a unique reload action called a slinger's reload, and proficiency with a particular skill. You also gain advanced and greater deeds at later levels, as well as access to way-specific feats. The gunslinger ways are described in detail on page 108. The following ways are presented in this book.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Drifter</strong> You wander across the battlefield, equally at home in and out of the fray.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Pistolero</strong> You carefully maintain your distance at a duelist's 10 paces with pistol in hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Sniper</strong> You practice a methodical style of shooting, striking from far cover.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Vanguard</strong> You rely on a brutal combat style that uses heavy weapons and explosive attacks.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinger Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a gunslinger class feat.</p>\n<h2>Singular Expertise</h2>\n<p>You have particular expertise with guns and crossbows that grants you greater proficiency with them and the ability to deal more damage. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage rolls with firearms and crossbows.</p>\n<p>This intense focus on firearms and crossbows prevents you from reaching the same heights with other weapons. Your proficiency with unarmed attacks and with weapons other than firearms and crossbows can't be higher than trained, even if you gain an ability that would increase your proficiency in one or more other weapons to match your highest weapon proficiency (such as the weapon expertise feats many ancestries have). If you have gunslinger weapon mastery, the limit is expert, and if you have gunslinging legend, the limit is master.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Stubborn<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You don't like being told what to do, and you don't give up. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert. When you fail, but don't critically fail, a Will save against an effect that would give you the controlled condition, you can attempt a second save against the effect at the start of your next turn. On a successful second save, the controlled condition ends, though any other effects remain. As normal, failing this second save doesn't allow you to attempt a third save on the subsequent turn.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinger Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand the best way to utilize your unique weapons. Your proficiency rank increases to master with simple and martial firearms and crossbows. Your proficiency rank for advanced firearms and crossbows, simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects for firearms and crossbows.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Deed<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned a powerful new technique of your chosen way. You gain the advanced deed ability of the way you chose at 1st level.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinger Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your special shots become harder for opponents to predict or resist. Your proficiency rank for your gunslinger class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Evasion<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Gunslinging Legend<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned unique techniques for wielding firearms and crossbows that give you unmatched skill in their use. Your proficiency rank increases to legendary with simple and martial firearms and crossbows and to master with advanced firearms and crossbows. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Greater Deed<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You've mastered the pinnacle technique of your chosen way. You gain the greater deed ability of the way you chose at 1st level.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your body has become accustomed to physical hazards and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Shootist's Edge<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You make shots others find impossible. Your proficiency rank for your gunslinger class DC increases to master. When using a ranged weapon in which you have master or greater proficiency, you ignore the penalty for attacking within the weapon's second and third range increments.</p>\n<h2>Incredible Senses<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You notice things that most people can't detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge or absorb blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to master.</p>"

Doc was born in Absalom but has spent years traveling around the Inner Sea, using her skills as a medic and surgeon to pay her way. While Doc does have talent as a physician, she's also been known to overestimate that talent, leaving bereaved families and incensed sheriffs in her wake.</p>\n<p>Doc's skills aren't just limited to treating wounds and performing surgeries with various degrees of success, however. Doc has a pair of pistols she's affectionately named \"Problem\" and \"Solution\"; when she's in a situation she can't outrun or talk her way out of, Problem's razor-sharp bayonet or a spray of pellets from Solution often turn the tides back in her favor.</p>\n<p>Doc's guns have rested in their holsters for a few months now thanks to her intimidating new companion, Booker; she's spent the last few weeks playing cards and selling her services as a physician when the cards turn against her. Still, she's feeling that tingle in her feet telling her to run that usually means trouble is coming.</p>",
