                    "value": "<p><em>Every kobold knows that their slight frame belies true, mighty draconic power. They are ingenious crafters and devoted allies within their warrens, but those who trespass into their territory find them to be inspired skirmishers, especially when they have the backing of a draconic sorcerer or true dragon overlord. However, these reptilian opportunists prove happy to cooperate with other humanoids when it's to their benefit, combining caution and cunning to make their fortunes in the wider world.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Kobolds are resourceful survivors whose snare-guarded warrens and opportunistic scavenging have cast them as villains to most other humanoids, with their draconic reverence lending them a reputation as mere minions and nuisances. Yet some kobolds have emerged from their secluded warrens seeking the relative safety of surface settlements, the lucrative prospects of the adventuring life, or validating awe from followers of their own.</p>\n<p>If you want a character with oversized confidence, deadly cunning, and the ancient power of dragons flowing through their veins, you should play a kobold.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Take pride in your draconic connections, whether you believe dragons are your ancestors or simply patrons.</li>\n<li>Analyze your surroundings, always looking for ambushes, advantageous terrain, and escape routes.</li>\n<li>Naturally observe, adopt, and respect group dynamics, whether as leader, subordinate, or equal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume that you are cowardly and won't stick around in the face of danger.</li>\n<li>Appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness, especially when it comes to building defenses.</li>\n<li>Consider your claims of draconic power to be overblown, delusional, or endearing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kobolds are short (about 3 feet tall) reptilian humanoids with slender bodies and long tails. They often boast distant draconic ancestry, and every kobold displays one or more draconic features, such as stout horns, razor-sharp teeth, or—more rarely—vestigial wings or draconic breath. They mature quickly, reaching adulthood by about 12 years and living to about 60.</p>\n<p>The color of a kobold's scales can vary widely. Most often, they mimic the hues of chromatic or metallic dragons, with a mix of slightly darker or lighter scales that create a mottled appearance. The scales of newly hatched kobolds often reflect the community's draconic exemplar, whether that's the dragon they currently serve or the dragon type from which they're descended.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Kobolds have an ingrained cautiousness that keeps them alive. They're secretive or subservient around powerful creatures to avoid becoming victims. This meekness fades once kobolds secure either a formidable patron (like a dragon) or a potent source of supernatural power (like an artifact or sorcerous leader). They often achieve an unshakable fervor and loyalty to their new cause or leader. However, kobolds are infamous for sensing a proverbial sinking ship, and once their source of power fails or seems doomed, their morale breaks swiftly.</p>\n<p>Whether led by a dragon or not, kobolds almost always identify themselves with a type of dragon that serves as their spiritual exemplar. Their societies regularly adopt laws and cultural norms inspired by the exemplar's personality.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>All but the most iconoclastic kobolds have a natural respect for hierarchies and rules, and so kobolds are rarely chaotic. Kobold adventurers tend to be lawful neutral or neutral, relying on their ancestral social strategies for survival.</p>\n<p>Organized religion feels natural for most kobolds, especially when a deity assumes a commanding or tyrannical disposition. Many gravitate toward Abadar's order or Shelyn's artistic flair. More sinister communities uphold Asmodeus and other archdevils as common patrons. The dragon deities Apsu and Dahak are also common subjects of worship. Kobolds also often find themselves drawn to cults, particularly those with dragons or devils as figureheads.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Kobolds often adventure in pursuit of the power, lore, and treasure that they feel befit their disproportionately large egos. When adventurers, militias, or careless tyrants shatter a kobold community, the survivors often latch onto new families, seeking emotional solace—and sometimes revenge. Typical kobold backgrounds include artisan, artist, criminal, hunter, miner, scout, and tinker, plus bandit, cultist, scavenger, and servant. Kobolds excel as bards, rangers, rogues, and sorcerers, though they also often channel their ingenuity as alchemists or wizards.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>A young kobold's given name is rarely more than a syllable or two. However, as they age, achieve status, and accomplish great deeds, kobolds add more syllables to their names, imitating a common draconic practice. Kobolds rarely have surnames except in an effort to better fit into a community, in which case they typically adopt the surname of an inspiring figure in that group.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Azrnak, Draahzin, Enga, Fazgyn, Fazij, Jekkajak, Kib, Kirrok, Mirkol, Tarka, Urkak, Varshez, Vroklan, Zekstikah, Zgaz</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>PFS Note</strong> Due to years of successful Pathfinder Society activities, all characters have access to the kobold ancestry.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Kobold Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Constitution</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Draconic</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Patron</h2>\n<p>You weren't born with the power to cast spells, nor have you spent years in devotion to tomes, deities, or mystical secrets. Your power comes through a potent being that has chosen you as their vessel to carry forth some agenda in the world. This entity is typically mysterious and distant, revealing little of their identity and motivations, and they grant you spells and other magical powers through a familiar, which serves as a conduit for their power.</p>\n<p>A patron might be a deity or demigod, a coven of powerful hags, a fey lord, an archdevil, or a similarly powerful entity, or perhaps multiple such figures working in tandem. As you gain more of your patron's power, you might learn more about who or what they are-certain combinations of themes and lessons suggest particular patrons or agendas-but patrons empower witches for their own secretive reasons, which they rarely reveal in full.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, choose your patron's theme, which determines your spellcasting tradition, a skill, a special cantrip you gain, and a spell added to your familiar.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Familiar</h2>\n<p>Your patron has sent you a familiar, a mystical creature that teaches you and facilitates your spells. This familiar follows the basic rules for familiars, though as it's a direct conduit between you and your patron, it's more powerful than other familiars. Your familiar gains an extra familiar ability, and gains another extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.</p>\n<p>Your familiar is the source and repository of the spells your patron has bestowed upon you, and you must commune with your familiar to prepare your spells each day using your witch spellcasting (see below). Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-level spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron's theme. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any level you can cast, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.</p>\n<p>Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a scroll of that spell in a process that takes 1 hour. You can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Learn a Spell] exploration activity to prepare a special written version of a spell, which your familiar can consume as if it were a scroll. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron. You can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar.</p>\n<p>If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless. Your familiar's death doesn't affect any spells you have already prepared.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Witch Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Using your familiar as a conduit, your patron provides you the power to cast spells. You can cast spells using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Cast a Spell] activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells your familiar knows. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a witch, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, as shown in Table 2-7: Witch Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a witch. For example, as a 1st-level witch, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level witch, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The patron conduit class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Hexes</h2>\n<p>Your patron and familiar teach you special spells called hexes. A hex is a short-term effect drawn directly from your patron's magic. As such, you can cast only one hex each turn; attempts to cast a second hex spell on that turn fail and the spellcasting actions are lost.</p>\n<p>Hexes are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Refocus] activity to commune with your familiar.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>You learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Phase Familiar]</em> hex, which you can cast as a reaction to protect your familiar from harm. You learn most other hexes from witch lessons.</p>\n<p><strong>Hex Cantrips</strong></p>\n<p>Hex cantrips are special hexes that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still cast only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with your witch spellcasting and aren't counted toward your prepared cantrips. Your hex cantrips are determined by your patron theme.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Witch Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a witch class feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast, helping you to avoid danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Alertness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Through sheer experience, you've improved your technique with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Defensive Robes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>The flow of magic through your spellcasting and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You've achieved mastery over your patron's magic. Your proficiency ranks for spell attacks and spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Communion with your familiar has steeled your mental fortitude. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You've perfected your command of the magic your patron provides. Your proficiency ranks for spell attacks and spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Patron's Gift<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your patron grants you the power to command incredible works of magic. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, these spell slots can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Patron's Truth] feat to gain a second slot.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Patron Themes</h2>\n<p>Each patron has a theme, regardless of their nature or identity. This theme describes the forces over which the patron grants a witch influence. Some patrons are multifaceted, granting different themes and teaching different lessons to different witches. Your patron's theme determines the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell List</strong> You use this magical tradition and spell list.</li>\n<li><strong>Patron Skill</strong> You become trained in the listed skill.</li>\n<li><strong>Hex Cantrip</strong> You gain this special hex cantrip.</li>\n<li><strong>Granted Spell</strong> Your familiar automatically learns the spell listed here, in addition to those you gain through witch spellcasting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Baba Yaga Patron]</strong></p>\n<p>Baba Yaga teaches you how to transfer spirits into objects and freeze your foes. A witch with Baba Yaga as their patron can choose an inanimate object as a familiar. If they do, they still can gain master abilities and some familiar abilities that don't require movement. The object familiar has no Speeds and must select a Speed familiar ability before it can move, coming to life in a way appropriate to the chosen Speed and using the statistics of a normal familiar for that day.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell List</strong> occult</li>\n<li><strong>Patron Skill</strong> Occultism</li>\n<li><strong>Hex Cantrip</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Spirit Object]</em></li>\n<li><strong>Granted Spell</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Chilling Spray]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Curse Patron]</strong></p>\n<p>Foiling foes and undermining those who stand in your way are the tools of the curse patrons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell List</strong> occult</li>\n<li><strong>Patron Skill</strong> Occultism</li>\n<li><strong>Hex Cantrip</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Evil Eye]</em></li>\n<li><strong>Granted Spell</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ray of Enfeeblement]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Fate Patron]</strong></p>\n<p>Through your patron, you gain glimpses of the future and insight into the ever-woven tapestry of time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell List</strong> occult</li>\n<li><strong>Patron Skill</strong> Occultism</li>\n<li><strong>Hex Cantrip</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Nudge Fate]</em></li>\n<li><strong>Granted Spell</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.True Strike]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Fervor Patron]</strong></p>\n<p>Your patron represents a grand ideal or goal, granting you magic to further their mission and bring others to the cause.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell List</strong> divine</li>\n<li><strong>Patron Skill</strong> Religion</li>\n<li><strong>Hex Cantrip</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Stoke the Heart]</em></li>\n<li><strong>Granted Spell</strong> <em>Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Command]{Command}</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Night Patron]</strong></p>\n<p>Your patron speaks from the shadows, granting you power over darkness and dreams.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell List</strong> occult</li>\n<li><strong>Patron Skill</strong> Occultism</li>\n<li><strong>Hex Cantrip</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Shroud of Night]</em></li>\n<li><strong>Granted Spell</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Sleep]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Rune Patron]</strong></p>\n<p>Your patron is one of sigils and symbols, tomes and texts, words and wisdom.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell List</strong> arcane</li>\n<li><strong>Patron Skill</strong> Arcana</li>\n<li><strong>Hex Cantrip</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Discern Secrets]</em></li>\n<li><strong>Granted Spell</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Magic Weapon]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Wild Patron]</strong></p>\n<p>The wild places of the world feel the touch of your patron.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell List</strong> primal</li>\n<li><strong>Patron Skill</strong> Nature</li>\n<li><strong>Hex Cantrip</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wilding Word]</em></li>\n<li><strong>Granted Spell</strong> your choice of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Summon Animal]</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Summon Plant or Fungus]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Winter Patron]</strong></p>\n<p>Your patron reflects the frozen reaches of the world, bitterly cruel to those who underestimate that power.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell List</strong> primal</li>\n<li><strong>Patron Skill</strong> Nature</li>\n<li><strong>Hex Cantrip</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Clinging Ice]</em></li>\n<li><strong>Granted Spell</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Gust of Wind]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Witch Lessons</h2>\n<p>A witch's knowledge from their patron comes in the form of lessons, which you can learn by selecting feats like Basic Lesson.

This familiar follows the normal familiar rules, though as it's a direct conduit between you and your patron, it's more powerful than other familiars. Your familiar gains an extra familiar ability, and gains another extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.</p>\n<p>Your familiar is the source and repository of the spells your patron has bestowed upon you, and you must commune with your familiar to prepare your spells each day using your witch spellcasting (see below). Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-level spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron's theme. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any level you can cast, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.</p>\n<p>Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a scroll of that spell in a process that takes 1 hour. You can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Learn a Spell] exploration activity to prepare a special written version of a spell, which your familiar can consume as if it were a scroll. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron. You can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar.</p>\n<p>If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless. Your familiar's death doesn't affect any spells you have already prepared.</p>"

Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a witch, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a witch.

Casting a Spell is a special activity that takes a variable number of actions depending on the spell, as listed in each spell's stat block. As soon as the spellcasting actions are complete, the spell effect occurs.</p>\n<p>Some spells are cast as a reaction or free action. In those cases, you Cast the Spell as a reaction or free action (as appropriate) instead of as an activity. Such cases will be noted in the spell's stat block-for example, \"[reaction] verbal.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Long Casting</strong> Times Some spells take minutes or hours to cast. The Cast a Spell activity for these spells includes a mix of the listed spell components, but it's not necessary to break down which one you're providing at a given time. You can't use other actions or reactions while casting such a spell, though at the GM's discretion, you might be able to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take a long time, these spells have the exploration trait, and you can't cast them in an encounter. If combat breaks out while you're casting one, your spell is disrupted.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Components</strong> Each spell lists the spell components required to cast it after the action icons or text, such as \"[three-actions] material, somatic, verbal.\" The spell components, described in detail below, add traits and requirements to the Cast a Spell activity. If you can't provide the components, you fail to Cast the Spell.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Material (manipulate)</li>\n<li>Somatic (manipulate)</li>\n<li>Verbal (concentrate)</li>\n<li>Focus (manipulate)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disrupted and Lost Spells</strong> Some abilities and spells can disrupt a spell, causing it to have no effect and be lost. When you lose a spell, you've already expended the spell slot, spent the spell's costs and actions, and used the Cast a Spell activity. If a spell is disrupted during a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sustain a Spell] action, the spell immediately ends.</p>"
