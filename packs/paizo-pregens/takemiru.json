                    "value": "<p><em>Kitsune are a charismatic and witty people with a connection to the spiritual that grants them many magical abilities, chiefly the power to shapechange into other forms. Whether they pass unseen among other peoples or hold their tails high, kitsune are clever observers of the societies around them.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Kitsune are shapechangers with two forms: one of a fox-headed humanoid and one largely depending on where they were raised. Those raised in populated areas typically have what's called a tailless form—a humanoid body without any fox features that resembles a more common ancestry, such as an elf or a human. In wooded or rural areas, their second form is more likely to be that of a fox.</p>\n<p>Though all-kitsune settlements exist, most live among people of other ancestries, granting them a degree of external insight into social rules or dynamics that others process only subconsciously. Kitsune enjoy subverting expectations as much as they do going along with them. Their fondness for jokes, stories, and wordplay, especially when the twist of a riddle hinges on the listener's assumptions, reinforces their reputation as tricksters.</p>\n<p>With dual forms and a connection to both the material and spiritual worlds, kitsune have diverse concepts of self and identity. Some even view their forms as separate individuals altogether, using them to explore different aspects of their personality.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character with innate magical talents and countless hidden facets, each revealed with a glint of the eye and a twisting grin, you should play a kitsune.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Studiously observe the habits of those around you, taking mental notes on how to imitate them better.</li>\n<li>Delight in jokes, clever wordplay, pranks, or unnecessarily complex plots.</li>\n<li>Present a different, but authentic, side of yourself in each new situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are taken in by your magnetic personality and enigmatic nature.</li>\n<li>Marvel at your many supernatural abilities.</li>\n<li>Wonder what you aren't telling them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kitsune have alert vulpine ears, pointed snouts, and short, semi-retractable claws on their fingers and toes. Their fur is dense, countershaded, and most often red,tan, black, or white in color. Kitsune have bushy tails that grow in number as they hone their innate magical abilities, to as many as nine.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Kitsune are rarely the majority in whatever communities they inhabit, and many go their whole lives without meeting another kitsune beyond their family. Their society, as much as it exists, centers primarily around the commonalities that kitsune find as they pass among other peoples. The same social perspective that helps them imitate others also makes them quick to notice signs that someone may need help or a kind word. Due to this, kitsune often form strong interpersonal relationships and tend to anchor their social circles.</p>\n<p>When two kitsune do meet, they may find themselves exchanging light verbal repartee, enjoying the sport of trying to outwit each other. While it's considered a grave offense to outright give away another kitsune's shapechanging nature, kitsune relish surreptitiously forcing another to \"break character,\" shocking the other into disrupting their transformation through a well-placed comment.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Kitsune often have neutrality in their alignment from balancing their dual natures, though their instinct for stirring up trouble leads many to lean slightly toward chaos. Some possess the ability to control or bend the will of others, but even among those that do, only the evilest use these arts flippantly or selfishly.</p>\n<p>The patron kitsune deity is Daikitsu, the goddess of crafting and agriculture. Though not all kitsune necessarily worship Daikitsu, most respect her as the purported source of their powers. Kitsune in Tian Xia often revere both Shizuru and Tsukiyo, seeing the duality of the sun and moon in their own multifaceted nature. A small sect of Avistani kitsune worship Sivanah, the goddess of illusion, respecting her position between perception and reality and believing the goddess's true form to be that of a kitsune-hidden behind not seven veils, but nine.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>While kitsune have some traditional names, they're more likely to use names that are unremarkable in their local society, the better to pass unnoticed. Some have different names for each form: a kitsune name for their kitsune form, a regional name for a tailless form, and possibly no name at all for a fox form.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Hamako, Haohiko, Kitsukou, Kon, Kwan-la, Talaro</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Kitsune Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

You also ignore the penalty for making ranged attacks within your second range increment against the prey you're hunting.</p>\n<p>You can have only one creature designated as your prey at a time. If you use Hunt Prey against a creature when you already have a creature designated, the prior creature loses the designation and the new prey gains the designation. Your designation lasts until your next daily preparations.</p>\n<h2>Hunter's Edge</h2>\n<p>You have trained for countless hours to become a more skilled hunter and tracker, gaining an additional benefit when you Hunt Prey depending on the focus of your training.

Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores.

Your proficiency ranks for simple, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all such weapons and unarmed attacks when attacking your hunted prey.</p>\n<h2>Trackless Step<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>When you move through natural terrains, you are difficult to track.

Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventuring, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Nature's Edge<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You always find the weak points in your foes' defenses when they're on unfavorable terrain. Enemies are flat-footed to you if they're in natural difficult terrain or in difficult terrain resulting from a snare.</p>\n<h2>Ranger Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've practiced your techniques to make them harder to resist.

You can ignore the effects of non-magical difficult terrain. As normal for ignoring difficult terrain, this also lets you treat the hindrances of greater difficult terrain as those of difficult terrain.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Improved Evasion<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your ability to elude danger is matchless. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Incredible Senses<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You notice things almost impossible for an ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Masterful Hunter<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your abilities as a hunter to incredible levels. Your proficiency rank for your ranger class DC increases to master. When using a ranged weapon that you have master proficiency in, you can ignore the penalty if attacking your hunted prey within the weapon's second and third range increments.</p>\n<p>If you have master proficiency in Perception, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Perception checks when you Seek your prey, and if you have master proficiency in Survival, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Survival checks when you Track your prey. You also gain an additional benefit depending on your hunter's edge.</p>\n<p>See specific hunter's edges for more information.</p>\n<h2>Second Skin<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your armor has become akin to a second skin for you. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to master. When wearing light or medium armor, you can rest normally, rather than receiving poor rest that leaves you fatigued.</p>\n<h2>Swift Prey<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You size up your prey with only a glance. You can use Hunt Prey as a free action if it's your first action of your turn.</p>"

                "appearance": "<p>Takemiru's family hails from the Forest of Spirits on the other side of the world from Korvosa but traveled to Avistan through the frozen Path of Aganhei as part of a merchant caravan in hopes of making their fortune through trading. As he grew older, though, Takemiru realized his family members weren't the kind merchants they'd posed as but were part of a bandit crew that used mercantilism as a cover for their crimes. He abandoned his family and headed south, taking on the solo life of a wilderness hunter, eventually finding his way to the Korvosan hinterlands-and new friends. After spending so long alone in the wilds, he's grown quite fond of his new family. Someday he hopes to bring them back to Tian Xia to show them his homeland, but he's in no rush to return quite yet.</p>\n<p>Takemiru appears as a muscular, fox-like humanoid with red and white fur and bright blue eyes. His choice of weapons remains a playful vex to those who don't know him. Like the three-tined trident and sai he wields, he possesses three long fox tails. The fur on each tail lightens to white at the tip, and occasionally little wisps of smoke waft from the fur at the tip of his central tail as if it were on the verge of catching fire.</p>",
