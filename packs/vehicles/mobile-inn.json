Essentially a tiny inn on wheels, powered by alchemical catalysts and a steam engine, the vehicle is equipped with a stove, storage cupboard, washbasin, table, two benches, and a compact sleeping loft large enough to accommodate four. It can be modified to accommodate a single passenger in significantly more comfort or to easily hold 5 passengers by stripping the accommodations.</p>",
