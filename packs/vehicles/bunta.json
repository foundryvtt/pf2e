You arrive in a destination you specify, or a random location if you don't have a choice. If <em>Bunta</em> ever does not travel at least its Speed in a round, you can disrupt this activation. If you continue, you have a 1% cumulative chance of ending up in a random extraplanar location for each round that <em>Bunt</em>a did not travel at least its Speed, to a maximum of a 60% chance if <em>Bunta</em> didn't travel at least its Speed for the full 10 minutes. As long as you remain on <em>Bunta</em>, you are protected from any harmful effects of the plane's environment.</p>"

They can exit your soul, or you can remove any number of them using a single action—which has the concentrate trait—causing them to appear in a space adjacent to Bunta. If you leave Bunta or are killed, any creatures in your soul immediately exit your body into the nearest available space. If you leave Bunta after piloting it, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to store the boat in your soul. You can remove it from your soul into an adjacent square with another such action. If Bunta takes enough damage to destroy it, it bursts into golden mist, then reforms over 24 hours in its last pilot's soul.</p>",
