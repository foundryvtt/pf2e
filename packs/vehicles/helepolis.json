The tiers are specifically meant to be protective and give those within the helepolis greater cover (or standard cover if the helepolis is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Broken]). A massive ladder runs diagonally through the center of the helepolis, from the front of the top tier to the rear of the bottom tier.

If you want a more expensive siege weapon, you must Craft it separately. Because of the helepolis's structure, any siege weapon in it must launch its payload straight ahead. For instance, a ballista or springald could function in a helepolis, but not a catapult or trebuchet. Passengers of the helepolis can crew these siege weapons.</p>"
