If you want a more expensive siege weapon, you must Craft it separately. Because of the helepolis's structure, any siege weapon in it must launch its payload straight ahead. For instance, a ballista or springald could function in a helepolis, but not a catapult or trebuchet. Passengers of the helepolis can crew these siege weapons.</p>"
