The globster is often mistaken for such, and this assumption isn't entirely incorrect-these mindless oozing masses are composed of decaying sea creatures, half-digested and merged into a revolting, reeking heap of blubbery sludge.</p>\n<p>Though mindless, globsters are predators that seek out living quarry. They often huddle on the seafloor, where their own fetid mass attracts scavengers who swiftly become the ooze's next meal. When the tides wash these monsters ashore, they simply shift to hunting land-bound prey. Coastal communities usually notice the smell of a washed-up globster long before they see it. Those sent to investigate often mistake a globster for the carcass of a beached whale before getting too close and discovering the presumed corpse is very much alive and hungry.</p>\n<p>Sages once believed globsters were undead, undulating wads of rotting flesh driven to feed, but though mindless, they are very much alive. They are attracted to waterside refuse dumps and floating garbage scows and dimly aware enough to congregate where food is plentiful.</p>\n<p>Globsters consume living creatures but digest only a portion of them. The undigested dross accumulates within the globster as it becomes more and more bloated. They carry this fetid mass within their quelching bodies until instinct or injury provokes them to vomit forth a new globster to help devour everything nearby. A globster with enough dross to create a new globster automatically does so as a free action triggered upon taking damage. Treat any encounter with such a globster as though it were against two level 5 creatures, instead of just one. As far as scholars know, this is the only way these creatures can create more of their kind.</p>",
