The time before the mark fades increases depending on your heightened level.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> The sigil instead fades after 1 month.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> The sigil instead fades after 1 year.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> The sigil never fades.</p>"

They can shift from the form of a fox-headed humanoid into a specific alternate form unique to each kitsune, usually either a tailless form-such as a humanoid body without any fox features (typically of the prevalent ancestry where they grew up)-or a fox form. Kitsune revel in joy and beauty, often practicing storytelling, dance, and other creative arts. However, they also have a penchant for playing pranks on the joyless and self-important, earning them a reputation as tricksters. Favored by the goddess Daikitsu, kitsune seem to be almost supernaturally lucky, perpetually dodging danger by the narrowest margins.</p>\n<p>While kitsune settlements do exist, most kitsune are incredibly curious and often leave home at a young age to encounter new people and sights. Some kitsune spend years in their tailless form, living disguised among humanoids in urban or rural societies whose inhabitants have no clue of their true nature. Others go to the opposite extreme, spending most of their lives in the form of a fox, only to reveal themselves at the most opportune moment. For many kitsune, revealing their true form to someone is a sign of great trust, but it's also not uncommon for kitsune to display their dual nature openly.</p>\n<p>Kitsune's connection to the spiritual world grants them a number of magical abilities.
