Magic also flows through this conduit from your eidolon into you, so your eidolon determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose from (as described in Summoner Spellcasting on page 54).</p>\n<p>Choose a type of eidolon from the options starting on page 59 and other eidolons you have access to. When you choose your eidolon, you also determine its appearance and general form, within the parameters for that particular type of eidolon. Once you establish your eidolon's type and general appearance, these features can't be changed later, except by selecting special evolution feats that can cause your eidolon to develop new features.</p>\n<p>Your magical connection with your eidolon takes the form of a sigil on each of your bodies. As long as your eidolon is manifested, the sigil glows with light and can't be covered or disguised via any means; it will shine through clothing, appear over cloaks, and remain unaffected by obfuscating magic. This, combined with the way that the two of you clearly act in tandem, makes it readily apparent to an intelligent observer that the two of you are connected in some way, even if the person has never encountered a summoner before.</p>\n<p>You bring your eidolon into reality with the Manifest Eidolon action.</p>\n<p>Your eidolon is no mere minion. It doesn't have the minion or summoned trait, and the two of you work together and coordinate your actions. You and your eidolon share your actions and multiple attack penalty. Each round, you can use any of your actions (including reactions and free actions) for yourself or your eidolon.</p>\n<p>You coordinate your actions with your eidolon more efficiently when you Act Together. Your connection with your eidolon allows you to communicate with it telepathically at all times, even when it isn't manifested. You also gain the Share Senses action.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the connection between you and your eidolon means you both share a single pool of Hit Points. Damage taken by either you or the eidolon reduces your Hit Points, while healing either of you recovers your Hit Points. Like with your actions, if you and your eidolon are both subject to the same effect that affects your Hit Points, you apply those effects only once (applying the greater effect, if applicable). For instance, if you and your eidolon get caught in an area effect that would heal or damage you both, only the greater amount of healing or damage applies.</p>\n<h3>Gear and your Eidolon</h3>\n<p>Your eidolon can't wear or use magic items, except for items with the eidolon trait. An eidolon can have up to two items invested. Your eidolon's link to you means it can benefit from certain magic items invested by you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your eidolon gains item bonuses to Perception and skills from any magical items that you have invested.</li>\n<li>Your eidolon increases its item bonus to AC based on your armor's armor potency rune or bracers of armor. It also gains an item bonus to its saves from the resilient rune on your armor or from your bracers of armor. Other permanent items that grant or increase item bonuses to AC and saves might convey a similar benefit, as determined by the GM.</li>\n<li>Your eidolon's Strikes benefit from the fundamental and property runes on your handwraps of mighty blows. Alternatively, you can Invest a magic weapon (even though magic weapons can't normally be Invested) to share its fundamental and property runes with your eidolon. You share these benefits only while you're holding the weapon, and you can have no more than one weapon invested in this way at a time. In either case, the eidolon gains only the benefits that can apply to its attacks, with the same limitations noted in handwraps of mighty blows.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lost and Altered Actions</h3>\n<p>If you or your eidolon becomes slowed, stunned, quickened, or otherwise affected by something that changes the actions you gain at the start of each turn, it affects your shared actions. However, if you are both subject to such an effect, apply only the more severe one. For instance, if you or your eidolon were @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 1}, you would start your turn with one fewer action, but if you were both slowed 1, you would still lose only one action, rather than adding the two slowed effects together. However, if you were slowed 1 and your eidolon @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 2}, you'd have two fewer actions, because that's the more severe effect. If only one of you becomes restricted in how you can spend your actions, that restriction doesn't automatically extend to the other; for example, if your eidolon became @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] or petrified, it wouldn't be able to move, but you could still use your actions to move. The GM resolves any situation that's unclear.</p>\n<p>You, as the player, control both your summoner and your eidolon, and the two are generally considered to cooperate unless you decide for them not to. While a summoner's link with an eidolon is a partnership, ultimately the eidolon is linked to you, not the other way around. If there's ever a conflict of who should act, you win out over your eidolon. This means that if the eidolon comes under an effect that would take its actions out of your control, such as the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Confused] or controlled condition, you can use all of your shared actions so your eidolon doesn't have any actions remaining to cause trouble (as long as you are able to act). However, if you came under such an effect, you would simply use all of your shared actions, preventing your eidolon from acting.</p>\n<h2>Summoner Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your link to your eidolon grants you limited magic connected to your eidolon's nature. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because of the magic you draw from your eidolon, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need a material component pouch.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell and five cantrips. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a summoner, the magical link with your eidolon grants you additional, more powerful spell slots. Your total number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast are shown in Table 2-4: Summoner Spells per Day. Because of the way you draw magic from your connection to your eidolon, you begin to lose lower-level spell slots once you reach 5th level. The maximum number of spell slots you get from the summoner class is four, starting when you reach 4th level.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447 of the Core Rulebook.</p>\n<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>\n<p>When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a summoner. For example, as a 1st-level summoner, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level summoner, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<h3>Spell Repertoire</h3>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your eidolon, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it doesn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2-4: Summoner Spells per Day), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell. At 3rd level, you add the first 2nd-level spell to your repertoire. At 4th level you gain your second and your spell repertoire reaches its maximum size of five spells.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, in addition to adding two 3rd-level spells to your repertoire, you lose your lowest level of spell slots. Any time you lose a level of spell slots, you lose two spells in your repertoire as well. These can come from spells you already know or out of the number of new spells you're learning. On levels in which you don't change your spell slots, you can swap out multiple spells, as described below.</p>\n<h3>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. If it's a level at which you lose a set of lower-level slots, you can replace the two in either order. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<p>At 6th level and every even level thereafter, you can swap out any number of your spells for different spells of a level you can cast. When you do, you must keep at least one spell you can cast with your lowest level of spell slots so you don't end up with slots you can't use. For instance, at 6th level you would need to keep at least one 2nd-level spell, but all your other spells could be 3rd level.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Link Spells</h2>\n<p>Your connection to your eidolon allows you to cast link spells, special spells that have been forged through your shared connection with your eidolon. Link spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to specifically connect with your eidolon, such as by having a heart-to-heart conversation, playing together, or meditating in unison on the nature of your bond.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear on page 300 of the Core Rulebook.</p>\n<p>You learn the evolution surge link spell, which allows you to grant your eidolon one of several useful benefits.</p>\n<h3>Link Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Link cantrips are special link spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like. Link cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from your tradition's spell list. Generally, only feats can give you more link cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out link cantrips gained from summoner feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining.</p>\n<p>You learn the boost eidolon link cantrip, which briefly improves your eidolon's capabilities, allowing it to attack with greater power.</p>\n<h2>Evolution Feat</h2>\n<p>Evolution feats are a special type of summoner class feat that allow you to customize your eidolon through your shared link. You gain an evolution feat for your eidolon at 1st level, representing the differences that make it unique from other eidolons of its type. If you retrain this feat, the feat you replace it with must also be an evolution feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Summoner Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a summoner class feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Shared Vigilance<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You and your eidolon work together to remain alert to threats around you, allowing you to perceive far more together than you could individually. Your proficiency rank in Perception and your eidolon's proficiency rank in Perception increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Unlimited Signature Spells<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>All of your spells are signature spells. That means that if you know a spell, you can heighten it freely by casting it from a higher-level spell slot, up to the maximum level of spell you can cast. You can similarly cast any of its lower-level versions without learning them separately.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, boost four different ability scores. You can use these boosts to increase ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<p>Your eidolon also gets four ability boosts at these levels. The eidolon's ability boosts follow the same rules as yours.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Eidolon Unarmed Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Your eidolon becomes more capable of using its unarmed attacks. Its proficiency rank for unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Eidolon Symbiosis<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your connection with your eidolon strengthens, granting your eidolon access to a new ability depending on its type, as described in Eidolon Abilities in each eidolon's entry.</p>\n<h2>Eidolon Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your eidolon has learned how to inflict greater injuries with its unarmed attacks. It deals 2 additional damage with unarmed attacks in which it's an expert. This damage increases to 3 if it's a master, and 4 if it's legendary.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>As your connection to your eidolon deepens, the power of your spells increases. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your eidolon's tradition increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Shared Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You and your eidolon boost each other's reflexes, allowing you both to roll away from danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves and your eidolon's proficiency rank for Reflex saves increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Eidolon Defensive Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your eidolon increases its ability to avoid attacks. Its proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Simple Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Training and magic improved your weapon technique.
