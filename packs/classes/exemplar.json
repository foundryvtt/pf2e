Whether you were directly touched by this power, claimed it from an ancient being or artifact, or whether it awoke something long dormant in your lineage, a spark of the divine now blazes within your soul, granting you abilities, sacred weapons, and divine signifiers that reach into the realm previously reserved for gods and legends. How you wield these tools and grow your power is for you to decideâ€”you may become a hero or you may turn to selfish ends, but one thing is certain: you intend to carve your epithet in history, immortalized in the memory of gods and mortals alike.</em></p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.kzxu2dI7tFxv6Ix6.JournalEntryPage.CIQggvnSfmuLa7eH]{Exemplar}</p>"
