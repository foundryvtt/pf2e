you get a partial boost, and you must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Kinetic Gate</h2>\n<p>As a kineticist, you've awakened or opened a kinetic gate, a supernatural conduit within your body that can channel elemental forces straight from the elemental planes. You can choose either a single gate (one element) or dual gate (two elements) at 1st level.</p>\n<p>When selecting an element for your kinetic gate, you can pick from six elements - air, earth, fire metal, water, and wood. Elements you can channel are referred to as your kinetic elements. Your kinetic elements function even in environments where they normally wouldn't. For example, you could use fire actions underwater even though that's normally not possible, and you could create air in a vacuum.</p>\n<p>Your kinetic gate gives you impulse feats, magical actions that let you shape and control your elements in awesome ways. You can select more impulse feats using your kineticist class feats, as described under Impulses. At higher levels, the gate's threshold class feature gives you more impulse feats and lets you choose whether to improve with one element or access new kinetic elements.</p>\n<h3><strong>Single Gate</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic gate links to a single elemental plane, starting you with a single element but giving you greater power with it. Choose one element to be your kinetic element, and select two 1st-level impulse feats that have that element's trait.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain an impulse junction, a benefit that occurs when you use an impulse of the chosen element that takes 2 actions or more. This happens before the other effects of the impulse, unless noted otherwise. You can gain only one impulse junction per round; they are described in full below.</p>\n<p><strong>Air</strong> Before or after the other effects of the impulse, you can either Stride up to half your Speed or Step. If you have a fly Speed, you can Fly up to half your fly Speed instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Earth</strong> Fragments of stone float around you, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Fire</strong> Increase the damage die size of fire damage dealt by the impulse by one step.</p>\n<p><strong>Metal</strong> Choose acid, electricity, or piercing. Until the start of your next turn, each time a creature touches you or damages you with an unarmed melee attack or nonreach melee weapon, it takes damage of the chosen type equal to half your level (minimum 1 damage).</p>\n<p><strong>Water</strong> After the impulse's other effects, you can move one creature targeted by the impulse or in its area 5 feet in any direction, or 10 feet if it's in a body of water. This can't move the creature into the air. You can choose only a creature that's willing to be moved, that failed its save against the impulse, or that you succeeded at an impulse attack roll against.</p>\n<p><strong>Wood</strong> You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level that last until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3><strong>Dual Gate</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic gate is a harmonious conduit between two planes, allowing you to combine their elements to give you a versatile set of abilities. Select two elements to be your kinetic elements. Then, select two 1st-level impulse feats, one with the trait of the first element and one with the trait of the other.</p>\n<h2>Kinetic Aura</h2>\n<p>Through your kinetic gate, elements flow from an elemental plane to orbit your person. The form and appearance of this kinetic aura are unique to you. Examples include a chaotic wind orbiting the body, fragments of floating gravel, colorful wicks of flame stars of raw metal always changing shape, floatin snowflakes or splinters dancing in the air. If you can channel more than one element, pieces of all your kinetic elements appear in the aura.</p>\n<p>You have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Channel Elements] action, which lets you activate your kinetic aura.</p>\n<h2>Impulses</h2>\n<p>An impulse is a special type of magical action available to kineticists, allowing them to wield or shape their element into diverse and powerful forms. To wield an element, you must have your kinetic aura active and have a free hand, as described in the impulse trait. You automatically gain the Elemental Blast and Base Kinesis impulses, and your kinetic gate selection gives you additional impulse feats. You can select more impulse feats with kineticist class feats, and at higher levels, you'll automatically get more with the gate's threshold class feature. You can select an impulse feat only if it matches one of your kinetic elements.</p>\n<p>Impulses are magical, and though they aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect impulses. Abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells) also apply to impulses.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Levels</strong></h3>\n<p>Any impulse you use is the same level you are. For instance, if you're 5th level, your Elemental Blast would be 5th level (and its counteract rank would be 3rd rank), even though you gained the action at 1st level.</p>\n<p>Similar to spells, many impulses get more powerful as you increase in level. In these cases, the impulse ends with one or more \"Level\" entries. This either lists the levels at which the impulse gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level impulse with a \"Level (+4)\" entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Attacks and DCs</strong></h3>\n<p>An impulse that requires a saving throw uses your kineticist class DC. Some of your impulses require you to attempt an <strong>impulse attack roll</strong> to see how effective they are. Your impulse attack roll uses the same proficiency and attribute modifier as your kineticist class DC. Like a spell attack modifier, your impulse attack modifier uses the following formula: d20 roll + attribute modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. This means your impulse attack roll is typically 10 lower than your class DC. The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained] condition can reduce your impulse attack rolls and class DCs. You can acquire a <em>gate attenuator</em> to gain a bonus to your impulse attack modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Elemental Blast</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Elemental Blast] impulse is a simple expression of your power, allowing you to attack with the pure matter of your kinetic element. Though each element has its own strengths and weaknesses, the basic principles to using them are the same. You can customize the appearance of your Elemental Blast and can even choose a different form each time you use the impulse.</p>\n<h3><strong>Base Kinesis</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Base Kinesis] impulse lets you perform simple alterations to an element.</p>\n<h2>Kineticist Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a kineticist class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Extract Element<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Creatures with a strong tie to your element might be troublesome for you to deal with, at least until you've learned to turn their elemental nature to your advantage. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Extract Element] action.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Will Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Your mental defenses grow stronger. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Gate's Threshold<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You reach a new milestone in your odyssey to become in tune with your kinetic gate and must decide how to expand the gate's power. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you choose to either expand the portal or fork the path.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Expand the Portal</strong>: Your gate attunes more precisely to one of your elements. Gain an impulse feat of your level or lower for one of your kinetic elements; if you have more than one element, you can choose a composite impulse. You also gain a gate junction for one of your kinetic elements. If you have no valid options for the feat-typically because you have one kinetic element and devoted your class feats to gaining that element's impulses-you can instead select any kineticist class feat of your level or lower for which you meet the prerequisites.</li>\n<li><strong>Fork the Path</strong>: Your gate reaches to another elemental plane. Add a new element of your choice to your kinetic elements. Gain an impulse feat of your level or lower with the trait of that element. You can't select a composite impulse feat with this feat selection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Gate Junctions</strong></h3>\n<p>When you gain a gate junction, you develop a specialized kinetic technique. Choose one benefit from the gate junction table for one of your kinetic elements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>critical blast</strong> junction happens when you get a critical success with an Elemental Blast of the kinetic element.</li>\n<li>An <strong>elemental resistance</strong> grants you resistance to damage while your kinetic aura is active. This resistance is equal to your level, and it applies to damage of any listed type or that comes from a creature or effect that has any of the listed traits. At 17th level, you gain immunity to effects with any of the listed traits. This doesn't make you immune to creatures with such a trait. You can voluntarily forgo this resistance, immunity, or both if you want an effect to work on you.</li>\n<li>You can choose an <strong>impulse junction</strong> instead of one of the listed junctions. Impulse junctions are listed under Single Gate.</li>\n<li>An <strong>aura junction</strong> adds an effect to your kinetic aura when you Channel Elements.</li>\n<li>A <strong>skill junction</strong> makes you trained in the listed skill and grants you the listed skill feat. If you were already trained in the listed skill, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. While your kinetic aura is active, you gain a +1 status bonus to the listed skill; the bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 17th level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can select each gate junction only once, unless noted otherwise, but you can have the same type of junction for multiple elements. You can always choose not to use a gate junction when it would normally occur. If you have multiple junctions that would apply at the same time - such as kinetic aura junctions for different elements - you can apply any number of them. (Though note that you can use only one impulse junction per round.)</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"margin-left:0px;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Air Gate Junction</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Critical Blast</strong> Push the target up to 10 feet.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Elemental Resistance</strong> air, electricity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Aura Junction</strong> You and any ally that starts its turn in the aura gets a +10-foot status bonus to land Speed until the end of that turn, and to fly Speed if applicable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Skill Junction</strong> Stealth, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Experienced Smuggler]</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Earth Gate Junction</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Critical Blast</strong> If the target is on the ground, it's knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone]; if it isn't on the ground, it descends up to 20 feet (you choose the distance).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Elemental Resistance</strong> earth, poison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Aura Junction</strong> Squares in the aura are difficult terrain fo your enemies, but only if moving into the square would make the enemy farther away from you.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Skill Junction</strong> Athletics, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Hefty Hauler]</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Fire Gate Junction</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Critical Blast</strong> The target takes @Damage[1d6[persistent,fire]] damage.

Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Reflow Elements<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You twist one of the impulses you've learned into a different but still similar magic. When you make your daily preparations, you can replace one of your impulse feats with a different impulse feat that has the same elemental trait. You can reflow only impulse feats that have exactly one elemental trait, not composite impulse feats or feats that vary by element. This follows the same rules as retraining; you can replace impulse feats gained through your class feats or through class features that grant you impulse feats.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've improved your combat skill. Your proficienc rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 damage if you're a master, and 4 damage if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Greater Kinetic Durability<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your gate protects you even more. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Fortitude save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Fortitude save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.</p>\n<h2>Kinetic Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The power flowing from you grows even difficult to resist. Your proficiency rank for your kineticist class DC increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Double Reflow<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your kinetic gate becomes even more adaptable. When you use reflow elements, you can replace two impulse feats instead of one.</p>\n<h2>Final Gate<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your kinetic gate reaches a perfect form, its power constantly fighting to be released. If your kinetic aura is inactive, you automatically use the first action of your turn to Channel Elements as a free action. You can deliberately suppress the effect. If you're unable to act, final gate still functions, but you don't get to use the Elemental Blast or stance impulse you normally do from using Channel Elements.</p>\n<h2>Kinetic Legend<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your elements become almost impossible to resist. Your proficiency rank for your kineticist class DC increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.</p>"
