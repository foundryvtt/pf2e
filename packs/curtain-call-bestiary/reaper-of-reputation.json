The most common <em>geas</em> to refrain from carrying out an act is a specification to avoid violating a contract. In those cases, the secondary caster usually takes charge of making sure the wording of the contract is attuned correctly with the ritual's magic. Because the target is willing, <em>geas</em> can have a duration that lasts for as long as the target agrees to. If the target is unable to fulfill the <em>geas</em>, it becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1}, and the sickened condition increases by 1 for each consecutive day it is prevented from following the <em>geas</em>, to a maximum of sickened 4. The sickened condition ends immediately when it follows the <em>geas</em> again; it can't remove the sickened condition in any other way. Only powerful magic such as a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wish] ritual can remove the effects of <em>geas</em> from a willing target.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The <em>geas</em> succeeds, and the target receives a +1 status bonus to skill checks that directly uphold the <em>geas</em> (at the GM's discretion).</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The <em>geas</em> succeeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The <em>geas</em> fails.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The <em>geas</em> fails, and you are instead affected by the <em>geas</em> you were attempting to place on the target.

If the target fails this Will save, the <em>geas</em> lasts up to 1 week.

            "publicNotes": "<p>Skelms crave power, and the palace skelms who stalk the halls where such power concentrates are among the most dangerous of their kind. They assume titles that allow them maximum freedom to punish or hurt others with minimal oversight: any vindictive guard captain, tyrannical viceroy, or needlessly cruel magistrate could be or become a palace skelm. They delight in the wealth and status of their positions, garbing themselves in ornate finery that reflects their station.</p>\n<p>Palace skelms ingratiate themselves with powerful individuals and gather followers by stoking fears of losing long-held or hard-earned power-especially power gained through illicit means. They undermine their enemies by encouraging competition, jealousy, and outright paranoia by way of magic and false messages. These skelms possess an unnatural ability to twist spoken words and worm their manipulative magic into others' speech, sowing confusion and hatred that might explode into violence.</p>\n<p>A political upheaval is a palace skelm's greatest fear and opportunity alike, upsetting the balance of power he has built but providing countless new opportunities to sow hatred and evil. This conflicting goal leads palace skelms to self-sabotage and undermine their own efforts more than any other skelm.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Rage-filled skelms are drawn to any settlement with more than a few hundred souls. Using magical disguises and leveraging societal norms to their benefit, these antlered monsters crave fearful respect and brutally punish any who dare disagree with their lofty opinions, even in the slightest degree. Although quite dangerous on their own, skelms are at their deadliest when leading an angry mob. Their cruel and exploitative nature has made their name synonymous with villainy.</p>\n<p>An existing skelm can transform any evil humanoid who's overwhelmed with rage into one of their kind. Skelms heap enraging humiliation on potential new brothers as a form of indoctrination, convincing these recruits that some other person or group is responsible for their misery. This practice ensures skelms begin their new existence with sufficient vitriol to plot their revenge.</p>\n<p>Many newly forged skelms carry on their lives in the roles they held as mortals; and in fact, these roles often shape the type of skelm they become. Skelms can arise among members of nearly any ancestry, though they're more common among cultures with deeply entrenched gender roles, unjust hierarchies, and those that don't offer healthy ways to experience and process anger.</p>",
