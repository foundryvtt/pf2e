The demons appear in pairs at the entrances to the alcoves to the left and right of the distortion circle's alcove, and they then roll initiative. The demons do not pursue foes from this room, and vanish if the trap resets or if the trap is disabled. The summoned demons can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures. The distortion circle then appears to open into a bloody toothy mouth and rolls initiative.</p>"
