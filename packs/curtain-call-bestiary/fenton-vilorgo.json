A creature that is unwilling to be teleported can attempt a Will save to resist the effect. If it remains in the circle, the creature must attempt this save again at the end of each of its turns.</p>\n<p>The circle normally works only in one direction, though you can double the cost to make it work in both directions.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You create the teleportation circle, and it's extremely precise, regardless of the distance traveled. Travelers arrive exactly at the designated point.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As a critical success, but the destination is off target by roughly 1 percent of the distance traveled, to a maximum of 10 miles off target.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The teleportation circle doesn't function.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The teleportation circle is wildly inaccurate. It leads to a random destination roughly the same distance from the origin point, and the chances of some other unusual mishap are much greater.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The cost is 2,000 gp, the duration is 1 month, and the destination can be anywhere on the same planet.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> The cost is 10,000 gp, the duration is unlimited, and the destination can be anywhere on the same planet</p>"
