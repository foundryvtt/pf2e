            "value": "<p>Granted by <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Insect Form]</em></p>\n<p>You envision a simple bug and transform into a Medium animal battle form. When you cast this spell, choose a form.</p>\n<p>You can decide the specific type of animal (such as such as a ladybug or scarab for beetle), but this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss this spell.</p>\n<p>You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.</li>\n<li>10 temporary Hit Points.</li>\n<li>Low-light vision.</li>\n<li>One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +13, and your damage bonus is +2. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled] condition). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.</li>\n<li>Athletics modifier of +13, unless your own is higher.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You also gain specific abilities based on the form you choose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mantis</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Speed 40 feet; imprecise scent 30 feet;</li>\n<li>Melee <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> foreleg, <strong>Damage</strong> 2d8 bludgeoning.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> Your battle form is Large, and your attacks have 10-foot reach. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. You instead gain 15 temporary HP, attack modifier +16, damage bonus +6, and Athletics +16.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> Your battle form is Huge, and your attacks have 15-foot reach. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. You instead gain 20 temporary HP, attack modifier +18, damage bonus +2 and double damage dice (including persistent damage), and Athletics +20.</p>"
