You become undetected to all creatures unless they can see invisible creatures. You Stride. At the end of your movement, if you have cover, greater cover, or concealment, attempt a Stealth check to Hide. You gain a +2 status bonus to this Stealth check. The invisibility then ends, and you either become observed or hidden to creatures as determined by your check to Hide, if you made one.</p>"
