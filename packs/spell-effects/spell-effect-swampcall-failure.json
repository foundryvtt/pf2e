The area becomes difficult terrain. Creatures in the area when you Cast this Spell must attempt a Reflex saving throw.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature sinks partially into the mud. The creature takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds (except for its swim Speed, if any) and becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard]. These effects last until the creature leaves the area or until the end of its next turn, whichever comes first.</p>"
