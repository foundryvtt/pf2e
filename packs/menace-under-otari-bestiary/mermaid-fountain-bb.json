Roll a [[/r 1d4]]{1d4} and count to the number you rolled, starting with the player on your left, to determine which hero gets attacked. The spray is a ranged Strike.</li>\n<li><strong>5-7 Corner Spray</strong> The statue spins about, firing a spray of water at each corner of the room that still has a functioning corner mechanism. This hits any creature adjacent to the corner mechanism, dealing [[/r 2d6[bludgeoning]]] damage. Each hero must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:15|basic:true|traits:hazard], taking no damage on a critical success, half damage on a success, full damage on a failure, and double damage on a critical failure.</li>\n<li><strong>8-9 Half Room</strong> The statue spins about, spraying half of the room with water. Roll any die. If the result is even, it sprays the west half; otherwise, it sprays the east half. This deals [[/r 2d6[bludgeoning]]] damage to each creature in that half of the room, and each hero must attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:15|basic:true|traits:hazard] save.</li>\n<li><strong>10 Full Room</strong> This works just like the half-room attack, but it targets everyone in the room.</li>\n</ul>",
