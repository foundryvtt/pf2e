Though similar to other vampiresâ€”they are undead, drain vital energy from the living, and can be slain only in specific waysâ€”jiang-shi feast upon the breath of the living, also known as qi or ki, instead of blood. While they possess unique powers, including their magic-deflecting paper fulus, extraordinary jumping ability, and immunity to sunlight, jiang-shi also possess unique vulnerabilities, such as the inability to see living creatures save through breathsense, a revulsion to bells and mirrors, and near-stupefying melancholia. Thankfully, most jiang-shi can't create vampiric spawn.</p>\n<p>Roused rudely from their nightmarish slumber, the provincial jiang-shi roams the villages and graveyards around their domain searching for sustenance to slake their hunger.</p>",
