These evil creatures can fully change into a giant spider or sprout spider legs from their backs, and they often keep giant spiders as pets. Jorogumo usually eat their prey, but some humanoids meet an even more gruesome fate as living incubators for jorogumo eggs. Though most jorogumos are solitary creatures, some have taken up worship of Norgorber and serve as valuable allies to thieves' guilds following that god's guise as the Gray Master.</p>",
