This blast fills a @Template[type:burst|distance:20] and inflicts @Damage[(4d10+18)[untyped]] damage to all creatures in the area (@Check[type:reflex|dc:25|basic:true] save). The type of damage is chosen by the GM from physical (bludgeoning or piercing), or from acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The description of how this explosion manifests should vary to match the type of damage inflicted, but should also draw from the triggering creature's past, as if memories of old wounds had suddenly come back with a vengeance. An explosive manifestation that deals piercing damage might be conveyed as a sudden blast of spikes radiating up out of the ground (stemming from a creature's memory of the time it fell into a spiked pit and almost died). One that deals fire damage might involve the sound of a dragon's roar as the air erupts into flames (coming from a creature's memory of being nearly incinerated by a dragon). A moment later, all evidence of the hazard's manifestation (save for the damage it causes to the creatures in its area) vanish.</p>"
