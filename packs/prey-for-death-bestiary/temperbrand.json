            "publicNotes": "<p>Temperbrand is a 14-foot-tall elemental with a shape reminiscent of a dwarf, but she appears to be made entirely from orange-and-white heated metal. Blades form and collapse on her skin, the metal folding over itself constantly as she moves and fights, but the swordlike lengths that replace her hands remain in place at all times. She fights with vicious gusto, slicing through foes as her limbs either transform into fiery blades or eject metal shrapnel from her body, propelled by pockets of steam and super-heated air. Temperbrand was created by Gorum as the embodiment of modern weapons and the potential of the forge to create any instrument of war.</p>\n<p>She is a merger of Forgeheart, a powerful fire elemental, and Slageater, a powerful metal elemental. Gorum had the two elementals fight side by side for 300 years before merging them into one entity.</p>\n<p>Temperbrand is often sent to bolster soldiers who are outmatched in an attempt to even the odds on the battlefield, making for a more spectacular war in Gorum's eyes. She might appear before a quartermaster and supply as many blades, shields, and suits of armor as they require, creating the armaments from her own body.</p><h2>Temperbrand's Corpse</h2><p>It hasn't happened yet to the powerful elemental, but if Temperbrand is slain, her body collapses swiftly in upon itself, transforming into a powerful magic maul. @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Temperbrand]</p><h2>Servitor Of The Divine</h2><p>All deities maintain favored agents to work their will among mortals. Heralds are among the most well-known of these agents—unique entities who serve as the deity's mouthpiece and messenger and are often sent in response to a mortal spellcaster requesting aid in the form of a planar servitor ritual. But a deity's herald isn't the only agent permitted to walk among worshippers or smite enemies of the faith. Those called servitors are unique, powerful, and stand among the deity's most devoted adherents.</p>\n<p>Servitors are quite powerful, yet they're not truly immortal. Any servitor of the divine may be slain in battle or through misadventure. In some cases, a slain servitor's body vanishes and is replaced by a powerful treasure. In others, the body itself simply crumples to the ground as a corpse. Servitors can be restored to life at a deity's whim, yet in many cases their deity won't immediately grant this resurrection and may simply seek to create or elevate an entirely different servitor. Should the unthinkable happen and a deity themselves perish, their existing servitors do not die but are immediately aware of the fact that their creator has ceased to be. Some myths tell of servitors who have then gone on to ascend in power and replace their creator as a demigod or even a deity themselves, while in other stories, a desperate servitor may seek out a new god or goddess to devote themselves to.</p>\n<p>While servitors are all unique creatures, in most cases they were once mortal worshippers—be they humanoid or otherwise—who have particularly pleased their deity. The resulting powers and abilities granted to the servitor vary wildly, but it's almost unheard of for a servitor of any deity to be less powerful than 15th level, or at least a few levels above what they possessed in their previous life. While there are not limits to the number of servitors a deity might keep, most gods traditionally keep no more than three.</p>\n<p>In Gorum's case, his three most well-known servitors are comprised of a demon, dragon, and an elemental, creatures who either embody the chaos of battle or the raw spirit of the forge. In each case, these unique servitors' worldview and philosophy closely match that of their Lord in Iron, leaving them outcasts or even pariahs among others of their kind. Yet to Bloody Hands, Saint Fang, and Temperbrand, there is no greater comfort in life than service to the god of war.</p>",
