But not for youâ€”usually! Whether you grew up near an enchanted wilderness, have visited the First World, frequently deal with nature spirits, or even were a fey foundling raised by otherworldly beings, you're well acquainted with fey, their myriad traditions, and their even more numerous tricks. Fey and the Wildwood Lodge aren't the same thing, yet there's enough overlap that you're sure to fit in at the upcoming Greenwood Gala.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Charisma</strong> or <strong>Dexterity</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Deception skill and the Fey Lore skill.
