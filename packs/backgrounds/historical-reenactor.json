Whether it's your hobby or career, you've developed a reputation for translating the past into the present through demonstrations, period performances, acting out famous events, donning replica armor, and other feats of living historyâ€”filling in a few historical blanks if it makes a better show. Having learned of your passion, Clan Tolorr has sponsored your visit to Highhelm so that you can learn from each other. It's a wonderful opportunity, and Tolorr puppetry arts, storytelling, props, and historical rigor are the stuff of legends. Already, you've begun researching dwarven history so that you're prepared for whatever lies ahead.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Strength</strong> or <strong>Charisma</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in either the Performance skill or the Society skill, and you're trained in the Dwarf Lore skill. If you selected Performance, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Impressive Performance] skill feat. If you chose Society, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Dubious Knowledge] skill feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection:</strong> Bulgra Veldollow, a matriarch in Clan Tolorr and accomplished puppeteer</p>\n<p><strong>Reputation Points:</strong> +0</p>"
