Whatever the case, you're a frequent pilgrim to archives and academies, and you seek patterns of cosmic proofs within volumes and tomes.</p>\n<p>Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to <strong>Constitution</strong> or <strong>Intelligence</strong>, and one is a free attribute boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in Occultism. You're also trained in the Library Lore skill or a Lore skill associated with your school. You gain the Additional Lore skill feat.</p>"
