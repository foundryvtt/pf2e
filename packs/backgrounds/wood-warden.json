Perhaps you grew up in a community that revered and carefully managed its local ecosystem, learning millennia-old traditions. It could be you were an unlikely survivor who learned to live off the land out of necessity, gradually becoming its protector. Whatever the case, traveling to the Greenwood Gala is a great opportunity to share your knowledge, learn new tricks, and recruit allies who can help defend your home.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Strength</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Survival skill and the Scouting Lore skill.
