Unlike a through-and-through charlatan, there's some real occult methodology behind your flimflam, but that's likely cold comfort to the people you swindle. Whether you decided to take a more righteous path, were caught and pledged to make it right, or still slip in a few \"séances\" between adventures, you've taken to an adventuring lifestyle as you move from place to place.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts.
