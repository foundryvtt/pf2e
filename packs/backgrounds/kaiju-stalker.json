A normal hunter's game varies in size, with the deadliest quarries possessing venomous fangs or a ferocious bite. A monster hunter must be prepared for more supernatural maladies and terrors. As a kaiju stalker, you venture into the Wall of Heaven, Valashmai Jungle, or another land where the bounties are much bigger. A mere scale or feather is your grandest trophyâ€”the survival of your community your ultimate prize.</p>\n<p>Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to <strong>Strength</strong> or <strong>Dexterity</strong>, and one is a free attribute boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in Athletics and gain one Athletics skill feat of your choice, best suited toward the style of hunting you prefer.</p>\n<p>You're trained in Kaiju Lore. When rolling a Recall Knowledge check using Kaiju Lore and you have sight of one item that belongs to the kaiju you're attempting to Recall Knowledge about, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the skill check. The item can range from a scale to slime, to a footprint, or to crafted or harvested goods.</p>"
