Maybe you are officially part of the Wildwood Lodge, serving as a part-time bodyguard and negotiator to help maintain order—otherwise Taldan nobles might send in their own army to keep the peace. Whatever the case, you know that tensions are building between factions who support and oppose the lodge's current leader, Valenar the Green, and you might have to step in to keep the Greenwood Gala fun and welcoming.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts.
