When presented with a problem that's beyond your immediate ability to address or resolve, you'll spend days researching methods to provide what help the person needs, either educating yourself on how to provide the aid yourself or by arranging for others to step in to support the person in question.</p>\n<p>Choose two attribute boosts.
