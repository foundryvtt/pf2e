Whether it's the threat of a physical beating or the actual assault itself, the bully's methods are usually efficient at establishing a network full of fearful followers and social power. You may have been a bully yourself, and if so, you've never faced any significant comeuppance or retribution for your nefarious actions, and the skills you developed as a youth while bullying others serve you very well today. Yet maybe you weren't the bullyâ€”maybe you were a baiter of bullies instead? Someone who put on an irresistible-to-bullies appearance only to turn their tactics back upon them with threats and violence. Were you a champion of the picked-upon and downtrodden in schoolyard and back alley alike, who lured the local bullies into traps that taught them lessons writ in blood and pain?</p>\n<p>Choose two attribute boosts.
