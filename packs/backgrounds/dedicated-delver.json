Whether you're a veteran Darklands caravanner, a cartographer seeking safer paths through dangerous territory, or just a spelunker who loves to escape the surface and hear the caverns sing, you're adept at navigating underground obstacles and finding your way back to civilization.</p>\n<p>Clan Tolorr specializes more in studying the past than extracting it from dangerous areas. Its leader, Arghan Tolorr, was an avid explorer in his youth, and he's begun an initiative to befriend, recruit, and train subterranean daredevils who can extract relics responsibly. You're one of his candidates for this pilot program. Helping administrate recruits is Ria, a gnome curator and close Tolorr confidante who helped arrange your travel to Highhelm.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts.
