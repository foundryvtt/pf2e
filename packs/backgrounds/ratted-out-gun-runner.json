You made a good deal of money selling firearms from the Gunworks to people who perhaps shouldn't have had them. You even worked with wasteland marauders a few times, sticking up Ustradi barges plying the river between the Gunworks and Alkenstar. Of course, you never hurt any innocents or did anything truly heinous; your criminal career was always just a matter of money.</p>\n<p>One day, a corrupt financier named Ambrost Mugland-a true crook if there ever was one-approached you, demanding a cut of your business. When you refused, he put in a word with the shieldmarshals that you'd be a certain somewhere at a certain time with a certain large quantity of illegally obtained firearms. Even though you escaped arrest, your identity was compromised, and your old accomplices have all turned their backs on you. Your gun-running days are clearly over. Now, you're just running.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Stealth skill and the Firearm Lore skill.
