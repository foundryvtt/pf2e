Though you're still early in your hunting career, your talent shows great promise, and you have a natural knack for tracking and taking down big game such as moose, saber-toothed tigers, and even wild mammoths.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Strength</strong> or <strong>Dexterity</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Hunting Lore skill.
