One must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Charisma</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Thievery skill and the Underworld Lore skill. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Subtle Theft] skill feat.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when Gloriana Morilla is present during your mission briefings, she discreetly checks in with you and provides some pointers. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your checks to Gather Information or Recall Knowledge during the Getting Started segment of such adventures. Be sure to remind your GM that you have a relevant background.</p>"
