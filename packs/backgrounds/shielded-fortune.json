You may or may not believe you're more fated to face unexpected hardship in your life, but regardless, you know you can take what destiny has to dish out.</p>\n<p>This background is associated with the suit of Shields.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Constitution</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.
