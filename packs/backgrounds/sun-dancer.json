You could have been the apprentice of some primal caster who wished to harness the sun's power for their incantations or lived in a community who reveres the Daughter of the Cosmic Caravan through displays of veneration for the sun. Whatever the case, you developed a supernatural connection to the sun.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in Performance. You gain the Fascinating Performance skill feat. If you use this feat outdoors in direct sunlight, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the skill check.</p>"
