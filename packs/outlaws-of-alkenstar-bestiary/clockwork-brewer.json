Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most clockwork keepers wind all their clockworks at a set time, typically 8 a.m.</p>\n<p>A clockwork that lists standby in its wind-up entry can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity.

In the City of Smog, clockworks perform many of the simple, repetitive tasks that sentient workers find boring, as well as dangerous jobs such as private security or riot control.</p>\n<p>With the rise of the automated workforce in Alkenstar came the \"professional\" line of clockworks, capable of carrying out more complex tasks and even interacting with the public. These clockworks were given modules inscribed with information and procedures for carrying out a specific profession. The clockwork brewer is one such example, capable of extracting wort, stirring a fermenter, or monitoring a boiling temperature. As many other types of clockwork professional exist as there are professions; clockworks have been programmed to reshelf library books, swab ship decks, and fill holes in heavily trafficked roads.</p>\n<p>Clockwork professionals made by reputable manufacturers are generally considered safe to interact with the public. Accidents have been known to occur, however, particularly when careless engineers fail to perform regular maintenance checks or when operators program a clockwork with insufficiently specific directives. Flesh and blood laborers forced to work in close proximity to a clockwork professional tend to keep a wide berth.</p>",
