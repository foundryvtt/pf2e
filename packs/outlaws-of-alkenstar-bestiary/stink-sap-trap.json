While within the aura, the creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saves to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to stink sap for 1 minute. Creatures don't save against this effect in exploration mode and don't become temporarily immune, but creatures with stink sap on them must roll against their own aura when they roll initiative in encounter mode. The sap dissipates after 10 hours; spending 10 minutes scrubbing the sap off with soap and water reduces the duration by 1 hour.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-effects.Item.Effect: Stink Sap]</p>"
