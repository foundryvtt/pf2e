The sudden movement causes the thunderstone to clink against the jar and explode. All creatures in a @Template[type:burst|distance:10]{10-foot radius} take [[/r 2[sonic]]] damage and must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:17|traits:hazard,trap,mechanical] save or be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Deafened] for 1 round. In addition, each creature in that area is splattered with purple dye and showered with glass, taking [[/r (1d4+2)[piercing]]] damage (@Check[type:reflex|dc:20|basic:true|traits:hazard,trap,mechanical]). Creatures splattered with purple dye take a -1 circumstance penalty to Charisma-based skill checks. Fully dying the affected hair or clothing removes this penalty. Dyed skin fades after a week but can be covered up with a successful @Check[type:deception|dc:12|traits:hazard,trap,mechanical,action:disguise]{Disguise check} and the appropriate cosmetics.</p>"
