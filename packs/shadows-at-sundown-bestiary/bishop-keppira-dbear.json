A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fleeing] condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:25] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for [[/gmr 1d6 #Overcome Revulsions Duration]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sense Motive].</li>\n<li><strong>Sunlight</strong> When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious] and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful @Check[type:perception|dc:resolve(10+@actor.system.saves.reflex.value)] check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its \"dead\" body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Detect Alignment], senses like lifesense, and the \"corpse\" taking damage from vitality energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the \"corpse\" in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Water Revulsion</strong> A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 2} and gains the fleeing condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] or be destroyed.</li>\n</ul>"
