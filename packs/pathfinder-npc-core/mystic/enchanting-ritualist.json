You can alter the appearance of existing structures and creatures, and you can add illusory structures or creatures. For example, you could cause everything and everyone in the target area to appear green, create an illusory forest with a thick canopy that obscures the settlement from outside view, or make empty ruins seem inhabited and pristine. When you create the facade, you determine which illusory elements remain static (limited to basic natural movement, such as flags blowing in the breeze) and which follow a basic program (for example, a daily parade in the town square, complete with marching band). You're unable to alter the programs after you create the facade.</p>\n<p>You can disguise creatures as you please, with the same effects as a 3rd-rank illusory disguise. If a creature affected by the facade leaves the area, any illusions affecting it fade after 1 day. You decide when casting the ritual whether newcomers are disguised by the illusions, and whether the disguise appears immediately or after a set period, up to 1 week.</p>\n<p>A creature that interacts with the target settlement in a way that would suggest or reveal the illusory nature of the facade, such as by trying to paint a building affected by the facade or climbing an illusory structure, can attempt to disbelieve the illusion. The illusions created by the spell are harmless, so an illusory river of lava wouldn't cause damage, nor could thorns on an illusory rose bush prick someone.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You create the facade as described, and you can alter the programs within your facade by spending 1 day to reprogram them.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You create the facade as described.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> Your illusions fail and the ritual has no effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your ritual produces unexpected and uncontrolled illusions different from what you had planned, such as unexpected and slowly shifting colors across the buildings, unpleasant smells, and creatures appearing as skeletons. These effects fade after 1 month.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> The cost increases to 100,000 gp and the radius can be up to 5 miles</p>"

The casters must be in physical contact with one another in a circle for the duration of the casting, and all targets must be selected from these casters.</p>\n<p>A target's astral form is a duplicate of the target and everything they're carrying; anything that happens to a duplicate item happens to the original as well. For instance, if you use, spend, destroy, lose, or give away an item's duplicate, the original vanishes from your possession. For the duration of the ritual, any of the targets can spend a single action to Dismiss their astral form and immediately return to their physical body. As the primary caster, when you Dismiss your astral form, you can also Dismiss all the other targets' astral forms as part of the same action, returning all targets to their physical forms simultaneously. While in the Astral Plane, the other targets are unable to navigate without you, and if they become separated from you, they must wait for your return or Dismiss their own astral forms. When the ritual ends, the targets' astral forms vanish.</p>\n<p>A target's astral form and corresponding physical form are linked by an incorporeal silver cord, which is visible only in the Astral Plane. This nearly unbreakable cord serves as conduit and safety line; if severed, the target's astral and physical forms are both immediately slain. If the ritual is interrupted by an external force, such as dispel magic being cast on a target's physical or astral form, the target is immediately and harmlessly returned to their physical body. If a target's astral form is slain, the silver cord immediately rips them back to their physical body; the strain requires them to attempt a Fortitude save with the same DC as the ritual's primary check. On a failure, the creature dies; on a success, it becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 2}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 2}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed]{Doomed 2}, and enfeebled 2 for 1 week; these conditions can't be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed. A target's physical body remains in suspended animation for the duration of the ritual, but if it's destroyed, the creature dies and its astral form also vanishes. This ritual only projects a portion of the targets' consciousnesses onto the Astral Plane. To travel physically to the Astral Plane (to reach the Outer Planes, for example) requires spells such as interplanar teleport.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> All targets are able to navigate independently in the Astral Plane.

A <em>geas</em> to perform an act is usually conditional, such as, \"Always offer hospitality to strangers seeking a place to stay.\" An unconditional <em>geas</em> to perform a certain act doesn't require the target to perform that act exclusively, though it must prioritize the task above all leisurely pursuits. The most common <em>geas</em> to refrain from carrying out an act is a specification to avoid violating a contract. In those cases, the secondary caster usually takes charge of making sure the wording of the contract is attuned correctly with the ritual's magic. Because the target is willing, <em>geas</em> can have a duration that lasts for as long as the target agrees to. If the target is unable to fulfill the <em>geas</em>, it becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1}, and the sickened condition increases by 1 for each consecutive day it is prevented from following the <em>geas</em>, to a maximum of sickened 4. The sickened condition ends immediately when it follows the <em>geas</em> again; it can't remove the sickened condition in any other way. Only powerful magic such as a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wish] ritual can remove the effects of <em>geas</em> from a willing target.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The <em>geas</em> succeeds, and the target receives a +1 status bonus to skill checks that directly uphold the <em>geas</em> (at the GM's discretion).</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The <em>geas</em> succeeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The <em>geas</em> fails.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The <em>geas</em> fails, and you are instead affected by the <em>geas</em> you were attempting to place on the target.

If the target fails this Will save, the <em>geas</em> lasts up to 1 week. A <em>cleanse affliction</em> spell can counteract a <em>geas</em> on an unwilling creature, in addition to powerful magic such as a <em>wish</em> ritual. A clever unwilling creature can subvert the <em>geas</em> by contriving situations that prevent it from complying, but in that case it becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened] (as described above).</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> As 5th rank, but the <em>geas</em> lasts for up to 1 year on an unwilling creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> As 5th rank, but the <em>geas</em> lasts for a duration you choose (even unlimited) on an unwilling creature.</p>"
