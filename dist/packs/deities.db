Known as He Who Walks in Blood, he slumbers in the blood of heretics and worshippers alike in an immense cleft carved into the base of the Boneyard&rsquo;s spire, a realm known as the Blood Vale.

Once, when you would fail a Stealth check, you critically succeed instead. Achaekek typically grants this boon for an extremely consequential Stealth check that could lead to an assassination, such as one that could get you into position to kill an important target, but rarely on a Stealth check to help you escape.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You gain the god&rsquo;s approval to take a life.

To others, it&rsquo;s a malleable tool. And to a few, it&rsquo;s a source of purpose. With an understanding of spellcasting, creatures can cause fire to erupt from their hands, call otherworldly beings to aid them, bewitch the senses, and even bring the dead back to life. The ability to reshape reality to better suit one&rsquo;s needs and desires is a powerful call that most only dream of being able to answer, and few are ever able to truly master such might.<br /><br />One such master was Nethys, who was revered as a god-king in ancient Osirion. Having sought to unlock all of the secrets and potential held within the planes and beyond, Nethys shattered his own mind from the sheer overload of knowledge to which he was exposed. Witnessing all of creation, the secrets of the universe, and the vast expanse of what has been seen and will be seen rent his mind in the same moment he elevated to the status of a god. Nethys gained unlimited power and the skill to utilize it, but at the cost of his core self and mental security. This resulted in a split soul, two sides warring within the same body. One seeks to destroy the world, to purge it through fire and ruin, and to conquer all that exists.

However, blatant disregard and stifling of magic will certainly earn his ire.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Nethys casts a powerful spell to help you in a pinch. Once, Nethys casts a spell 1 level higher than the highest-level spell you can cast. If you can&rsquo;t cast spells, Nethys casts a 1st-level spell to help you.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Nethys grants you insight into the secrets of magic. Add one spell from a different tradition of magic to your spell list. You still must learn it or add it to your repertoire normally.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You are granted supreme magical knowledge and mastery. If you are a prepared spellcaster, you can switch one of your prepared spells for another spell you could have prepared in that slot; if you are a spontaneous spellcaster, you can switch one of the spells in your spell repertoire for another spell you could have chosen for your repertoire instead. In either case, you make this switch by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. (If you are neither a prepared nor a spontaneous spellcaster, Nethys won&rsquo;t grant you his major boon.)<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: The secrets of magic become mentally taxing. You are permanently stupefied 1.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Your magic wars against itself like Nethys&rsquo;s dueling halves. Whenever you cast a spell, attempt a DC 11 flat check. On a failure, if your spell was harmful, you instead cast a beneficial spell of the same level on your intended targets, and if it was beneficial, you instead cast a harmful spell of the same level on your intended targets. If the spell benefited some targets and harmed others, you cast a spell of the same level that switches who benefited (for instance, changing a heal spell that harmed undead and healed the living to a harm spell&nbsp;that healed undead and harmed the living). You still lose the spell slot for the spell you were trying to cast.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Nethys severs your connection to magic. You lose all your spellcasting abilities and cannot gain any future spellcasting.</span></p>","_id":"9EKyWmjLUu42evxC"}

Whenever another creature imagines vengeance upon you but can&rsquo;t pursue that vengeance because you are too powerful, well connected, or otherwise untouchable, a creature of roughly your level manifests out of their imagination and performs their desired revenge.

Most people thank her for her kind work to channel the sun&rsquo;s power for everyone&rsquo;s safety and livelihood, and thank her clergy for granting her healing power to all who need it. Mortals look to the Dawnflower as an example of boundless love, exquisite kindness, and true patience. They pray to her to heal the sick, lift up the downtrodden, and illuminate darkness of circumstance as well as darkness of spirit. Her followers aspire to emulate her through generosity, nurturing, truthfulness, and selfless courage.

The figurative and literal monsters who worship Rovagug share their myths and legends in secret shrines and hidden caves, calling him the Rough Beast, the Imprisoned King, the Tide of Fangs, the Unmaker, and the Worldbreaker. They tell each other that each life they snuff out, each piece of art they destroy, each work of labor they bring tumbling down puts a crack in the prison that holds their god.

Once, one of your failed or successful attacks becomes a critical hit, and your weapon or unarmed attack gains the deadly d12 trait for&nbsp;this attack, replacing any deadly trait it already had.

Andoletta makes a clear distinction between guilt and innocence: there is no in-between. For those falsely accused or who show signs of redemption, she offers a path back to the light. That path is never an easy one, but it is one worth walking, and she stands beside those who make the trek. For the truly wicked and those who show no remorse, she has no mercy. For these reasons, her likeness is often found in courts, where she can watch over and ensure fairness to those accused of crimes. Andoletta also places great value on respect for the dead and the protection of children. To offer solace to the bereaved is true kindness and compassion. Children are slates with tremendous potential for good&mdash;if they can be guided and kept safe from evil.<br /><br />When she appears to mortals, Grandmother Crow does so as an older woman, gray-haired, wrinkled, and with keen, knowing eyes.

Just as the legend speaks of their ultimate unity, those who now follow the Green Faith and view nature as sacred understand the interconnectedness of all beings, recognizing that harmony is possible only through balance, and that the cycles of nature are both delicate and infinite. Advocates of the Green Faith therefore fall into a neutral alignment, for they understand that by naming one thing, its opposite is also created; they walk the path of balance between death and rebirth, light and shadow, growth and decay.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> guide civilization to grow in harmony with nature, preserve areas of natural wilderness, protect endangered species<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> cause damage to natural settings, kill animals for reasons other than self-defense or sustenance, allow abuse of natural resources<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> veneration of the natural world<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, LN, N, CN, NE</span></span></p>","_id":"KT7HKL7vbZEwbzX4"}

If Asmodeus&rsquo;s own scriptures are to believed&mdash;and they are corroborated by certain other accounts, like the angel-penned <em>Book of the Damned</em>&mdash;he is one of the oldest beings of the multiverse. These texts claim that in time before time, in a world not yet created, Asmodeus and his brother Ihys were among the first gods in existence. During these unnamed ages, the two gods quarreled over the fate of the souls of their creations, and Asmodeus slew his brother. Confident that Ihys&rsquo;s act of granting mortals free will was folly, Asmodeus made his own convictions known: that existence is best served by absolute order and discipline. These claims contradict other popular creation myths, and both theologians and immortal agents of the gods doubt Asmodeus&rsquo;s claims to varying degrees, but while there is no evidence to prove them, they are also difficult to refute.</span><br /><br /><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><strong>Edicts</strong> negotiate contracts to your best advantage, rule tyrannically and torture weaker beings, show subservience to your betters<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> break a contract, free a slave, insult Asmodeus by showing mercy to your enemies<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> contracts, pride, slavery, and tyranny <br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> any, though characters who commit themselves to Asmodeus this way have their souls bound to the Dark Prince for all eternity</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Deception</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>mace</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>confidence, fire, trickery, tyranny</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>duty, glyph</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: charm, 4th: suggestion, 6th: mislead</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Asmodeus tends to offer his gifts to entice those on the precipice of yielding to his vile temptations.

Once, for 1 minute, whenever you take slashing, piercing, or bleed damage, chains rip forth from your body, affecting creatures in a line from your position in the direction of the attack (or in the direction of your choice for bleed damage or if you deal the damage yourself) with the effect of a grim tendrils spell whose level is equal to half your level rounded up, and whose DC is your highest spell DC (or 10 + your level + your Wisdom modifier if you have no spell DC).<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Each morning, during your daily preparations, scars gather into words on your flesh.

Abraxas&rsquo;s cults are most prevalent among the drow of Golarion, but small circles devoted to him can be found in most major cities on the surface as well.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> Learn and hoard forbidden magic, steal secrets from others<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> Destroy forbidden lore, reveal the entirety of a secret<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> forbidden lore, magic, and snakes<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NE, CE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability&nbsp;</strong>Intelligence or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Society</div>\n<div><strong>Favored </strong><strong>Weapon</strong> crossbow</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> cities, earth, travel, wealth</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>duty</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: illusory object, 4th: creation, 7th: magnificent mansion</div>\n</div>"}

Often called Desna&rsquo;s Shadow, the Black Butterfly is sometimes believed to be an aspect of Desna that has broken off and taken on its own life; her interest in distance and space certainly reflects Desna&rsquo;s love of travel. The Black Butterfly finds the silence of the sea of stars useful for introspection and learning about oneself. Those who follow her take opportunities when they can to sit in silent meditation, in zones of silence and darkness when possible. Travel across large distances offers plenty to think about and contemplate, and the Black Butterfly encourages such journeys. She hates all evil, but she truly despises the powerful beings of evil that populate the Dark Tapestry, and her followers are expected to fight these beings and their followers without mercy.<br /><br />The Silence Between manifests as the silhouette of a woman with butterfly wings, and white hair and eyes. Her wings contain a shadow&mdash;or reflection&mdash;of all of the Dark Tapestry and everything within it. Parted lovers, the isolated, the introverted, those who have sworn vows of silence or don&rsquo;t communicate verbally, stargazers, explorers, and the melancholy are all found among the followers of the Black Butterfly.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> Study the stars, notice moments of silence, perform anonymous acts of kindness<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> Disrupt another&rsquo;s meditation, interrupt tranquil moments, play noisy or discordant music<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> distance, silence, and space<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, CG</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Dexterity or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Stealth</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>starknife</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>freedom, secrecy, star, void</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: penumbral shroud, 2nd: blur, 4th: blink</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","_id":"c9NFjRR8gr6CWpjl"}

Shelyn&rsquo;s religion does not require chastity, fidelity, or a particular relationship structure, as the passion of early romance is a facet of love just as important and valid as the comfortable trust between a long-married couple.

They typically wear a gold dragon's foot brooch, or have other custom-made equipment in the shape of a dragon's foot. Golarion lacks much of a centralized humanoid church of Apsu. The largest congregation of humanoid Apsu worshipers on the planet is known as the Platinum Band, which maintains relatively small centers of worship in Oppara and Absalom. Apsu is more widely worshiped by humanoids on the planet Triaxus, where he is the patron deity of the Dragon Legion. The Legion's leaders prohibit their priests from revealing Apsu's connection to Golarion, so younger legionnaires would not be tempted to prematurely journey there to help him.

He avoids bestowing misfortune as punishment, preferring to do so only to give an individual a challenging obstacle to overcome to help them progress in their quest for self-perfection.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Irori grants you great insight and knowledge. Once, when you roll a failure at a check to Recall Knowledge, you get a critical success instead. Furthermore, the check loses the secret trait, so you know for sure that the result was a critical success. Irori typically grants this boon for an extremely consequential check to Recall&nbsp;Knowledge.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Your body rebuilds after adversity, becoming stronger. You can cast wholeness of body as an occult ki spell. If you didn&rsquo;t have one already, you gain a focus pool with 1 Focus Point and are trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs (the sidebar on the &lt;classes%8%%&gt;monk class page has full information on what happens when you gain your first ki spell).<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You can temporarily ascend to a greater form. You can cast 8th-level righteous might once per day as an occult innate spell. When you do, your form appears unremarkable, rather than clad in powerful armaments.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Irori challenges you to seek another path, rather than treat every problem as a nail just because you have a hammer. If you select a check for which you have a higher bonus when another method would have been more appropriate for the situation, such as using Deception to lie through life because it&rsquo;s your highest modifier, even if it would be better to reach a compromise through Diplomacy, you must roll twice and take the lower result.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Irori challenges you to adapt to adversity in order to perfect yourself. You become weighed down as if under heavy weights, becoming clumsy 2 and encumbered until you accomplish a challenging task of Irori&rsquo;s choosing.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Irori makes all living creatures forget your existence. This can be further compounded by raising Irori&rsquo;s ire, resulting in your name being obliterated from all written records. In both cases, memories and writings rearrange themselves to omit you smoothly, rather than leaving obvious gaps.&lt;/classes%8%%&gt;</span></p>"}

While the other dwarven gods represent specific areas of dwarven life and culture, thus forming an expansive and comprehensive dwarven pantheon, Torag’s areas of concern are those most central to dwarven society. In his own family, Torag models the values of community and protection that have cemented deep-rooted relationships among dwarven clans. His focus on strategy and tactical acumen centers on protection, reflected in dwarves’ impenetrable fortresses and conservative military tactics, including their willingness to use offensive maneuvers as a form of defense. He also represents the forge: the creation of fine works from raw materials, practice and mastery of a craft, and pride in one’s work. His purview extends even to those activities that feed the forge and dwarven artisanship, such as mining the earth for raw ore and gemstones. Torag’s oversight over these core concepts has secured his place at the head of the dwarven pantheon for ages. It was Torag who sent the dwarves on their legendary Quest for Sky during the Age of Darkness, and his worship was long-established even then. Indeed, among dwarves, Torag is often called the Father of Creation.<br><br><strong>Edicts</strong> be honorable and forthright, keep your word, respect the forge, serve your people<br><strong>Anathema</strong> tell lies or cheat someone, intentionally create inferior works, show mercy to the enemies of your people<br><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> forge, protection, and strategy<br><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, LN</span><br></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Constitution or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Crafting</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>warhammer</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>creation, earth, family, protection</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>duty</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: mindlink, 3rd: earthbind, 4th: creation</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Torag makes his pleasure or displeasure known through unsubtle signs.<br><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Torag repairs your equipment so you may continue your vigil.

Torag can grant this boon just as the item would have been destroyed, preventing the item’s destruction. Occasionally, he grants this boon to restore an item important to dwarven history that has already been fully destroyed.<br><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You are counted as family among Torag and his followers. You gain the effects of a single dwarf ancestry feat of Torag’s choice, even if you are not a dwarf, as long as you maintain Torag’s blessing.<br><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Standing watch or guarding a location counts as resting for you, preventing you from being fatigued due to lack of rest as long as you stand watch for at least 6 hours a day. You can recover your Focus Points (if you have them) by standing guard in addition to any other options you have available. When on guard, you gain a +4 status bonus to Perception to notice ambushes and other dangers approaching.

Members of your community have their attitudes towards you shift two steps worse, meaning those who used to be helpful are now indifferent, those who were friendly are now unfriendly, and all others are now hostile.

Despite this, Besmara and her worshippers are generally loyal to one another, knowing that while on the waves raiding ships for treasure, a pirate crew can survive only if its members trust one another.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> sail the seas, stay loyal to captain and crew, take what you want<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> betray shipmates, forsake piracy, settle on land<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> piracy, sea monsters, and strife<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> CG, CN, CE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Dexterity or Constitution</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm or heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Athletics</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>rapier</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>destruction, trickery, water, wealth</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: hydraulic push, 3rd: feet to fins, 5th: mariner's curse</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Due to her fiery temperament, the Pirate Queen is quick to punish or reward her followers, and is equally fast at rescinding her favor or forgiving transgressions.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Besmara wants you to amuse her, placing both plunder and peril in your path. This intercession often takes the form of an unexpected treasure map, a message in a bottle, or some other sign leading you to a great reward, assuming you can handle the challenges along the way.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You are at home on the seas and always ready to plunder an enemy vessel or defend your own.

You can&rsquo;t reduce this condition until you can no longer see the sea or are off the boat, though you can manage to stomach enough food and water to survive on a voyage, with extreme discomfort.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: You meet extreme financial ruin for daring to gravely offend the Pirate Queen. Besmara&rsquo;s agents steal all your booty and bring the spoils to Besmara&rsquo;s ship, Seawraith. If you want a chance to recover your lost wealth, you must parlay with the goddess and accept whatever dangerous terms she offers, usually requiring a heist she will find sufficiently amusing to watch whether you succeed or fail, and requiring you to trade your spoils from that quest for your previous belongings.</span></p>","_id":"wkDOeK7ENz1ra8IC"}

Formerly an artificial intelligence cloned from the mind of an android from outer space, Casandalee gained her godhood in the heart of Numeria within the computer core of a crashed spaceship, becoming the patron of artificial life, free thinking, and intellectual apotheosis.<br /><br />Though she is sometimes referred to as the Iron Goddess, Casandalee is much more than simple metal. She sometimes appears as a holographic reconstruction of her android form: a female humanoid with purple hair, blue lips, and pale skin traced with glowing circuitry, but upon close inspection, this image seems to consist of millions of complex algorithms of pure light. Casandalee and her followers seek to promote the advancement of Golarion&rsquo;s technology so that the world&rsquo;s inhabitants can better understand&mdash; and not fear&mdash;the complex mechanisms of so-called artificial life, including androids and free-willed artificial intelligences.

Casandalee typically grants this boon for particularly consequential violations of autonomy and agency.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Your organs are partially transformed into mechanical counterparts. You gain resistance 10 to negative damage, and the DC of your flat check to remove persistent bleed damage is only 5.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Casandalee backs up your memory and soul within her divine data flow. After you die, she casts your consciousness into a new artificial body. While Casandalee constructed your new body artificially, it is otherwise similar to the old, with the same effects as a critical success on a resurrection ritual. Casandalee is instead willing to provide different bodies to those who request them.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Your joints stiffen, and your mind becomes clouded. You take a &ndash;2 status penalty to all rolls for initiative.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Casandalee attempts to bring you unwanted intellectual advancement to help you become something better. Each day, at some point during the day, Casandalee bestows a strange insight upon you that you find uncomfortable. If you embrace it, you aren&rsquo;t otherwise affected, but if you don&rsquo;t, you become confused for 10 minutes.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: The code of your soul is constantly being rewritten, and not for the better.

Known as He Who Walks in Blood, he slumbers in the blood of heretics and worshippers alike in an immense cleft carved into the base of the Boneyard&rsquo;s spire, a realm known as the Blood Vale. He keeps no formal relationships with any other deities, even his sister, Grandmother Spider, who repeatedly coaxes Achaekek to rebel against the gods and abandon his duties.

Once, when you would fail a Stealth check, you critically succeed instead. Achaekek typically grants this boon for an extremely consequential Stealth check that could lead to an assassination, such as one that could get you into position to kill an important target, but rarely on a Stealth check to help you escape.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You gain the god&rsquo;s approval to take a life. You can cast death knell once per day as an innate divine spell.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Death lives in your very blade.

She embodies two aspects halflings see in themselves: a strong affinity for luck and bold determination to protect friends. Chaldira is hotheaded and cannot abide bullies in any form, and many of her worshippers are similarly impetuous, spoiling for any opportunity to leap fist-first at oppressors and tyrants. While many people consider this to be more of a vice than a virtue, Chaldira and her followers feel it is far better to run headlong into trouble than it is to meekly concede to evil out of fear or convenience. Chaldira is also the goddess of light-hearted mischief, insisting that harmless fun, even at others&rsquo; expense, brings joy and strengthens ties within a community. While not all of Chaldira&rsquo;s followers are inveterate pranksters, most at least know some sleight-of-hand tricks.

The order was founded in 3988 AR when the gentleman-explorer Aldus Canter returned from the Osirian desert where he had been lost for 3 years. Aldus spoke of meeting a cult following a desiccated angel named Tabris. Tabris revealed the secret history of the multiverse and tasked Aldus with acting as a messenger of mystic secrets. Upon his return, Aldus gathered a coterie of his fellow Ustalavic nobles eager to plumb these secrets. His message was far from clear, however, consisting of garbled and coded texts in an untidy medley of Osirian mysticism, Pharasmin rites, and Varisian occult lore. Scouring Aldus&rsquo;s texts&mdash;both those brought from Osirion and his many annotations and reinterpretations penned thereafter&mdash;has been the order&rsquo;s primary activity for centuries, even before the increasingly erratic Aldus disappeared in 4028 AR. The Esoteric Order&rsquo;s meticulous research has produced occult secrets and mystical rites known nowhere else on Golarion and hints at further secret lore for the enlightened. The order&rsquo;s greatest accomplishment, however, was averting a doomsday few on Golarion will ever realize was imminent: in 4718 AR, the order&rsquo;s greatest heroes prevented the planet Aucturn from devouring Golarion.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> seek out wisdom of ancient cultures (particularly Ancient Osirion), provide succor to scholars, honor the rites of the order<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> reveal the order&rsquo;s secrets to those outside the organization (or even to insufficiently ranked members), destroy rare or ancient lore<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> history, occultism, secret lore<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, LN, N, LE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Intelligence or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Occultism</div>\n</div>","_id":"3lgzcg84J0fsVqjh"}

These god callers may have unique titles or names among the people of their clan, and such monikers differ from clan to clan, but most of the clans of Sarkoris are able to distinguish a god caller by their unique dress or glyph that ties the caller to their god.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> The gods of Sarkoris have very few shared edicts, but several are often prominently shared amongst them: protect your clan and your people, educate the clan&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s in the traditions and histories of the clan&rsquo;s god, and carefully record the name and image of each new god when they first appear so that they are not forgotten and can continue to watch over the people.<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> There is only one anathema universally enforced by the gods of Sarkoris: make no deals or bargains with demons, as the advent of the Worldwound led to the destruction of many clans and the loss of many gods, some of whom may never be seen again.<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Each god has their own particular inclinations and interests, typically informed by the predominant attitudes and beliefs of their clan.</span></span></p>","_id":"oduHa5yyTisFsIRD"}

Infuriated at her position as a lackey, she made fools of the greater gods through mischief and disruption. She stole and copied @Compendium[pf2e.deities.QRkcFciCOmFoxF1B]{Asmodeus}'s keys, resulting in widespread chaos, and pilfered some of @Compendium[pf2e.deities.BNycwu3I21dTh4D9]{Sarenrae}'s fire, leading numerous followers astray. Nimbly avoiding any retribution for her antics, Grandmother Spider rewove the strands of fate for herself, gaining her freedom. She regularly pleads with her brother @Compendium[pf2e.deities.51kMMWaT6CqpGlGk]{Achaekek} to follow her lead and rebel against the gods, and while he always refuses, seemingly indifferent, Achaekek has on one notable occasion proven vengeful toward those who harm his sister or her followers.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> be skilled and clever, think for yourself, take due payment for your work, humiliate the powerful<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> abuse someone you have power over, harm someone who has given you sincere kindness, let a slight go unanswered, own a slave<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> family, illusion, stories, twilight, weaving<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, CG, N, CN</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Intelligence or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm or heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Crafting</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>bola</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>creation, family, fate, trickery</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>change, darkness</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: pest form, 2nd: web, 4th: glibness</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Though the Weaver often condones bad decisions so long as a lesson is learned, and is even willing to accept being fairly tricked herself, cruelty and predation upon the weak draw her outrage.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Grandmother Spider rescues your prank from the jaws of failure.

Such a creature or object takes 10d6 negative damage each round you continue touching it; the damage ignores all Hardness and is capable of destroying nonliving objects, creatures immune to negative effects, and even undead or other creatures with negative healing.

Few dragons practice divine magic, preferring to leave that to their humanoid allies. As Apsu's prime purpose is the destruction of Dahak, few non-dragons take up his cause, although honourable humanoids with an interest in draconic lore have taken up his faith from time to time. They typically wear a gold dragon's foot brooch, or have other custom-made equipment in the shape of a dragon's foot. Golarion lacks much of a centralized humanoid church of Apsu. The largest congregation of humanoid Apsu worshipers on the planet is known as the Platinum Band, which maintains relatively small centers of worship in Oppara and Absalom. Apsu is more widely worshiped by humanoids on the planet Triaxus, where he is the patron deity of the Dragon Legion. The Legion's leaders prohibit their priests from revealing Apsu's connection to Golarion, so younger legionnaires would not be tempted to prematurely journey there to help him.

This intercession often takes the form of an unexpected treasure map, a message in a bottle, or some other sign leading you to a great reward, assuming you can handle the challenges along the way.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You are at home on the seas and always ready to plunder an enemy vessel or defend your own. When aboard a boat, you gain a +2 status bonus to all initiative rolls, Acrobatics checks to Balance, and Athletics checks to Climb. In addition, you never get seasick.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You seem to be unaffected by storms. You ignore all effects and penalties caused by precipitation and winds, and you can see normally through fog, rain, and other weather conditions.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: You feel some of the effects of scurvy, making your wounds flow more easily. The DC of the flat check for you to remove persistent bleed damage is 20 instead of 15 (or 15 instead of 10 if using extremely efficient methods to assist your recovery), and you don&rsquo;t recover from persistent bleed damage automatically when you reach full Hit Points.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: You get seasick, becoming sickened 2 whenever you can see the sea or are on a boat at sea. You can&rsquo;t reduce this condition until you can no longer see the sea or are off the boat, though you can manage to stomach enough food and water to survive on a voyage, with extreme discomfort.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: You meet extreme financial ruin for daring to gravely offend the Pirate Queen. Besmara&rsquo;s agents steal all your booty and bring the spoils to Besmara&rsquo;s ship, Seawraith. If you want a chance to recover your lost wealth, you must parlay with the goddess and accept whatever dangerous terms she offers, usually requiring a heist she will find sufficiently amusing to watch whether you succeed or fail, and requiring you to trade your spoils from that quest for your previous belongings.</span></p>"}

She embodies two aspects halflings see in themselves: a strong affinity for luck and bold determination to protect friends. Chaldira is hotheaded and cannot abide bullies in any form, and many of her worshippers are similarly impetuous, spoiling for any opportunity to leap fist-first at oppressors and tyrants. While many people consider this to be more of a vice than a virtue, Chaldira and her followers feel it is far better to run headlong into trouble than it is to meekly concede to evil out of fear or convenience. Chaldira is also the goddess of light-hearted mischief, insisting that harmless fun, even at others&rsquo; expense, brings joy and strengthens ties within a community. While not all of Chaldira&rsquo;s followers are inveterate pranksters, most at least know some sleight-of-hand tricks.

If this ability is used for personal gain at the expense of someone innocent or less fortunate, Chaldira levies her moderate curse on you as punishment.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You gain a lucky impetuousness, allowing you to roll for initiative twice and use the higher result once per day.

In particular, he believes that although the tireless fight against wickedness is admirable, the ultimate triumph over evil will come in the form of redemption rather than destruction. Korada&rsquo;s dedication to peace is such that he and his followers refuse to cause harm to their attackers, instead using their martial skills only to defend themselves. Many Koradans seek greater wisdom through study or meditation in hopes of better understanding their foes so as to guide them toward redemption. This dedication to self-awareness, philosophy, and introspection is said to have allowed Korada greater insight into the workings of the universe, granting him the great gift of foresight. Korada rarely acts on his visions, however, believing the struggle that comes with true change is always worthwhile, whether or not such a change is successful.<br /><br />The Open Hand of Harmony takes the form of a lithe, athletic man donning simple robes. He is covered in sparse, light-brown fur and has three monkey tails that constantly writhe behind him, much like the dancing flames of a powerful fire. Most of Korada&rsquo;s followers are those who have lived imbalanced lives or faced persistent violence as they seek to find peace in their life and within themselves.

The fundamental principle behind the Laws is a relatively simple assertion that deific aid&mdash;even the best intentioned&mdash;ultimately comes at too high a price. The slaughter of fellow mortals for the glory of distant, unfathomable beings is not something that should be permitted within a society. Instead, mortal beings must shape their own fate, aware of their own limitations, trusting in their reliance upon one another and their shared values rather than divine intervention and guidance. This philosophy is summed up in the primary tenet of the Laws of Mortality: Let no mortal be beholden to a god.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> challenge religious power and the spread of religion, expose and eradicate hidden worship, provide a peaceful and autonomous society in which the people are cared for through social infrastructure<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> worship or swear an oath by a deity or religion, solicit or receive divine or religious aid, take a side in conflicts between religions<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> mortal affairs, peace, self-rule<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, NG, LN, N, LE, NE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Constitution or Intelligence</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Medicine</div>\n</div>","_id":"4I1aVKED08cwcC4H"}

Once per day, after attempting a check, you can roll a second time. You must use the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. This is a fortune effect. At any point after you use this boon, the GM can replace one of your check results with the first result of the check you attempted when using this boon; this delayed result can&rsquo;t be further delayed, prevented, or affected in any way, even by other divine intercessions.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Those who have done much to please Nivi find themselves slipping from sight when needed. Any time you attempt a Stealth check to Hide or Sneak, you also gain the effects of 2nd-level invisibility and fleet step spells to help you elude your enemies. These effects last until the end of your next turn or until you stop Hiding or Sneaking, whichever comes first (you can continue to Hide or Sneak, turn after turn, to extend these effects).<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Those who betray Nivi&rsquo;s trust find defeat where there was sure to be victory. Once, when you roll a natural 20 on a die, the result becomes a natural 1 instead. Nivi typically uses this curse for maximum poetic justice.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Those who arouse Nivi&rsquo;s wrath find themselves bound to the earth with no place to hide. You are wreathed in constant faerie fire and constantly affected by earthbind, and any effect that grants invisibility doesn&rsquo;t work on you.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Nivi curses unworthy adherents with recklessness.

The Crawling Chaos, as he is also known, appears humanlike not because he identifies with mortal concerns or cares for his mortal followers, but because a mortal shape makes it easier for him to do his work: spreading the influence of the Outer Gods.<br /><br />In his role as a herald, messenger, and agent provocateur for the Outer Gods, Nyarlathotep is the Outer God most likely to have direct interactions with mortals. He answers prayers, teaches evil magic, and inserts himself into history&mdash;all to enable mortal cruelty, facilitate the release of Great Old Ones, and turn whole societies toward worship of the Outer Gods.

Traditionally, each Shoanti undergoes a rite of passage into adulthood, during which time their particular totem manifests, and a Shoanti&rsquo;s first tattoo is an homage to that totem. The quahs and their most common totems are listed below:<br /><br /><strong>Lyrune-Quah (Moon Clan)</strong> bat, cave bear, moon, mountain lion, owl, stars<br /><strong>Shadde-Quah (Axe Clan)</strong> cliffs, eagle, sea, shark, squid, water elemental<br /><strong>Shriikirri-Quah (Hawk Clan)</strong> cloud, falcon, hawk, hippogriff, horse, wind<br /><strong>Shundar-Quah (Spire Clan)</strong> avalanche, earth elemental, mountain spire or peak, roc, spirestalker<br /><strong>Sklar-Quah (Sun Clan)</strong> aurochs, cindersnake, emberstorm, fire elemental, flames, the sun<br /><strong>Skoan-Quah (Skull Clan)</strong> ancestors, earth elemental, giant scarab beetle, vulture, will-o&rsquo;-wisp, wolf<br /><strong>Tamiir-Quah (Wind Clan)</strong> air elemental, cloud, griffon, roc, storm, wind<br /><br />According to their own tradition, Shoanti have lived in the northwestern lands of Avistan since long before colonizers fractured the Varisians&rsquo; homeland. Yet the Shoanti people still maintain their independence and traditional way of life in areas across Varisia, particularly on the Storval Plateau.<br /><br />Shoanti animism is rooted in a deep connection to the land. Shoanti see the earth not merely as a metaphorical parent, but as a conscious entity whose constant support is necessary for the survival of all life upon it&mdash;animal and vegetable alike. Their traditions emphasize connection and the reciprocal way in which the land provides for those who take care of it. The life force of the land serves as the source of Shoanti power and insight, rather than the otherworldly spiritual essence of the Great Beyond common to clerics. This life force is the birth of instinct and faith, and thus it sends omens to indicate future events, warning those with the wisdom to read the signs. Thus most Shoanti hold a profound reverence for natural phenomena as a manifestation of the will of the earth.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> <br /><strong>Anathema</strong></span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>","_id":"s1PgIQ8Oi35oS2Et"}

The Seventh Veil is widely regarded as the goddess of illusion magic, often portrayed as a figure disguised by seven veils. Legends state that each face underneath the first six of her seven veils is of a different ancestry&mdash;human, elf, halfling, gnome, anadi, and naga&mdash; but the seventh face is never shown, believed to mask the goddess&rsquo;s true form. Some theologians believe Sivanah hails from the Shadow Plane, though the goddess&rsquo;s true nature and form continue to be topics of debate. Even her female visage, while agreed upon by her followers, could likewise be an illusion. Her goals are hidden from even her most faithful, which some believe to have hampered the faith&rsquo;s growth and influence beyond the level of a cult.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> show the beauty in illusions, pursue the nature of truth, respect the need for secrets<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> use illusions and shadows to harm another creature, reveal a secret you have sworn to keep<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> illusions, mysteries, reflections, secrets<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, LN, N, CN, NE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Wisdom or Charisma</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm or heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Deception</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>bladed scarf</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>delirium, magic, secrecy, trickery</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>glyph</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: illusory disguise, 4th: veil, 5th: shadow siphon</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The Seventh Veil abhors the use of illusion to cause harm and detests anyone who discourages or corrupts the process of truth-seeking. The goddess works actively against the faith of Zon-Kuthon and his clerics&rsquo; use of shadow. <br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Sivanah prevents your enemies from pulling off your veil. Once, when a foe rolls a success on a Perception check to disbelieve your illusion, it gets a critical failure instead. Sivanah typically grants this benefit to protect an elaborate or consequential illusory deception, and she never uses it to improve the effect of a harmful illusion.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You wear a veil of illusion wherever you go. You can cast illusory disguise at will as an innate divine spell.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You spread your illusions over a larger area. You can designate an area to permanently gain the effects of hallucinatory terrain. All creatures within this area gain the effects of <em>illusory disguise</em>, changing their forms as you wish. You can designate a new area as a 1-minute activity, but doing so dismisses any previously designated areas.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Your hair becomes a wild variety of colors, which cannot be altered with mundane or magical means, and it somehow grows out from under any cap, scarf, or other headwear intended to disguise it. You gain a &ndash;2 status penalty to Deception skill checks to Impersonate anyone else.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Those who betray the secrets of others find their own secrets laid bare. Each person from whom you are keeping a secret immediately learns one of your secrets involving that person.

Soralyon believes that monuments and ruins are important links to the past. Guarding them against those who would defile or destroy them is of tremendous importance, lest people lose memories of who they are, where they came from, and what they have accomplished. As such, those who stand guard over monuments and ruins are blessed. Likewise, those who study monuments to the past and present with respect, or seek to preserve them for the future, are also blessed. Guardianship of others, but especially of those who study and preserve these relics to the past, is also of great importance to Soralyon. As magic is a valuable tool in guarding, studying, and preserving these monuments and people, Soralyon encourages the study of magic, preferably for use in learning or protection.<br /><br />When the Mystic Angel appears to mortals he usually does so as a handsome being beautifully carved of smooth marble, the hues of which range the entire spectrum of the stone but tend toward those most common locally. Followers of Soralyon include archaeologists, historians, bodyguards, guardians, sculptors, curators, and arcane spellcasters.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> Study monuments, craft golems and artwork from stone, guard ancient sites<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> Defile sacred buildings, knowingly unearth evil monuments, destroy historical artifacts<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> guardians, monuments, and magic<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, NG, CG, N</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Strength or Intelligence</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Arcana</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>pick</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>creation, earth, magic, protection</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: summon construct, 3rd: meld into stone, 4th: stoneskin</div>\n</div>","_id":"vnmoAGURp8oWCY6R"}

Ydajisk is also called the Mother of Tongues, though like all proteans, their gender changes as they will. Followers of Ydajisk are wanderers, reviving dead languages from ancient ruins, chronicling the dying tongues of cultures in decline, and discovering or inventing new words. All such knowledge acquired by agents of the Mother of Tongues passes into Ydajisk&rsquo;s realm, the Library of Stolen Words, where it is transcribed into books or stored in magical containers, alongside scrolls and tomes considered long lost by mortal scholars.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> Create using words, chronicle languages and prevent them from dying, help language evolve<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> Ban or discourage a language, explain a secret language or slang to outsiders, destroy literary works<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> language evolution, lost words, and slang<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> CG, CN, CE</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Intelligence or Charisma</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font</strong> harm or heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Society</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>jaws or greatclub</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>change, glyph, knowledge, trickery</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: message rune, 2nd: abyssal plague (blistering invective (Advanced Player's Guide, coming soon)), 4th: glibness</div>\n</div>","_id":"iEt6idGIEPXY2HzV"}

Also known as Harborwing, she believes in harmony between the seas, the skies, and the beings of the land. Sustenance and resources can be taken from the sea by those on shore, but not so much that the balance is upset. The sea may sometimes encroach on the land, but breakwaters can be built to keep communities on land dry and safe. Ylimancha likewise loves all creatures that fly, though the demon lord @Compendium[pf2e.deities.IZcdF1G8ZsnMotaM]{Pazuzu} also claims dominion over them, bringing the two into endless conflict and causing her to mourn deeply each creature he converts to his worship.<br /><br />Harborwing most often appears as a very large seagull, pure white in color with the head of a Varisian woman with short, dark hair. She sometimes instead appears as a human woman with the head of an osprey. In this form she wears robes that sway like the waves of the sea, their blue folds foaming white at the edges, and she carries a teak longbow strung with gold. When she speaks, her voice carries the sound of the crashing waves.

In appearance, he is said to be a congeries of iridescent spheres&mdash;brilliant, foaming bubbles that constantly expand and collapse in upon themselves. He has other manifestations, however, including the Lurker on the Threshold, a mass of black tentacles that endlessly writhe, reach, and grow, and a mysterious humanoid figure hidden behind a shimmering veil.<br /><br />Yog-Sothoth embodies all of space and time; he exists in all places and in all moments simultaneously. Paradoxically, however, he is unable to manifest in the mortal universe unless summoned, a magical act that almost always results in untold destruction. He is known as the Key and the Gate, and magicians and cults research him in an effort to master time and space. Fortunately, his worship is not widespread, but some of those who have delved deep into his secrets describe him as an ambivalent figure, rather than a malevolent one, who guards cosmic secrets and makes them accessible to those who dare to ask for them. Yog-Sothoth reveals the true nature of the universe, but this is a thing that once seen cannot be unseen, and wise mortals turn aside from Yog-Sothoth&rsquo;s offer of cosmic knowledge in favor of a more mundane existence.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> Gather knowledge of gates through space and time, curse or mutate unborn children<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> None<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> CN, CE</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Intelligence or Charisma</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Occultism</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>dagger</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>knowledge, time, travel, void</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: fleet step, 5th: black tentacles, 7th: time beacon</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>","_id":"SUaGdvQXxSAQAw03"}

She believes that mysteries lead to truth, but how one arrives at that truth is as important as the answer itself. All questions are puzzles, and all puzzles are worth solving. The more intricate the problem, the more rewarding the investigation, and through determination and ethical investigation, even the deepest of enigmas can be solved. Calculated, logical thinking is more important to Zohls than gut instinct. She sees patterns everywhere, and she teaches that detecting these patterns brings the truth to light. While all investigations are worth pursuing so long as they don&rsquo;t hurt innocents, investigations that reveal the truth of crimes or other horrors, and that lead to justice being served and victims finding peace, are the most important of all to Verity.<br /><br />When appearing to her followers, Verity is always practically dressed, usually wearing a tunic and breeches. She wears black and white clothing, as these colors represent the light of truth and the darkness of obscurity and the unknown. She keeps her light-brown hair pulled back in braids. On her back she has large wings made of parchment that never wrinkle, whether furled or unfurled.
