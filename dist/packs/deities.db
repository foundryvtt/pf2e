Why would the gods craft Golarion into a near-endless buffet abundant with pleasures of the body and mind if the living weren&rsquo;t destined to feast from it? Urgathoa so loved satiating her life&rsquo;s appetites that in death, she spat in the face of Pharasma&rsquo;s judgment, murdered the psychopomp assigned to aid her transition to the afterlife, and tore herself from the Boneyard with a feat of will that not only returned her to the Material Plane but also transformed her into the first divine undead creature.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> become undead upon death, create or protect the undead, sate your appetites<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> deny your appetites, destroy undead, sacrifice your\u001elife<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> disease, gluttony, and undeath<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LE, NE, CE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Constitution or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Intimidation</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>scythe</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>indulgence, magic, might, undeath</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>decay, swarm</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: goblin pox, 2nd: false life, 7th: mask of terror</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Urgathoa interferes in mortal affairs to fuel her own self-gratification and obsession with observing new sensations.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: You feast on the spoils of life and death.

To others, it&rsquo;s a malleable tool. And to a few, it&rsquo;s a source of purpose. With an understanding of spellcasting, creatures can cause fire to erupt from their hands, call otherworldly beings to aid them, bewitch the senses, and even bring the dead back to life. The ability to reshape reality to better suit one&rsquo;s needs and desires is a powerful call that most only dream of being able to answer, and few are ever able to truly master such might.<br /><br />One such master was Nethys, who was revered as a god-king in ancient Osirion. Having sought to unlock all of the secrets and potential held within the planes and beyond, Nethys shattered his own mind from the sheer overload of knowledge to which he was exposed. Witnessing all of creation, the secrets of the universe, and the vast expanse of what has been seen and will be seen rent his mind in the same moment he elevated to the status of a god. Nethys gained unlimited power and the skill to utilize it, but at the cost of his core self and mental security. This resulted in a split soul, two sides warring within the same body. One seeks to destroy the world, to purge it through fire and ruin, and to conquer all that exists. The other attempts to protect the world, to elevate and educate, and to release it from its limits.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> seek out magical power and use it<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> pursue mundane paths over magical ones<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> magic<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, LN, N, CN, NE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Wisdom or Intelligence</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm or heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Arcana</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>staff</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>destruction, knowledge, magic, protection</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>glyph</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: magic missile, 2nd: magic mouth, 3rd: levitate, 4th: blink, 5th: prying eye, 6th: wall of force, 7th: warp mind, 8th: maze, 9th: disjunction</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Nethys is often impartial to his followers and their wishes, so it is rare to gain a heightened favor from the god of magic. However, blatant disregard and stifling of magic will certainly earn his ire.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Nethys casts a powerful spell to help you in a pinch. Once, Nethys casts a spell 1 level higher than the highest-level spell you can cast. If you can&rsquo;t cast spells, Nethys casts a 1st-level spell to help you.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Nethys grants you insight into the secrets of magic. Add one spell from a different tradition of magic to your spell list. You still must learn it or add it to your repertoire normally.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You are granted supreme magical knowledge and mastery. If you are a prepared spellcaster, you can switch one of your prepared spells for another spell you could have prepared in that slot; if you are a spontaneous spellcaster, you can switch one of the spells in your spell repertoire for another spell you could have chosen for your repertoire instead. In either case, you make this switch by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. (If you are neither a prepared nor a spontaneous spellcaster, Nethys won&rsquo;t grant you his major boon.)<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: The secrets of magic become mentally taxing. You are permanently stupefied 1.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Your magic wars against itself like Nethys&rsquo;s dueling halves. Whenever you cast a spell, attempt a DC 11 flat check. On a failure, if your spell was harmful, you instead cast a beneficial spell of the same level on your intended targets, and if it was beneficial, you instead cast a harmful spell of the same level on your intended targets. If the spell benefited some targets and harmed others, you cast a spell of the same level that switches who benefited (for instance, changing a heal spell that harmed undead and healed the living to a harm spell&nbsp;that healed undead and harmed the living). You still lose the spell slot for the spell you were trying to cast.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Nethys severs your connection to magic. You lose all your spellcasting abilities and cannot gain any future spellcasting.</span></p>","_id":"9EKyWmjLUu42evxC"}

Silver-tongued and charming, she is a master of weaving insults into compliments and laying intricate groundwork for retribution at its finest. She is a goddess of vengeance, but it would be a mistake to assume that means she pursues justice. Calistria is fickle, shifting her loyalties and interests as her whims take her&mdash;though she never forgets a slight, and any who think she has forgiven will surely find it is only a matter of time before they are targeted by a long-term plot of revenge to lay them thoroughly low.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> pursue your personal freedom, seek hedonistic thrills, take revenge<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> become too consumed by love or a need for revenge, let a slight go unanswered<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> lust, revenge, and trickery<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> CG, CN, CE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Dexterity or Charisma</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm or heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Deception</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>whip</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>pain, passion, secrecy, trickery</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: charm, 3rd: enthrall, 6th: mislead</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Signs of favor or displeasure from the Savored Sting are sometimes subtle and at other times incontrovertible. Calistria typically grants her boon to those on the path toward great vengeance and curses those who slight her followers, particularly if those followers are sex workers, though her fickle heart rarely commits to any absolute guidelines.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Calistria smiles on the riskiest deceptions. Once, when you roll a failure on a check to Lie, you get a critical success instead. Calistria typically grants this boon for an extremely consequential lie.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: A foot-long wasp finds and befriends you. It serves you as a familiar as long as you maintain Calistria&rsquo;s grace. The wasp always has the burrower and flier familiar abilities.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Calistria guides you towards vengeance. You always know the direction and distance towards the nearest creature that has wronged you and thus far gone unpunished.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Whenever a new person desires vengeance against you, you suffer a painful sting and are afflicted with giant wasp venom at stage 1.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: People react as though you&rsquo;re insulting them, even in normal conversation. Whenever you attempt to Make an Impression, the outcome is one degree of success worse than the result of your roll. If you converse with someone over a long enough period of time but don&rsquo;t attempt to Make an Impression, you still insult them, and you suffer the effect of a critical failure to Make an Impression.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: You have wronged those unable to obtain revenge for themselves, and Calistria&rsquo;s curse grants their revenge its own life. Whenever another creature imagines vengeance upon you but can&rsquo;t pursue that vengeance because you are too powerful, well connected, or otherwise untouchable, a creature of roughly your level manifests out of their imagination and performs their desired revenge. Once the revenge is complete or the manifestation is destroyed, the summoned creature vanishes from existence.</span></p>"}

Most people thank her for her kind work to channel the sun&rsquo;s power for everyone&rsquo;s safety and livelihood, and thank her clergy for granting her healing power to all who need it. Mortals look to the Dawnflower as an example of boundless love, exquisite kindness, and true patience. They pray to her to heal the sick, lift up the downtrodden, and illuminate darkness of circumstance as well as darkness of spirit.

Once, when you heal another creature, instead of healing it for the normal amount, you heal the creature to full Hit Points, no matter how much damage it has taken. Sarenrae typically grants this boon in extremely consequential circumstances.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Your blade burns the irredeemable. Your attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire damage that ignores fire resistance.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You are a voice of peace and rehabilitation. When you roll a success at a check to Request something, you get a critical success instead. In addition, all creatures other than fiends, undead, and mindless creatures allow you one chance to speak your piece and make requests before entering combat. If you or an ally ever use the time from the request to gain an advantage in an ensuing combat (for example, by casting preparatory spells, positioning for combat, or waiting out your opponent&rsquo;s preparatory spells), Sarenrae immediately revokes this boon, or possibly curses your ally.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: The sun burns you for your transgression. You receive a sunburn that causes you to become permanently clumsy 1.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: The sun shines its light on everything you say. You become unable to tell lies, and if you attempt to do so, you instead compulsively blurt out the truth on the matter in question. You are still able to withhold information or lie by omission.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Sarenrae restricts your ability to harm others. All attacks you make, spells you cast, and other sources of damage you deal are nonlethal except&nbsp;against fiends and undead, and you can&rsquo;t ever make them lethal. You deal minimum damage except against fiends and undead.

He has little use for one, for his sole commandment is to destroy, and his followers need no instruction in how to accomplish that. The figurative and literal monsters who worship Rovagug share their myths and legends in secret shrines and hidden caves, calling him the Rough Beast, the Imprisoned King, the Tide of Fangs, the Unmaker, and the Worldbreaker. They tell each other that each life they snuff out, each piece of art they destroy, each work of labor they bring tumbling down puts a crack in the prison that holds their god.

He is as likely to curse those who draw his attention as he is to reward them, though great enough acts of violence and destruction may earn his favor.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Your attack becomes more destructive. Once, one of your failed or successful attacks becomes a critical hit, and your weapon or unarmed attack gains the deadly d12 trait for&nbsp;this attack, replacing any deadly trait it already had. Rovagug typically grants this boon when the critical hit could destroy something precious or significant.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You can devour all. You mouth grows into a horrible circular, insectile maw of needle-like teeth. You gain a bite unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage. Additionally, you can stomach eating anything you can fit down your throat&mdash;even rocks or small objects. You gain a +4 status bonus to saves resulting from eating something, such as diseases, poisons, or other effects of the ingested object.

These texts claim that in time before time, in a world not yet created, Asmodeus and his brother Ihys were among the first gods in existence. During these unnamed ages, the two gods quarreled over the fate of the souls of their creations, and Asmodeus slew his brother. Confident that Ihys&rsquo;s act of granting mortals free will was folly, Asmodeus made his own convictions known: that existence is best served by absolute order and discipline.

Once, for 1 minute, whenever you take slashing, piercing, or bleed damage, chains rip forth from your body, affecting creatures in a line from your position in the direction of the attack (or in the direction of your choice for bleed damage or if you deal the damage yourself) with the effect of a grim tendrils spell whose level is equal to half your level rounded up, and whose DC is your highest spell DC (or 10 + your level + your Wisdom modifier if you have no spell DC).<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Each morning, during your daily preparations, scars gather into words on your flesh.

You lose that which you cherish the most forever, and lose the ability to feel joy. You can&rsquo;t gain benefits from emotion effects based on positive emotions.

Whether the attack deals bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage depends on the mutation. If the unarmed Strike replaces a limb, you can still use the mutated limb for its original functions.

Shelyn typically grants this boon only when the Diplomacy check would serve to increase love or offer a chance of redemption.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You are inspired to create great works and become a virtuoso at all arts. You gain the Specialty Crafting feat and the Virtuoso Performer feat in all categories of Crafting and Performance.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Your inner beauty and love surround you in an aura. As long as you bear them no ill will, all creatures other than fiends, undead, and mindless creatures start with an attitude of friendly toward you, unless they would have been helpful instead. This doesn&rsquo;t mean they are willing to change their life or plans for you, and this boon does not prevent their attitudes from worsening if you try to thwart them. This effect doesn&rsquo;t work against deities and similarly powerful creatures. Additionally, the love you share with your friends inspires them. You and your allies gain a +3 status bonus to saving throws and skill checks as long as you can see each other.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: You heart churns with remorse. Each day, you are sickened 1 as a specific misdeed plays out in your mind over and over in guilt. You can&rsquo;t remove this condition, though it abates enough for you to quickly eat and drink when necessary. If you make amends or otherwise earnestly pursue redemption for the misdeed, the sickened condition fades completely that day.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Others subconsciously recognize your past betrayals. Whenever you attempt a Diplomacy check and roll a failure, you get a critical failure instead, and if you roll a critical success, you get a success instead.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Those who spread misery via false love face Shelyn&rsquo;s greatest curse. You lose the ability to distinguish any living being from another through appearance, voice, scent, or similar sensory means.

Eschewing crusades and other ventures that take his followers away from their homes, Erastil watches over those who devote their lives to family and community. He is primarily an agricultural deity, specifically focusing on those aspects of nature that either can be tamed or are of use to his followers. His domain encompasses the plants and animals that farmers, hunters, and ranchers deal with in their everyday lives.

When you attack with a longbow, you can ignore the longbow&rsquo;s volley trait, and longbows have double the normal range increment for you.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You become a friend to the land.

He avoids bestowing misfortune as punishment, preferring to do so only to give an individual a challenging obstacle to overcome to help them progress in their quest for self-perfection.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Irori grants you great insight and knowledge. Once, when you roll a failure at a check to Recall Knowledge, you get a critical success instead. Furthermore, the check loses the secret trait, so you know for sure that the result was a critical success. Irori typically grants this boon for an extremely consequential check to Recall&nbsp;Knowledge.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Your body rebuilds after adversity, becoming stronger. You can cast wholeness of body as an occult ki spell. If you didn&rsquo;t have one already, you gain a focus pool with 1 Focus Point and are trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs (the sidebar on the &lt;classes%8%%&gt;monk class page has full information on what happens when you gain your first ki spell).<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You can temporarily ascend to a greater form. You can cast 8th-level righteous might once per day as an occult innate spell. When you do, your form appears unremarkable, rather than clad in powerful armaments.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Irori challenges you to seek another path, rather than treat every problem as a nail just because you have a hammer. If you select a check for which you have a higher bonus when another method would have been more appropriate for the situation, such as using Deception to lie through life because it&rsquo;s your highest modifier, even if it would be better to reach a compromise through Diplomacy, you must roll twice and take the lower result.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Irori challenges you to adapt to adversity in order to perfect yourself. You become weighed down as if under heavy weights, becoming clumsy 2 and encumbered until you accomplish a challenging task of Irori&rsquo;s choosing.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Irori makes all living creatures forget your existence. This can be further compounded by raising Irori&rsquo;s ire, resulting in your name being obliterated from all written records.

While the other dwarven gods represent specific areas of dwarven life and culture, thus forming an expansive and comprehensive dwarven pantheon, Torag’s areas of concern are those most central to dwarven society. In his own family, Torag models the values of community and protection that have cemented deep-rooted relationships among dwarven clans. His focus on strategy and tactical acumen centers on protection, reflected in dwarves’ impenetrable fortresses and conservative military tactics, including their willingness to use offensive maneuvers as a form of defense. He also represents the forge: the creation of fine works from raw materials, practice and mastery of a craft, and pride in one’s work. His purview extends even to those activities that feed the forge and dwarven artisanship, such as mining the earth for raw ore and gemstones. Torag’s oversight over these core concepts has secured his place at the head of the dwarven pantheon for ages. It was Torag who sent the dwarves on their legendary Quest for Sky during the Age of Darkness, and his worship was long-established even then. Indeed, among dwarves, Torag is often called the Father of Creation.<br><br><strong>Edicts</strong> be honorable and forthright, keep your word, respect the forge, serve your people<br><strong>Anathema</strong> tell lies or cheat someone, intentionally create inferior works, show mercy to the enemies of your people<br><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> forge, protection, and strategy<br><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, LN</span><br></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Constitution or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Crafting</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>warhammer</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>creation, earth, family, protection</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>duty</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: mindlink, 3rd: earthbind, 4th: creation</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Torag makes his pleasure or displeasure known through unsubtle signs.<br><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Torag repairs your equipment so you may continue your vigil. Once, a shield, weapon, or other item you hold or are wearing recovers all of its Hit Points. The item’s Hardness doubles for 1 minute. Torag can grant this boon just as the item would have been destroyed, preventing the item’s destruction. Occasionally, he grants this boon to restore an item important to dwarven history that has already been fully destroyed.<br><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You are counted as family among Torag and his followers. You gain the effects of a single dwarf ancestry feat of Torag’s choice, even if you are not a dwarf, as long as you maintain Torag’s blessing.<br><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Standing watch or guarding a location counts as resting for you, preventing you from being fatigued due to lack of rest as long as you stand watch for at least 6 hours a day. You can recover your Focus Points (if you have them) by standing guard in addition to any other options you have available. When on guard, you gain a +4 status bonus to Perception to notice ambushes and other dangers approaching. As long as you are holding a shield, you are always Defending during exploration without needing to move at half your travel speed, and you can perform another exploration activity as well. While you are using a shield, its Hardness increases by 5.<br><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Shoddy artisanship makes itself known. Whenever an item you’re using takes damage, it is broken.<br><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: You must prove your skills at a craft by providing your own equipment. You gain item bonuses only from items you make yourself.<br><strong>Major Curse</strong>: You are forever cast out from your home. Members of your community have their attitudes towards you shift two steps worse, meaning those who used to be helpful are now indifferent, those who were friendly are now unfriendly, and all others are now hostile.

All animals and nonsapient plant creatures are hostile to you, and any animal companion or familiar abandons you.

In particular, Cayden blesses the recently liberated to help secure their freedom. Cayden is also known to grant particularly trivial and harmless curses to those who disrupt revelry. These curses typically cause the disruptor to change in appearance, taking on a comical or farcical look. He is quick to lift these curses by dawn or for those who give in to the enjoyment of the evening and join the festivities.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Cayden Cailean helps you recover from nights of carousing.

She watches over city gates, helping keep invaders out and defenders safe. She also watches over those moving into a new stage in life, whether that means a birthday, a marriage, or a more fitting body. It is common for anyone entering into a life change, such as moving to a new town or changing careers, to look to Alseta for guidance. Likewise, birth and death are both transitions, and expectant mothers and the bereaved both offer her prayers, linking Alseta&rsquo;s church to that of @Compendium[pf2e.deities.QZD0u1jxwz0kj8uI]{Pharasma}. Some consider Alseta to be the goddess of teleportation, though she does not officially claim that title.

After defeating and consuming rival spirits of battle, gold, and wood, she became a minor god of piracy, strife, and sea monsters.<br /><br />Besmara, the Pirate Queen, cuts a brash and bold figure, as she often is depicted wearing buccaneer apparel consisting of loose-fitting, eye-catching clothing and black boots, and her hair is wind-tossed on even the calmest day. She and her followers adhere to a simple code of greed: take what you desire, no matter who it might belong to. Despite this, Besmara and her worshippers are generally loyal to one another, knowing that while on the waves raiding ships for treasure, a pirate crew can survive only if its members trust one another.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> sail the seas, stay loyal to captain and crew, take what you want<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> betray shipmates, forsake piracy, settle on land<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> piracy, sea monsters, and strife<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> CG, CN, CE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Dexterity or Constitution</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm or heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Athletics</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>rapier</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>destruction, trickery, water, wealth</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: hydraulic push, 3rd: feet to fins, 5th: mariner's curse</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Due to her fiery temperament, the Pirate Queen is quick to punish or reward her followers, and is equally fast at rescinding her favor or forgiving transgressions.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Besmara wants you to amuse her, placing both plunder and peril in your path. This intercession often takes the form of an unexpected treasure map, a message in a bottle, or some other sign leading you to a great reward, assuming you can handle the challenges along the way.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You are at home on the seas and always ready to plunder an enemy vessel or defend your own. When aboard a boat, you gain a +2 status bonus to all initiative rolls, Acrobatics checks to Balance, and Athletics checks to Climb. In addition, you never get seasick.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You seem to be unaffected by storms. You ignore all effects and penalties caused by precipitation and winds, and you can see normally through fog, rain, and other weather conditions.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: You feel some of the effects of scurvy, making your wounds flow more easily. The DC of the flat check for you to remove persistent bleed damage is 20 instead of 15 (or 15 instead of 10 if using extremely efficient methods to assist your recovery), and you don&rsquo;t recover from persistent bleed damage automatically when you reach full Hit Points.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: You get seasick, becoming sickened 2 whenever you can see the sea or are on a boat at sea. You can&rsquo;t reduce this condition until you can no longer see the sea or are off the boat, though you can manage to stomach enough food and water to survive on a voyage, with extreme discomfort.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: You meet extreme financial ruin for daring to gravely offend the Pirate Queen. Besmara&rsquo;s agents steal all your booty and bring the spoils to Besmara&rsquo;s ship, Seawraith. If you want a chance to recover your lost wealth, you must parlay with the goddess and accept whatever dangerous terms she offers, usually requiring a heist she will find sufficiently amusing to watch whether you succeed or fail, and requiring you to trade your spoils from that quest for your previous belongings.</span></p>","_id":"wkDOeK7ENz1ra8IC"}

Often called Desna&rsquo;s Shadow, the Black Butterfly is sometimes believed to be an aspect of Desna that has broken off and taken on its own life; her interest in distance and space certainly reflects Desna&rsquo;s love of travel. The Black Butterfly finds the silence of the sea of stars useful for introspection and learning about oneself. Those who follow her take opportunities when they can to sit in silent meditation, in zones of silence and darkness when possible. Travel across large distances offers plenty to think about and contemplate, and the Black Butterfly encourages such journeys. She hates all evil, but she truly despises the powerful beings of evil that populate the Dark Tapestry, and her followers are expected to fight these beings and their followers without mercy.<br /><br />The Silence Between manifests as the silhouette of a woman with butterfly wings, and white hair and eyes. Her wings contain a shadow&mdash;or reflection&mdash;of all of the Dark Tapestry and everything within it. Parted lovers, the isolated, the introverted, those who have sworn vows of silence or don&rsquo;t communicate verbally, stargazers, explorers, and the melancholy are all found among the followers of the Black Butterfly.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> Study the stars, notice moments of silence, perform anonymous acts of kindness<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> Disrupt another&rsquo;s meditation, interrupt tranquil moments, play noisy or discordant music<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> distance, silence, and space<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, CG</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Dexterity or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Stealth</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>starknife</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>freedom, secrecy, star, void</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: penumbral shroud, 2nd: blur, 4th: blink</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","_id":"c9NFjRR8gr6CWpjl"}

Abadaran priests living in cities often serve as judges, lawyers, and clerks, while those who live on the frontier work as roving magistrates, acting as judge, jury, and executioners in the name of order. <br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> bring civilization to the frontiers, earn wealth through hard work and trade, follow the rule of law<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> engage in banditry or piracy, steal, undermine a law-abiding court<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> cities, law, merchants, and wealth<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, LN, LE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Constitution or Intelligence</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm or heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Society</div>\n<div><strong>Favored </strong><strong>Weapon</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.62nnVQvGhoVLLl2K]{Crossbow}</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> cities, earth, travel, wealth</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>duty</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.2oH5IufzdESuYxat]{Illusory Object}, 4th: @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.TUj8eugNqAvB1vVR]{Creation}, 7th: @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.vPWMEyVTreMOoFnm]{Magnificent Mansion}</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Abadar&rsquo;s gifts take the form of riches, while his ire tends to cause offenders to lose wealth.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Abadar warns his favored against those who might unfairly take advantage. Once, when someone rolls a success on a Deception check to Lie maliciously to&nbsp;you and you alone, they get a critical failure instead. Abadar typically chooses to grant this boon in response to an extremely consequential lie.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Abadar blesses all your enterprises, leading to financial success as all your ventures always seems to work out. If you roll a critical failure at a check to Earn Income, you get a failure instead. If you roll a success on a check to Earn Income, you earn twice the usual amount of income.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Your silver tongue is infallible, allowing you to reach a compromise if one is even remotely possible. Once per day, you know just what to offer to make a deal or broker a negotiation, and if you offer your divinely inspired deal, you can automatically receive a result of 20 + your Diplomacy modifier&nbsp;on your Diplomacy check instead of rolling. This does not increase your degree of success like rolling a 20 would. If there is legitimately nothing you could offer to reach an agreement, you learn that, and you don&rsquo;t expend your daily use of the boon.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Any time you steal, illegally harm or kill another creature, or undermine a law-abiding officer or court, a symbol or word describing your crime appears on a visible spot on your skin. This symbol cannot be removed or hidden with makeup (though it can be covered with clothing) and it doesn&rsquo;t vanish until you make legal restitution for the crime, such as by serving your sentence.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Abadar curses all your enterprises, leading to financial disaster as all your ventures always seem to fail. The result of your check to Earn Income is always one degree of success worse than the one you rolled.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: You become honest to a fault. You constantly suffer the critical failure effect of zone of truth. Additionally, you are always offered the worst possible option in a bargain.</span></p>"}
