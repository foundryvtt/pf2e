The Mother of Monsters readily accepts mortals into her fold and has made it her goal to twist mortal life toward her abhorrent ideals. Her intervention is widely known to inflict corruptions and terrible nightmares.

You gain either an unarmed Strike that deals 1d6 damage or one that deals 1d4 damage and has the finesse and agile traits. Whether the attack deals bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage depends on the mutation. If the unarmed Strike replaces a limb, you can still use the mutated limb for its original functions. Lamashtu chooses the form and function of your mutation.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You spread Lamashtu&rsquo;s nightmares everywhere you go. You can cast confusion once&nbsp;per day as an divine innate spell.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Lamashtu uses your body to birth a new monster, regardless of your gender. Once per day, you can spend 1 minute to birth a monster determined by the GM, which rips its way from your belly. The monster&rsquo;s level is up to your level and it does as it pleases, following Lamashtu&rsquo;s will, though it doesn&rsquo;t attack you unless you have lost her favor. You are drained 3 from the ordeal.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Horrid visions torment your mind, overlaying reality at inopportune times. You treat everything around you as if it was concealed.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Lamashtu marks you as prey. Any creature with imprecise or better scent can smell you from 100 &times; the usual range of their scent and can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that you smell like prey, so they might attack you even if they would normally avoid attacking creatures of your ancestry. This smell doesn&rsquo;t magically compel their action, and the scent of prey doesn&rsquo;t overcome a deeper bond such as that with an animal companion.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Your dreams are an unending stream of nightmares. You need 16 hours of rest to try to get enough sleep to recover resources in daily preparation that normally require an 8-hour rest, and even then, you must succeed at a DC 15 flat check to do so, and you are still fatigued on a successful check.</p>","_id":"aipkJQxP4GBsTaGq"}

If Asmodeus&rsquo;s own scriptures are to believed&mdash;and they are corroborated by certain other accounts, like the angel-penned <em>Book of the Damned</em>&mdash;he is one of the oldest beings of the multiverse. These texts claim that in time before time, in a world not yet created, Asmodeus and his brother Ihys were among the first gods in existence. During these unnamed ages, the two gods quarreled over the fate of the souls of their creations, and Asmodeus slew his brother. Confident that Ihys&rsquo;s act of granting mortals free will was folly, Asmodeus made his own convictions known: that existence is best served by absolute order and discipline. These claims contradict other popular creation myths, and both theologians and immortal agents of the gods doubt Asmodeus&rsquo;s claims to varying degrees, but while there is no evidence to prove them, they are also difficult to refute.</span><br /><br /><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><strong>Edicts</strong> negotiate contracts to your best advantage, rule tyrannically and torture weaker beings, show subservience to your betters<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> break a contract, free a slave, insult Asmodeus by showing mercy to your enemies<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> contracts, pride, slavery, and tyranny <br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> any, though characters who commit themselves to Asmodeus this way have their souls bound to the Dark Prince for all eternity</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Deception</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>mace</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>confidence, fire, trickery, tyranny</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>duty, glyph</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: charm, 4th: suggestion, 6th: mislead</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Asmodeus tends to offer his gifts to entice those on the precipice of yielding to his vile temptations.

Once, when you fail at the Diplomacy check to make a significant or consequential Request, you can cast suggestion on the target of your Request, suggesting the same course of action. This is a divine innate spell.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Your eyes glow red like embers and your skin takes on a crimson tone. You gain darkvision and&nbsp;fire resistance 5.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Asmodeus helps enforce your bargains and contracts. When a creature enters a bargain or contract with you, uncoerced and of its own free will, it can&rsquo;t voluntarily violate its side of the bargain as long as you uphold your side. You can always choose to violate the bargain yourself, but if you do, the creature is no longer bound to fulfill its part.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Asmodeus&rsquo;s flames burn you with great malice.

In his mortal years, Cayden was a sellsword of no small fame, known for his boisterous manner, skill with a blade, and fearless resolve. During a particularly rowdy night of drinking, a series of escalating dares led the wandering mercenary to attempt the Test of the Starstone. He emerged from the Starstone Cathedral 3 days later, laughing, a fully realized god. Divine responsibility did little to change Cayden&rsquo;s attitude from what it was in his mortal life. He continues to crave adventure, drink, and pleasurable company while abhorring bullies, tyrants, and cowards.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> drink, free slaves and aid the oppressed, seek glory and adventure<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> waste alcohol, be mean or standoffish when drunk, own a slave<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> ale, bravery, freedom, and wine<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, CG, CN</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Constitution or Charisma</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill A</strong>thletics</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>rapier</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>cities, freedom, indulgence, might</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: fleet step, 2nd: touch of idiocy, 5th: hallucination</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Cayden sometimes hands out his blessings and communicates his ire at seemingly random opportunities based on his drunken whims. In particular, Cayden blesses the recently liberated to help secure their freedom. Cayden is also known to grant particularly trivial and harmless curses to those who disrupt revelry. These curses typically cause the disruptor to change in appearance, taking on a comical or farcical look. He is quick to lift these curses by dawn or for those who give in to the enjoyment of the evening and join the festivities.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Cayden Cailean helps you recover from nights of carousing. While you still get drunk and otherwise experience the effects of alcohol normally, you are never hung over the next morning.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You share some of the bravery Cayden espoused during his ascension.

In his mortal years, Cayden was a sellsword of no small fame, known for his boisterous manner, skill with a blade, and fearless resolve. During a particularly rowdy night of drinking, a series of escalating dares led the wandering mercenary to attempt the Test of the Starstone. He emerged from the Starstone Cathedral 3 days later, laughing, a fully realized god. Divine responsibility did little to change Cayden&rsquo;s attitude from what it was in his mortal life. He continues to crave adventure, drink, and pleasurable company while abhorring bullies, tyrants, and cowards.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> drink, free slaves and aid the oppressed, seek glory and adventure<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> waste alcohol, be mean or standoffish when drunk, own a slave<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> ale, bravery, freedom, and wine<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, CG, CN</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Constitution or Charisma</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill A</strong>thletics</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>rapier</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>cities, freedom, indulgence, might</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: fleet step, 2nd: touch of idiocy, 5th: hallucination</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Cayden sometimes hands out his blessings and communicates his ire at seemingly random opportunities based on his drunken whims. In particular, Cayden blesses the recently liberated to help secure their freedom. Cayden is also known to grant particularly trivial and harmless curses to those who disrupt revelry. These curses typically cause the disruptor to change in appearance, taking on a comical or farcical look. He is quick to lift these curses by dawn or for those who give in to the enjoyment of the evening and join the festivities.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Cayden Cailean helps you recover from nights of carousing.

Abadar typically chooses to grant this boon in response to an extremely consequential lie.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Abadar blesses all your enterprises, leading to financial success as all your ventures always seems to work out.

The result of your check to Earn Income is always one degree of success worse than the one you rolled.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: You become honest to a fault.

If Asmodeus&rsquo;s own scriptures are to believed&mdash;and they are corroborated by certain other accounts, like the angel-penned <em>Book of the Damned</em>&mdash;he is one of the oldest beings of the multiverse. These texts claim that in time before time, in a world not yet created, Asmodeus and his brother Ihys were among the first gods in existence. During these unnamed ages, the two gods quarreled over the fate of the souls of their creations, and Asmodeus slew his brother. Confident that Ihys&rsquo;s act of granting mortals free will was folly, Asmodeus made his own convictions known: that existence is best served by absolute order and discipline. These claims contradict other popular creation myths, and both theologians and immortal agents of the gods doubt Asmodeus&rsquo;s claims to varying degrees, but while there is no evidence to prove them, they are also difficult to refute.</span><br /><br /><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><strong>Edicts</strong> negotiate contracts to your best advantage, rule tyrannically and torture weaker beings, show subservience to your betters<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> break a contract, free a slave, insult Asmodeus by showing mercy to your enemies<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> contracts, pride, slavery, and tyranny <br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> any, though characters who commit themselves to Asmodeus this way have their souls bound to the Dark Prince for all eternity</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Deception</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>mace</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>confidence, fire, trickery, tyranny</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>duty, glyph</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: charm, 4th: suggestion, 6th: mislead</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Asmodeus tends to offer his gifts to entice those on the precipice of yielding to his vile temptations.

Once, when you fail at the Diplomacy check to make a significant or consequential Request, you can cast suggestion on the target of your Request, suggesting the same course of action.

When a creature enters a bargain or contract with you, uncoerced and of its own free will, it can&rsquo;t voluntarily violate its side of the bargain as long as you uphold your side. You can always choose to violate the bargain yourself, but if you do, the creature is no longer bound to fulfill its part.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Asmodeus&rsquo;s flames burn you with great malice.

{"_id":"AlL9GtlTldbqNoVm","name":"Calistria","permission":{"default":0,"EIsZy66qzkE5qFsM":3},"folder":"","flags":{},"content":"<h1 class=\"title\">Calistria (The Savored Sting) [CN]</h1>\n<p class=\"title\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><img class=\"thumbnail\" style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Images/Deities/Calistria.png\" width=\"119\" height=\"119\" /><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">As symbolized by the three daggers of her religious symbol, Calistria has three aspects: lust, revenge, and trickery. Silver-tongued and charming, she is a master of weaving insults into compliments and laying intricate groundwork for retribution at its finest. She is a goddess of vengeance, but it would be a mistake to assume that means she pursues justice. Calistria is fickle, shifting her loyalties and interests as her whims take her&mdash;though she never forgets a slight, and any who think she has forgiven will surely find it is only a matter of time before they are targeted by a long-term plot of revenge to lay them thoroughly low.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> pursue your personal freedom, seek hedonistic thrills, take revenge<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> become too consumed by love or a need for revenge, let a slight go unanswered<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> lust, revenge, and trickery<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> CG, CN, CE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Dexterity or Charisma</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm or heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Deception</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>whip</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>pain, passion, secrecy, trickery</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: charm, 3rd: enthrall, 6th: mislead</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Signs of favor or displeasure from the Savored Sting are sometimes subtle and at other times incontrovertible. Calistria typically grants her boon to those on the path toward great vengeance and curses those who slight her followers, particularly if those followers are sex workers, though her fickle heart rarely commits to any absolute guidelines.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Calistria smiles on the riskiest deceptions. Once, when you roll a failure on a check to Lie, you get a critical success instead. Calistria typically grants this boon for an extremely consequential lie.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: A foot-long wasp finds and befriends you. It serves you as a familiar as long as you maintain Calistria&rsquo;s grace. The wasp always has the burrower and flier familiar abilities.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Calistria guides you towards vengeance. You always know the direction and distance towards the nearest creature that has wronged you and thus far gone unpunished.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Whenever a new person desires vengeance against you, you suffer a painful sting and are afflicted with giant wasp venom at stage 1.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: People react as though you&rsquo;re insulting them, even in normal conversation. Whenever you attempt to Make an Impression, the outcome is one degree of success worse than the result of your roll. If you converse with someone over a long enough period of time but don&rsquo;t attempt to Make an Impression, you still insult them, and you suffer the effect of a critical failure to Make an Impression.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: You have wronged those unable to obtain revenge for themselves, and Calistria&rsquo;s curse grants their revenge its own life. Whenever another creature imagines vengeance upon you but can&rsquo;t pursue that vengeance because you are too powerful, well connected, or otherwise untouchable, a creature of roughly your level manifests out of their imagination and performs their desired revenge. Once the revenge is complete or the manifestation is destroyed, the summoned creature vanishes from existence.</span></p>"}

In his mortal years, Cayden was a sellsword of no small fame, known for his boisterous manner, skill with a blade, and fearless resolve. During a particularly rowdy night of drinking, a series of escalating dares led the wandering mercenary to attempt the Test of the Starstone. He emerged from the Starstone Cathedral 3 days later, laughing, a fully realized god. Divine responsibility did little to change Cayden&rsquo;s attitude from what it was in his mortal life. He continues to crave adventure, drink, and pleasurable company while abhorring bullies, tyrants, and cowards.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> drink, free slaves and aid the oppressed, seek glory and adventure<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> waste alcohol, be mean or standoffish when drunk, own a slave<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> ale, bravery, freedom, and wine<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, CG, CN</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Constitution or Charisma</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill A</strong>thletics</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>rapier</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>cities, freedom, indulgence, might</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: fleet step, 2nd: touch of idiocy, 5th: hallucination</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Cayden sometimes hands out his blessings and communicates his ire at seemingly random opportunities based on his drunken whims. In particular, Cayden blesses the recently liberated to help secure their freedom. Cayden is also known to grant particularly trivial and harmless curses to those who disrupt revelry. These curses typically cause the disruptor to change in appearance, taking on a comical or farcical look. He is quick to lift these curses by dawn or for those who give in to the enjoyment of the evening and join the festivities.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Cayden Cailean helps you recover from nights of carousing. While you still get drunk and otherwise experience the effects of alcohol normally, you are never hung over the next morning.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You share some of the bravery Cayden espoused during his ascension. When you roll a success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. If you have the fighter bravery class feature, when you roll a critical failure on a save against a fear effect, you get a failure instead.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: An embodiment of freedom, you break fetters with ease. At the end of each of your turns, you can end one effect that is currently making you immobilized (including effects that make you immobilized by grabbing or restraining you) as a free action.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Individuals who raise Cayden&rsquo;s passing displeasure awake as if from a hard night of drinking and find that drink tastes foul.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Cayden has afflicted you with cowardice. Whenever you roll a critical success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a success instead, and each time you roll a failure on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical failure instead.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Cayden curses you to suffer in the presence of drinking, making it hard for you to bear entering any tavern. Whenever any creature drinks alcohol within 100 feet of you, you suffer all negative effects from the alcohol (but only the alcohol) instead. This doesn&rsquo;t apply if the creature gains any special effect from drinking alcohol.</span></p>"}

While the other gods toiled away to create the world, she set her sights on the heavens, placing each star in the sky. After surveying her artistry, she hung the brightest star high in the north and made it her home.

Once, after you rest, you completely recover all Hit Points, remove all negative conditions, and become free of any curses or diseases.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Desna twists fortune in your favor. Once per day, after determining the result of a check, you can reroll the check and take the new result.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Desna bestows you with a swirling cloud of lights that forms a pair of wondrous butterfly wings. These wings grant you a fly Speed of 40 feet and shine dim light to a range of 20 feet.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: You always seem to lose your way or have strange mishaps on the road that delay your travel. You (and thus any group that travels with you) travel at only 3/4 normal exploration Speed, before taking into account the terrain and other features that might slow you down further.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Misfortune follows you in your travels and requires acts of contrition or benevolence to keep at bay. You must always roll twice and take the worst result when attempting a check. This is a misfortune effect. You can express your remorse and ignore this effect for 1d4 rounds by spending an action, which has the concentrate trait. If&nbsp;you perform a truly selfless act of compassion, you ignore this effect for 1 day.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: The stars rebuke you for your ways.

Eschewing crusades and other ventures that take his followers away from their homes, Erastil watches over those who devote their lives to family and community. He is primarily an agricultural deity, specifically focusing on those aspects of nature that either can be tamed or are of use to his followers. His domain encompasses the plants and animals that farmers, hunters, and ranchers deal with in their everyday lives. While he is a protective deity, Erastil steps in only when quiet, pastoral lives are threatened. He desires his followers to live their lives in peace, with no risk of being conscripted into armies, devoured by monsters, or destroyed by magic.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> care for your home and family, fulfill your duties, keep the peace, protect the community<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> abandon your home in its time of need, choose yourself over your community, tarnish your reputation, tell lies<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> family, farming, hunting, and trade<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, NG, LN</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Constitution or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Survival</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>longbow</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>earth, family, nature, wealth</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>duty</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: true strike, 3rd: wall of thorns, 5th: tree stride</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Erastil favors those who commit themselves to their communities and detests those who disrupt these families.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Erastil shares in his bounty as long as you work for it. Whenever you roll a critical failure at a check to Subsist in the wild, you get a failure instead.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You share Erastil&rsquo;s sharp eye, allowing you to use a longbow in any situation. When you attack with a longbow, you can ignore the longbow&rsquo;s volley trait, and longbows have double the normal range increment for you.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You become a friend to the land. You can cast speak with plants as a divine innate spell. When you are in a healthy natural environment, the land sustains you without need for food or drink. You can cast the commune with nature ritual without any secondary casters or secondary checks.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Erastil curses your table and punishes you for relying on others&rsquo; hard work. Any food you didn&rsquo;t grow, gather, or otherwise harvest yourself tastes like ash and leaves you fatigued.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Erastil&rsquo;s beasts take a dislike to you. Animals&rsquo; attitudes toward you are one category worse (friendly instead of helpful, indifferent instead of friendly, and so on).<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Erastil leaves you unable to have children (or otherwise reproduce or propagate if you do so in a different manner).

Eschewing crusades and other ventures that take his followers away from their homes, Erastil watches over those who devote their lives to family and community. He is primarily an agricultural deity, specifically focusing on those aspects of nature that either can be tamed or are of use to his followers. His domain encompasses the plants and animals that farmers, hunters, and ranchers deal with in their everyday lives. While he is a protective deity, Erastil steps in only when quiet, pastoral lives are threatened. He desires his followers to live their lives in peace, with no risk of being conscripted into armies, devoured by monsters, or destroyed by magic.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> care for your home and family, fulfill your duties, keep the peace, protect the community<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> abandon your home in its time of need, choose yourself over your community, tarnish your reputation, tell lies<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> family, farming, hunting, and trade<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, NG, LN</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Constitution or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Survival</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>longbow</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>earth, family, nature, wealth</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>duty</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: true strike, 3rd: wall of thorns, 5th: tree stride</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Erastil favors those who commit themselves to their communities and detests those who disrupt these families.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Erastil shares in his bounty as long as you work for it. Whenever you roll a critical failure at a check to Subsist in the wild, you get a failure instead.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You share Erastil&rsquo;s sharp eye, allowing you to use a longbow in any situation. When you attack with a longbow, you can ignore the longbow&rsquo;s volley trait, and longbows have double the normal range increment for you.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You become a friend to the land. You can cast speak with plants as a divine innate spell. When you are in a healthy natural environment, the land sustains you without need for food or drink. You can cast the commune with nature ritual without any secondary casters or secondary checks.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Erastil curses your table and punishes you for relying on others&rsquo; hard work. Any food you didn&rsquo;t grow, gather, or otherwise harvest yourself tastes like ash and leaves you fatigued.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Erastil&rsquo;s beasts take a dislike to you. Animals&rsquo; attitudes toward you are one category worse (friendly instead of helpful, indifferent instead of friendly, and so on).<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Erastil leaves you unable to have children (or otherwise reproduce or propagate if you do so in a different manner). This curse also affects your livestock, pets, and crops.</span></p>"}

Sailors drop boxes of cargo as offerings to avoid a fatal storm, hoping to please the Wind and the Waves, even though they know that such pleas are far more likely to go unnoticed as they are to draw their deity&rsquo;s attention. The deity&rsquo;s temperament is fickle and their fury swift, hurling bolts of lightning and dragging to the crushing depths those who dare befoul the natural world.

All animals and nonsapient plant creatures are hostile to you, and any animal companion or familiar abandons you. Sapient plants&rsquo; attitude toward you begins two categories worse than normal, as something about you seems repugnant to them.

If you didn&rsquo;t have one already, you gain a focus pool with 1 Focus Point and are trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs (the sidebar on the &lt;classes%8%%&gt;monk class page has full information on what happens when you gain your first ki spell).<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You can temporarily ascend to a greater form. You can cast 8th-level righteous might once per day as an occult innate spell. When you do, your form appears unremarkable, rather than clad in powerful armaments.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Irori challenges you to seek another path, rather than treat every problem as a nail just because you have a hammer. If you select a check for which you have a higher bonus when another method would have been more appropriate for the situation, such as using Deception to lie through life because it&rsquo;s your highest modifier, even if it would be better to reach a compromise through Diplomacy, you must roll twice and take the lower result.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Irori challenges you to adapt to adversity in order to perfect yourself. You become weighed down as if under heavy weights, becoming clumsy 2 and encumbered until you accomplish a challenging task of Irori&rsquo;s choosing.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Irori makes all living creatures forget your existence. This can be further compounded by raising Irori&rsquo;s ire, resulting in your name being obliterated from all written records. In both cases, memories and writings rearrange themselves to omit you smoothly, rather than leaving obvious gaps.&lt;/classes%8%%&gt;</span></p>"}

Abadar&rsquo;s cathedral-banks are found in many cities and places where order thrives or is gaining a foothold. Aristocrats, city guards, merchants, and those working in legal practice or who have the well-being of their community on their mind are common worshippers of the god of cities, along with dwarves in general. Abadaran priests living in cities often serve as judges, lawyers, and clerks, while those who live on the frontier work as roving magistrates, acting as judge, jury, and executioners in the name of order. <br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> bring civilization to the frontiers, earn wealth through hard work and trade, follow the rule of law<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> engage in banditry or piracy, steal, undermine a law-abiding court<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> cities, law, merchants, and wealth<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, LN, LE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Constitution or Intelligence</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm or heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Society</div>\n<div><strong>Favored </strong><strong>Weapon</strong> crossbow</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> cities, earth, travel, wealth</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>duty</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: illusory object, 4th: creation, 7th: magnificent mansion</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Abadar&rsquo;s gifts take the form of riches, while his ire tends to cause offenders to lose wealth.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Abadar warns his favored against those who might unfairly take advantage. Once, when someone rolls a success on a Deception check to Lie maliciously to&nbsp;you and you alone, they get a critical failure instead. Abadar typically chooses to grant this boon in response to an extremely consequential lie.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Abadar blesses all your enterprises, leading to financial success as all your ventures always seems to work out. If you roll a critical failure at a check to Earn Income, you get a failure instead. If you roll a success on a check to Earn Income, you earn twice the usual amount of income.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Your silver tongue is infallible, allowing you to reach a compromise if one is even remotely possible. Once per day, you know just what to offer to make a deal or broker a negotiation, and if you offer your divinely inspired deal, you can automatically receive a result of 20 + your Diplomacy modifier&nbsp;on your Diplomacy check instead of rolling. This does not increase your degree of success like rolling a 20 would. If there is legitimately nothing you could offer to reach an agreement, you learn that, and you don&rsquo;t expend your daily use of the boon.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Any time you steal, illegally harm or kill another creature, or undermine a law-abiding officer or court, a symbol or word describing your crime appears on a visible spot on your skin. This symbol cannot be removed or hidden with makeup (though it can be covered with clothing) and it doesn&rsquo;t vanish until you make legal restitution for the crime, such as by serving your sentence.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Abadar curses all your enterprises, leading to financial disaster as all your ventures always seem to fail. The result of your check to Earn Income is always one degree of success worse than the one you rolled.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: You become honest to a fault. You constantly suffer the critical failure effect of zone of truth. Additionally, you are always offered the worst possible option in a bargain.</span></p>"}

If Asmodeus&rsquo;s own scriptures are to believed&mdash;and they are corroborated by certain other accounts, like the angel-penned <em>Book of the Damned</em>&mdash;he is one of the oldest beings of the multiverse. These texts claim that in time before time, in a world not yet created, Asmodeus and his brother Ihys were among the first gods in existence. During these unnamed ages, the two gods quarreled over the fate of the souls of their creations, and Asmodeus slew his brother. Confident that Ihys&rsquo;s act of granting mortals free will was folly, Asmodeus made his own convictions known: that existence is best served by absolute order and discipline. These claims contradict other popular creation myths, and both theologians and immortal agents of the gods doubt Asmodeus&rsquo;s claims to varying degrees, but while there is no evidence to prove them, they are also difficult to refute.</span><br /><br /><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><strong>Edicts</strong> negotiate contracts to your best advantage, rule tyrannically and torture weaker beings, show subservience to your betters<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> break a contract, free a slave, insult Asmodeus by showing mercy to your enemies<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> contracts, pride, slavery, and tyranny <br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> any, though characters who commit themselves to Asmodeus this way have their souls bound to the Dark Prince for all eternity</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Deception</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>mace</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>confidence, fire, trickery, tyranny</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>duty, glyph</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: charm, 4th: suggestion, 6th: mislead</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Asmodeus tends to offer his gifts to entice those on the precipice of yielding to his vile temptations. His curses come most often in response to those who break contracts in his name, or commit other personal insults.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Pleased by your talent for manipulation, Asmodeus amplifies your skills. Once, when you fail at the Diplomacy check to make a significant or consequential Request, you can cast suggestion on the target of your Request, suggesting the same course of action. This is a divine innate spell.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Your eyes glow red like embers and your skin takes on a crimson tone. You gain darkvision and&nbsp;fire resistance 5.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Asmodeus helps enforce your bargains and contracts. When a creature enters a bargain or contract with you, uncoerced and of its own free will, it can&rsquo;t voluntarily violate its side of the bargain as long as you uphold your side. You can always choose to violate the bargain yourself, but if you do, the creature is no longer bound to fulfill its part.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Asmodeus&rsquo;s flames burn you with great malice. You gain weakness 5 to fire.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Asmodeus forces your compliance. You can&rsquo;t voluntarily back out of an agreement or contract or go back on your word, though you need follow only the letter of the agreement, not the spirit.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Asmodeus has taken note of the chaos you have wrought. You receive an ancient wound that feels older than time itself. You become permanently drained 4, and nothing short of another intercession can remove the condition. Your wound aches fiercely whenever you perform a particularly chaotic act, causing you to become sickened 1.</span></p>"}

Silver-tongued and charming, she is a master of weaving insults into compliments and laying intricate groundwork for retribution at its finest. She is a goddess of vengeance, but it would be a mistake to assume that means she pursues justice. Calistria is fickle, shifting her loyalties and interests as her whims take her&mdash;though she never forgets a slight, and any who think she has forgiven will surely find it is only a matter of time before they are targeted by a long-term plot of revenge to lay them thoroughly low.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> pursue your personal freedom, seek hedonistic thrills, take revenge<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> become too consumed by love or a need for revenge, let a slight go unanswered<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> lust, revenge, and trickery<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> CG, CN, CE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Dexterity or Charisma</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm or heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Deception</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>whip</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>pain, passion, secrecy, trickery</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: charm, 3rd: enthrall, 6th: mislead</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Signs of favor or displeasure from the Savored Sting are sometimes subtle and at other times incontrovertible. Calistria typically grants her boon to those on the path toward great vengeance and curses those who slight her followers, particularly if those followers are sex workers, though her fickle heart rarely commits to any absolute guidelines.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Calistria smiles on the riskiest deceptions. Once, when you roll a failure on a check to Lie, you get a critical success instead. Calistria typically grants this boon for an extremely consequential lie.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: A foot-long wasp finds and befriends you. It serves you as a familiar as long as you maintain Calistria&rsquo;s grace. The wasp always has the burrower and flier familiar abilities.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Calistria guides you towards vengeance. You always know the direction and distance towards the nearest creature that has wronged you and thus far gone unpunished.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Whenever a new person desires vengeance against you, you suffer a painful sting and are afflicted with giant wasp venom at stage 1.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: People react as though you&rsquo;re insulting them, even in normal conversation. Whenever you attempt to Make an Impression, the outcome is one degree of success worse than the result of your roll. If you converse with someone over a long enough period of time but don&rsquo;t attempt to Make an Impression, you still insult them, and you suffer the effect of a critical failure to Make an Impression.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: You have wronged those unable to obtain revenge for themselves, and Calistria&rsquo;s curse grants their revenge its own life. Whenever another creature imagines vengeance upon you but can&rsquo;t pursue that vengeance because you are too powerful, well connected, or otherwise untouchable, a creature of roughly your level manifests out of their imagination and performs their desired revenge. Once the revenge is complete or the manifestation is destroyed, the summoned creature vanishes from existence.</span></p>"}

In his mortal years, Cayden was a sellsword of no small fame, known for his boisterous manner, skill with a blade, and fearless resolve. During a particularly rowdy night of drinking, a series of escalating dares led the wandering mercenary to attempt the Test of the Starstone. He emerged from the Starstone Cathedral 3 days later, laughing, a fully realized god. Divine responsibility did little to change Cayden&rsquo;s attitude from what it was in his mortal life. He continues to crave adventure, drink, and pleasurable company while abhorring bullies, tyrants, and cowards.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> drink, free slaves and aid the oppressed, seek glory and adventure<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> waste alcohol, be mean or standoffish when drunk, own a slave<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> ale, bravery, freedom, and wine<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, CG, CN</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Constitution or Charisma</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill A</strong>thletics</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>rapier</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>cities, freedom, indulgence, might</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: fleet step, 2nd: touch of idiocy, 5th: hallucination</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Cayden sometimes hands out his blessings and communicates his ire at seemingly random opportunities based on his drunken whims. In particular, Cayden blesses the recently liberated to help secure their freedom. Cayden is also known to grant particularly trivial and harmless curses to those who disrupt revelry. These curses typically cause the disruptor to change in appearance, taking on a comical or farcical look. He is quick to lift these curses by dawn or for those who give in to the enjoyment of the evening and join the festivities.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Cayden Cailean helps you recover from nights of carousing. While you still get drunk and otherwise experience the effects of alcohol normally, you are never hung over the next morning.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You share some of the bravery Cayden espoused during his ascension. When you roll a success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. If you have the fighter bravery class feature, when you roll a critical failure on a save against a fear effect, you get a failure instead.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: An embodiment of freedom, you break fetters with ease. At the end of each of your turns, you can end one effect that is currently making you immobilized (including effects that make you immobilized by grabbing or restraining you) as a free action.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Individuals who raise Cayden&rsquo;s passing displeasure awake as if from a hard night of drinking and find that drink tastes foul.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Cayden has afflicted you with cowardice. Whenever you roll a critical success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a success instead, and each time you roll a failure on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical failure instead.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Cayden curses you to suffer in the presence of drinking, making it hard for you to bear entering any tavern. Whenever any creature drinks alcohol within 100 feet of you, you suffer all negative effects from the alcohol (but only the alcohol) instead. This doesn&rsquo;t apply if the creature gains any special effect from drinking alcohol.</span></p>"}

Once per day, after determining the result of a check, you can reroll the check and take the new result.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Desna bestows you with a swirling cloud of lights that forms a pair of wondrous butterfly wings. These wings grant you a fly Speed of 40 feet and shine dim light to a range of 20 feet.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: You always seem to lose your way or have strange mishaps on the road that delay your travel. You (and thus any group that travels with you) travel at only 3/4 normal exploration Speed, before taking into account the terrain and other features that might slow you down further.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Misfortune follows you in your travels and requires acts of contrition or benevolence to keep at bay. You must always roll twice and take the worst result when attempting a check. This is a misfortune effect. You can express your remorse and ignore this effect for 1d4 rounds by spending an action, which has the concentrate trait. If&nbsp;you perform a truly selfless act of compassion, you ignore this effect for 1 day.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: The stars rebuke you for your ways.

Eschewing crusades and other ventures that take his followers away from their homes, Erastil watches over those who devote their lives to family and community. He is primarily an agricultural deity, specifically focusing on those aspects of nature that either can be tamed or are of use to his followers. His domain encompasses the plants and animals that farmers, hunters, and ranchers deal with in their everyday lives. While he is a protective deity, Erastil steps in only when quiet, pastoral lives are threatened.

Whenever you roll a critical failure at a check to Subsist in the wild, you get a failure instead.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You share Erastil&rsquo;s sharp eye, allowing you to use a longbow in any situation. When you attack with a longbow, you can ignore the longbow&rsquo;s volley trait, and longbows have double the normal range increment for you.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You become a friend to the land. You can cast speak with plants as a divine innate spell. When you are in a healthy natural environment, the land sustains you without need for food or drink. You can cast the commune with nature ritual without any secondary casters or secondary checks.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Erastil curses your table and punishes you for relying on others&rsquo; hard work. Any food you didn&rsquo;t grow, gather, or otherwise harvest yourself tastes like ash and leaves you fatigued.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Erastil&rsquo;s beasts take a dislike to you. Animals&rsquo; attitudes toward you are one category worse (friendly instead of helpful, indifferent instead of friendly, and so on).<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Erastil leaves you unable to have children (or otherwise reproduce or propagate if you do so in a different manner).

Such a weapon lasts only as long as you continue using it to attack, and it can&rsquo;t be sold, given away, melted for scrap iron, or the like.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Your blows become unstoppable, carrying the momentum of Gorum&rsquo;s thrill for battle. Your greatsword Strikes gain the forceful trait.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Gorum feeds you the zeal of his undying warriors, allowing you to draw upon your own life force to fight on and on without falling. Whenever you would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, you are instead healed to half your maximum Hit Points and become doomed 1 (or increase your doomed condition by 1).<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Gorum rewards cowardice with frailty. Any armor you wear and shield you wield reduces its item bonus to AC by 2 (minimum 0) and its Hardness, Hit Points, and Break Threshold by half.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: You&rsquo;ve lost the glory of slaying a worthy opponent. All of your weapon and unarmed attacks decrease their damage dice by one step, and all your attacks are nonlethal.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: You are unable to keep up with the rigors of combat.

{"name":"Nethys","permission":{"default":0,"EIsZy66qzkE5qFsM":3},"flags":{},"content":"<h1 class=\"title\">Nethys (The All-Seeing Eye) [N]</h1>\n<p class=\"title\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><img class=\"thumbnail\" style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Images/Deities/Nethys.png\" width=\"119\" height=\"119\" /><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">To some, magic is a powerful weapon. To others, it&rsquo;s a malleable tool. And to a few, it&rsquo;s a source of purpose. With an understanding of spellcasting, creatures can cause fire to erupt from their hands, call otherworldly beings to aid them, bewitch the senses, and even bring the dead back to life. The ability to reshape reality to better suit one&rsquo;s needs and desires is a powerful call that most only dream of being able to answer, and few are ever able to truly master such might.<br /><br />One such master was Nethys, who was revered as a god-king in ancient Osirion. Having sought to unlock all of the secrets and potential held within the planes and beyond, Nethys shattered his own mind from the sheer overload of knowledge to which he was exposed. Witnessing all of creation, the secrets of the universe, and the vast expanse of what has been seen and will be seen rent his mind in the same moment he elevated to the status of a god. Nethys gained unlimited power and the skill to utilize it, but at the cost of his core self and mental security. This resulted in a split soul, two sides warring within the same body. One seeks to destroy the world, to purge it through fire and ruin, and to conquer all that exists. The other attempts to protect the world, to elevate and educate, and to release it from its limits.<br /><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> seek out magical power and use it<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> pursue mundane paths over magical ones<br /><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> magic<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, LN, N, CN, NE</span><br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Wisdom or Intelligence</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>harm or heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Arcana</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>staff</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>destruction, knowledge, magic, protection</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>glyph</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: magic missile, 2nd: magic mouth, 3rd: levitate, 4th: blink, 5th: prying eye, 6th: wall of force, 7th: warp mind, 8th: maze, 9th: disjunction</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Nethys is often impartial to his followers and their wishes, so it is rare to gain a heightened favor from the god of magic. However, blatant disregard and stifling of magic will certainly earn his ire.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Nethys casts a powerful spell to help you in a pinch. Once, Nethys casts a spell 1 level higher than the highest-level spell you can cast. If you can&rsquo;t cast spells, Nethys casts a 1st-level spell to help you.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Nethys grants you insight into the secrets of magic. Add one spell from a different tradition of magic to your spell list. You still must learn it or add it to your repertoire normally.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You are granted supreme magical knowledge and mastery. If you are a prepared spellcaster, you can switch one of your prepared spells for another spell you could have prepared in that slot; if you are a spontaneous spellcaster, you can switch one of the spells in your spell repertoire for another spell you could have chosen for your repertoire instead. In either case, you make this switch by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. (If you are neither a prepared nor a spontaneous spellcaster, Nethys won&rsquo;t grant you his major boon.)<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: The secrets of magic become mentally taxing. You are permanently stupefied 1.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Your magic wars against itself like Nethys&rsquo;s dueling halves. Whenever you cast a spell, attempt a DC 11 flat check. On a failure, if your spell was harmful, you instead cast a beneficial spell of the same level on your intended targets, and if it was beneficial, you instead cast a harmful spell of the same level on your intended targets. If the spell benefited some targets and harmed others, you cast a spell of the same level that switches who benefited (for instance, changing a heal spell that harmed undead and healed the living to a harm spell&nbsp;that healed undead and harmed the living). You still lose the spell slot for the spell you were trying to cast.<br /><strong>Major Curse</strong>: Nethys severs your connection to magic. You lose all your spellcasting abilities and cannot gain any future spellcasting.</span></p>","_id":"9EKyWmjLUu42evxC"}

Unlike Iomedae&rsquo;s and Cayden Cailean&rsquo;s mortal existences, Norgorber&rsquo;s life before his ascension is a mystery; the god himself has shrouded details of his mortal life in secrecy. This is no surprise to those familiar with Norgorber&mdash;he is the master of all secrets, a calculating manipulator who cleverly and ruthlessly wields the power of hidden knowledge to achieve his own ends.

Norgorber typically chooses to grant this boon to protect an extremely consequential lie.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Your poisons are everlasting. If your Strike with a poisoned weapon critically fails, or succeeds but fails to deal slashing or piercing damage, the poison is not spent. The poison is still spent once successfully applied to a creature.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You become a living secret. You are immune to divination effects and attempts to magically alter your memory, unless you choose to be affected or those effects come from a deity, artifact, or similarly powerful source. You also can never be tricked or forced by mundane means into uttering a secret you wish to keep.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Norgorber allows thieves to get the better of you.

Psychopomp servants of Pharasma guide and safeguard newly dead souls along the River of Souls to her realm, where she judges each soul and ensures it is sent to the proper plane for its afterlife, according to its alignment and mortal deeds. Although she can see all possible fates and knows the fate of each individual, free will and choice can alter a soul&rsquo;s final destination, and she places great weight on the individual&rsquo;s actions and personal choices.

Your spells that deal positive damage to undead gain a +1 status bonus to damage per spell level, and your spells that heal the living gain a +1 status bonus to the Hit Points restored per spell level.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Pharasma keeps you alive to fulfill your fate. The GM secretly chooses a fate Pharasma knows you must fulfill. Until you fulfill this fate, any time you would die, a grave but nonfatal misfortune instead befalls you.

He has little use for one, for his sole commandment is to destroy, and his followers need no instruction in how to accomplish that. The figurative and literal monsters who worship Rovagug share their myths and legends in secret shrines and hidden caves, calling him the Rough Beast, the Imprisoned King, the Tide of Fangs, the Unmaker, and the Worldbreaker. They tell each other that each life they snuff out, each piece of art they destroy, each work of labor they bring tumbling down puts a crack in the prison that holds their god.

He is as likely to curse those who draw his attention as he is to reward them, though great enough acts of violence and destruction may earn his favor.<br /><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Your attack becomes more destructive. Once, one of your failed or successful attacks becomes a critical hit, and your weapon or unarmed attack gains the deadly d12 trait for&nbsp;this attack, replacing any deadly trait it already had. Rovagug typically grants this boon when the critical hit could destroy something precious or significant.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You can devour all. You mouth grows into a horrible circular, insectile maw of needle-like teeth. You gain a bite unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage. Additionally, you can stomach eating anything you can fit down your throat&mdash;even rocks or small objects.

Most people thank her for her kind work to channel the sun&rsquo;s power for everyone&rsquo;s safety and livelihood, and thank her clergy for granting her healing power to all who need it. Mortals look to the Dawnflower as an example of boundless love, exquisite kindness, and true patience. They pray to her to heal the sick, lift up the downtrodden, and illuminate darkness of circumstance as well as darkness of spirit.

Your attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire damage that ignores fire resistance.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: You are a voice of peace and rehabilitation. When you roll a success at a check to Request something, you get a critical success instead. In addition, all creatures other than fiends, undead, and mindless creatures allow you one chance to speak your piece and make requests before entering combat. If you or an ally ever use the time from the request to gain an advantage in an ensuing combat (for example, by casting preparatory spells, positioning for combat, or waiting out your opponent&rsquo;s preparatory spells), Sarenrae immediately revokes this boon, or possibly curses your ally.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: The sun burns you for your transgression. You receive a sunburn that causes you to become permanently clumsy 1.<br /><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: The sun shines its light on everything you say. You become unable to tell lies, and if you attempt to do so, you instead compulsively blurt out the truth on the matter in question.

Even the crudest artistic awakenings are worthy of praise in the goddess&rsquo;s eyes, as they represent an individual&rsquo;s expression of life&rsquo;s trials and triumphs. She believes every creature is worthy of love and capable of creating art in their own way. Shelyn&rsquo;s religion does not require chastity, fidelity, or a particular relationship structure, as the passion of early romance is a facet of love just as important and valid as the comfortable trust between a long-married couple.

Shelyn typically grants this boon only when the Diplomacy check would serve to increase love or offer a chance of redemption.<br /><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You are inspired to create great works and become a virtuoso at all arts. You gain the Specialty Crafting feat and the Virtuoso Performer feat in all categories of Crafting and Performance.<br /><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Your inner beauty and love surround you in an aura. As long as you bear them no ill will, all creatures other than fiends, undead, and mindless creatures start with an attitude of friendly toward you, unless they would have been helpful instead. This doesn&rsquo;t mean they are willing to change their life or plans for you, and this boon does not prevent their attitudes from worsening if you try to thwart them. This effect doesn&rsquo;t work against deities and similarly powerful creatures. Additionally, the love you share with your friends inspires them. You and your allies gain a +3 status bonus to saving throws and skill checks as long as you can see each other.<br /><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: You heart churns with remorse. Each day, you are sickened 1 as a specific misdeed plays out in your mind over and over in guilt.

You lose the ability to distinguish any living being from another through appearance, voice, scent, or similar sensory means. You can make out physical size (so you wouldn&rsquo;t mistake an ant for a horse), but nothing further.

While the other dwarven gods represent specific areas of dwarven life and culture, thus forming an expansive and comprehensive dwarven pantheon, Torag’s areas of concern are those most central to dwarven society. In his own family, Torag models the values of community and protection that have cemented deep-rooted relationships among dwarven clans. His focus on strategy and tactical acumen centers on protection, reflected in dwarves’ impenetrable fortresses and conservative military tactics, including their willingness to use offensive maneuvers as a form of defense. He also represents the forge: the creation of fine works from raw materials, practice and mastery of a craft, and pride in one’s work. His purview extends even to those activities that feed the forge and dwarven artisanship, such as mining the earth for raw ore and gemstones. Torag’s oversight over these core concepts has secured his place at the head of the dwarven pantheon for ages. It was Torag who sent the dwarves on their legendary Quest for Sky during the Age of Darkness, and his worship was long-established even then. Indeed, among dwarves, Torag is often called the Father of Creation.<br><br><strong>Edicts</strong> be honorable and forthright, keep your word, respect the forge, serve your people<br><strong>Anathema</strong> tell lies or cheat someone, intentionally create inferior works, show mercy to the enemies of your people<br><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> forge, protection, and strategy<br><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, LN</span><br></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability </strong>Constitution or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font </strong>heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Crafting</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon </strong>warhammer</div>\n<div><strong>Domains </strong>creation, earth, family, protection</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains </strong>duty</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells </strong>1st: mindlink, 3rd: earthbind, 4th: creation</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Torag makes his pleasure or displeasure known through unsubtle signs.<br><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Torag repairs your equipment so you may continue your vigil.

Torag can grant this boon just as the item would have been destroyed, preventing the item’s destruction. Occasionally, he grants this boon to restore an item important to dwarven history that has already been fully destroyed.<br><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You are counted as family among Torag and his followers.
