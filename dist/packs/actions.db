Casting a Spell is a special activity that takes a variable number of actions depending on the spell, as listed in each spell&rsquo;s stat block. As soon as the spellcasting actions are complete, the spell effect occurs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some spells are cast as a reaction or free action. In those cases, you Cast the Spell as a reaction or free action (as appropriate) instead of as an activity. Such cases will be noted in the spell&rsquo;s stat block&mdash;for example, &ldquo;[reaction] verbal.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Long Casting Times Some spells take minutes or hours to cast. The Cast a Spell activity for these spells includes a mix of the listed spell components, but it&rsquo;s not necessary to break down which one you&rsquo;re providing at a given time. You can&rsquo;t use other actions or reactions while casting such a spell, though at the GM&rsquo;s discretion, you might be able to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take a long time, these spells have the exploration trait, and you can&rsquo;t cast them in an encounter. If combat breaks out while you&rsquo;re casting one, your spell is disrupted (see Disrupted and Lost Spells on page 303).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spell Components Each spell lists the spell components required to cast it after the action icons or text, such as &ldquo;[three-actions] material, somatic, verbal.\" The spell components, described in detail below, add traits and requirements to the Cast a Spell activity. If you can&rsquo;t provide the components, you fail to Cast the Spell.</p>\n<p>Material (manipulate)</p>\n<p>Somatic (manipulate)</p>\n<p>Verbal (concentrate)</p>\n<p>Focus (manipulate)</p>\n<p>Disrupted and Lost Spells Some abilities and spells can disrupt a spell, causing it to have no effect and be lost. When you lose a spell, you&rsquo;ve already expended the spell slot, spent the spell&rsquo;s costs and actions, and used the Cast a Spell activity. If a spell is disrupted during a Sustain a Spell action, the spell immediately ends. The full rules for disrupting actions appear on page 462.</p>"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"},"actionType":{"type":"String","label":"Action Type","value":"passive"},"weapon":{"type":"String","label":"Associated Weapon","value":""},"actions":{"type":"String","label":"Number of Actions","value":""},"requirements":{"type":"String","label":"Requirements"},"trigger":{"type":"String","label":"Trigger"},"traits":{"type":"String","label":"Traits","value":["general"],"custom":""},"skill_requirement":{"type":"String","label":"Skill Req.","skill":{"type":"Number","skill":"","rank":""}}},"sort":2200001,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","_id":"aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz"}

You can&rsquo;t perform other downtime activities while retraining.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Retraining usually requires you to spend time learning from a teacher, whether that entails physical training, studying at a library, or falling into shared magical trances. Your GM determines whether you can get proper training or whether something can be retrained at all. In some cases, you&rsquo;ll have to pay your instructor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some abilities can be difficult or impossible to retrain (for instance, a sorcerer can retrain their bloodline only in extraordinary circumstances).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When retraining, you generally can&rsquo;t make choices you couldn&rsquo;t make when you selected the original option. For instance, you can&rsquo;t exchange a 2nd-level skill feat for a 4th-level one, or for one that requires prerequisites you didn&rsquo;t meet at the time you took the original feat. If you don&rsquo;t remember whether you met the prerequisites at the time, ask your GM to make the call. If you cease to meet the prerequisites for an ability due to retraining, you can&rsquo;t use that ability. You might need to retrain several abilities in sequence in order to get all the abilities you want.</p>\n<p>Feats</p>\n<p>You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your feats. Remove the old feat and replace it with another of the same type. For example, you could swap a skill feat for another skill feat, but not for a wizard feat.</p>\n<p>Skills</p>\n<p>You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your skill increases. Reduce your proficiency rank in the skill losing its increase by one step and increase your proficiency rank in another skill by one step. The new proficiency rank has to be equal to or lower than the proficiency rank you traded away. For instance, if your bard is a master in Performance and Stealth, and an expert in Occultism, you could reduce the character&rsquo;s proficiency in Stealth to expert and become a master in Occultism, but you couldn&rsquo;t reassign that skill increase to become legendary in Performance. Keep track of your level when you reassign skill increases; the level at which your skill proficiencies changed can influence your ability to retrain feats with skill prerequisites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can also spend a week to retrain an initial trained skill you gained during character creation.</p>\n<p>Class Features</p>\n<p>You can change a class feature that required a choice, making a different choice instead.
