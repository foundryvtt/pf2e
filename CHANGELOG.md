## 5.8.3

### Notice

The 5.8 series of system releases is the final one before changes from Pathfinder Player Core and Pathfinder GM Core are added. The majority of changes are simple renaming of some items, traits, and other elements, with some small tweaks to mechanics. Some of the coming non-renaming changes are more substantial:

PC options: current Witch patron themes, Wizard arcane schools, and the Tiefling & Aasimar heritages are being moved to a "PF2e Legacy Data" module, which will be available soon.

Alignment: alignment is being removed from all sheets, but the data will still exist on actors, hidden until a module enables the display of them as traits.

Variant rules: the Dual Class and Ancestry Paragon variant rules are moving to the PF2e Workbench module. Other variants that were not reprinted, like Stamina, will be staying in the system as they are difficult to reproduce in module form.

Premium modules: many adventure modules, such as those developed by Foundry Gaming and Sigil Services, keep up with system releases. This means updating the pf2e system version will be required to run such modules in the future.

We will update our system wiki with a full list of changes prior to the 5.9 system release.
