Please Note:
- Functionality is not complete with plenty of work remaining. 
- This is a fork of the dnd5e system so there may still be references to dnd5e in places and the assets from 5e are included for now (I plan to use them soon).
- If you find any issues or have any feedback please let me know.

Known Issues (see project issues for full issues list):
- AC is not automatically calculated, Just enter it in the input field.
- Critical damage is not calculated currently.
