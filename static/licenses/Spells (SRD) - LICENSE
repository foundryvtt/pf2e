Unity Asset Store End User License Agreement:
1. Parties to the Agreement/The Subject Matter of the Agreement
1.1
This Unity Asset Store End User License Agreement (“EULA”) is a non-exclusive, legally binding end user license agreement between any individual or a single entity (“END-USER”) that acquires a license to an Asset from the Unity Asset Store and either (a) Unity Technologies ApS (company no. 30 71 99 13), Lovstraede 5, DK-1152 Copenhagen K, Denmark (“Licensor” or "Unity"); or, as the case may be (b) any third party (“Provider”) that distributes its Assets from the Unity Asset Store. Consequently, this EULA shall apply regardless of whether a purchased Asset is produced by Unity or by a Provider ("Licensor"). This EULA is therefore a non-exclusive, legally binding end user license agreement as the case may be between either (i) Unity and END-USER (in which case the term "Licensor" shall refer to Unity), or (ii) Provider and END-USER (in which case the term "Licensor" shall refer to Provider).

1.2
By installing, copying, accessing, downloading or otherwise using the Assets, END-USER agrees to be bound the provisions of this EULA. All definitions of the Terms shall also apply in this EULA unless the context clearly provides for a different understanding.

1.3
The subject matter of this EULA is the licensing to END-USER of any Assets from Licensor via the Unity Asset Store. The Assets are licensed, not sold.

1.4
END USER hereby acknowledges that in the event it acquires a license to an ASSET which in the Unity Asset Store is marked as an Asset which is distributed by Provider (as opposed to Unity), then Provider shall be considered as Licensor of such Asset and, consequently, only Provider (as opposed to Unity) shall be responsible for any liability whatsoever under, any EULA or any breach by Provider, including (without limitation) liability for infringement of any intellectual property rights, irrespective of the fact that payment takes place to Unity.

2. END-USER's Rights and Obligations
2.1
END-USER may use the licensed Assets only for their intended purpose.

2.2
2.2.1 Non-Restricted Assets. The following concerns only Assets that are not Restricted Assets: Licensor grants to the END-USER a non-exclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to the Asset to integrate it only as incorporated and embedded components of electronic games and digital media and distribute such electronic game and digital media; reproduction and display in distributed physical advertising materials is permitted solely for marketing purposes in respect of such electronic games or digital media. Except for game services software development kits (“Services SDKs”), END-USERS may modify Assets. END-USER may otherwise not reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, distribute, sublicense, rent, lease or lend the Assets. It is emphasized that the END-USERS shall not be entitled to distribute or transfer in any way (including, without, limitation by way of sublicense) the Assets in any other way than as integrated components of electronic games and digital media or in supporting physical marketing materials. Without limitation of the foregoing it is emphasized that END-USER shall not be entitled to share the costs related to purchasing an Asset and then let any third party that has contributed to such purchase use such Asset (forum pooling).

2.2.2 Restricted Assets. The following concerns only Restricted Assets: Restricted Assets have license terms different from other Assets. Those license terms are found in the materials accompanying Restricted Assets ("Restricted Asset Terms"). For clarity, to the extent Restricted Asset Terms are different from this EULA, the Restricted Asset Terms will control; otherwise, this EULA will continue to apply. No other use is licensed or permitted and END-USER may otherwise not use, reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, distribute, sublicense, rent, lease or lend Restricted Assets. Without limitation of the foregoing it is emphasized that END-USER shall not be entitled to share the costs related to purchasing a Restricted Asset and then let any third party that has contributed to such purchase use such Restricted Asset (forum pooling).

2.3
2.3.1 EXCEPT FOR EDITOR EXTENSION OR APPLICATION ASSETS, END-USER is granted a license to install and use Assets on an unlimited number of computers provided that these computers are either all (a) physically located at a single physical location ("Site") belonging to END-USER, or (b) laptops belonging to END-USER which have been made available by END-USER to its employees that are employed at the same Site provided all such computers have appropriately licensed Unity software installed. Consequently, any Asset may only be used at particular Site or on computers assigned to END-USER's employees employed at the same Site and may only be moved to another Site subject to prior written approval from Licensor. THIS SECTION 2.3.1 DOES NOT APPLY TO ASSETS THAT IN THE UNITY ASSET STORE ARE CATEGORIZED UNDER THE HEADING "EDITOR EXTENSIONS" OR “APPLICATIONS”.

2.3.2 Editor Extensions; Applications: END-USER is granted a single seat license to install and use any Asset categorized in the Asset Store as "Editor Extensions" or “Application” only on a maximum of 2 computers. For the avoidance of doubt, Editor Extension and Application Assets are licensed on a per seat basis may not be shared or used concurrently on more than 2 different computers. As an exception, build farm servers and virtual machine instances used only for running, testing, or building projects with Editor Extension or Application Assets do not require separate seat license(s) or constitute use on more than 2 different computers.  

2.4
An END-USER may use an Asset under SECTIONS 2.2 and 2.3, and may have a third party, including any “work-for-hire” contractor or “freelancer” (“Contractor”), work on that Asset on its behalf. However, any Contractor working on a project for an END-USER must have license(s) of its own to the Asset. Conversely, to use an Asset under SECTIONS 2.2 and 2.3, a person must have its own license to the Asset, regardless of whether a Contractor working on a project for that person had its own license to that Asset. For example, a person who is a Contractor must have a seat license for an Editor Extension Asset, and the persons who is hirer of the Contractor must have a seat license for that Editor Extension Asset.   

2.5
Game Services SDKs: If END-USER downloads and integrates Services SDKs, END-USER may be required to accept a Licensor end user agreement and/or additional Licensor terms and conditions to use such services.

2.6
END-USER shall pay for the license to the Assets in accordance with the payment process provided in the Asset Store. END USER shall provide customary billing and tax information such as name, billing address, credit card information and VAT number (for EU residents). END USER agrees to pay for all purchases hereby authorizes the collection of such amounts including applicable taxes by charging the credit card provided, either directly by Unity or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor. VAT numbers cannot be added or changed after the purchase is completed. If you are directed to a third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party's service and that third party's Privacy Policy. Please review such third party's terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services.

2.7
Some components of Assets (whether developed by Unity or third parties) may also be governed by applicable open source software licenses. In the event of a conflict between the applicable EULA and any such open source licenses, the open source software licenses shall prevail with respect to those components.

2.8
You agree that no modification or use of those Assets shall (a) infringe, misappropriate, or violate a third party's patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights, or other intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy; (b) violate, or encourage any conduct that would violate, any applicable law or regulation or would give rise to liability of any kind; (c) be fraudulent, false, misleading, or deceptive; (d) be defamatory, obscene, pornographic, vulgar, or offensive; (e) promote discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment, or harm against any individual or group; (f) promote violence or actions that are threatening to any other person; or (g) promote illegal or harmful activities or substances.

2.9
2.9.1 All sales are final and there shall be no refunds except as expressly provided in this EULA or as required by law.

2.9.2 On acceptance of END-USER orders for licenses to Assets, content will be immediately available for download. END-USERS expressly consent to the making available of that content immediately upon acceptance of orders. If END-USER is a resident of the European Union and purchases any license to any Asset, the right to withdraw from such purchase within 14 days of the date of purchase ("Cooling Off Period") may be available; however, this right of withdrawal will not apply where performance begins before the end of the Cooling Off Period. Therefore, END-USERS expressly agree and understand that if END-USER orders any license to any Asset, END-USER's right of withdrawal is forfeited upon acceptance as performance begins immediately on acceptance.

2.9.3 You may request a refund from a Provider in the following circumstances:

            (a) within 2 weeks of purchase of a license to an Asset where,

(i) the Asset was not as advertised (including any demo made available);

(ii) the Asset is not compatible with the most recent official release of Unity and no information was provided at the Unity Asset Store to indicate that Asset is so incompatible; or

(iii) the Asset includes unauthorized intellectual property.

            (b) the Asset is removed from the Unity Asset Store within 4 weeks of purchase of a license to an Asset and,

                        (i) the Provider caused the removal; or

                        (ii) Unity removed the Asset because it is or is alleged to be defective, malicious, infringes intellectual property rights of another person, defames, violates a third party's right of publicity or privacy, or does not comply with applicable law.

2.10
In this EULA, “Restricted Asset” means any Asset licensed hereunder that is designated (on prior written approval from Unity) as a “Restricted Asset” in any materials accompanying the Asset.

3. Licensor's Rights and Obligations

4.3
In the event that Unity at its discretion or as a result of a decision made by any competent court or authority makes a refund to END-USER of the fees paid for any Asset, then this EULA shall terminate for such Asset.

4.4
In the event of termination of this EULA, all license rights granted herein terminate and END-USER shall immediately destroy any and all copies of the Assets contained on any type of media under the control of END-USER and confirm such destruction in writing to LICENSOR.

5. Duplication Rights/Back Up Copy
5.1
END-USER may not make copies of the Assets, except incidental transient or temporary copies or otherwise to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted under mandatory statutory applicable law.

7. Trademarks
This EULA does not grant END-USER any rights in connection with any trademarks or service marks of Licensor, Provider or Licensor's other suppliers.

8. Upgrades and Support
8.1
Assets identified as upgrades replace and/or supplement the licensed Assets.

8.2
Licensor may at its own discretion from time to time provide upgrades of the Assets to END USER without requesting further payment. Irrespective hereof END-USER is only entitled to licenses to upgrades if END-USER has entered into an Upgrade Agreement with Licensor. END-USER may use the upgraded Assets only in accordance with the terms of this EULA.

8.3
END-USER is only entitled to support if END-USER has entered into a Support Agreement with Licensor.

All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Licensor. For greater certainty and without limitation of the foregoing, use of Assets, whether modified as permitted hereunder or unmodified, is limited to use as expressly provided in this EULA.

10. Disclaimer of Warranties
10.1
END-USER UNDERSTANDS AND ACCEPTS THAT PRIOR TO PLACING ANY ASSET ON THE UNITY ASSET STORE, UNITY DOES NOT UNDERTAKE ANY LEGAL OBLIGATION TO MONITOR, PRE-SCREEN, REVIEW, FLAG, FILTER, MODIFY, REFUSE OR REMOVE ANY ASSET OR THEIR CONTENT FROM THE UNITY ASSET STORE.
