This allows you efficient access to various metamagic effects. You gain a 1st-level metamagic wizard feat as a bonus feat. Starting at 4th level, during your daily preparations, you can gain a metamagic wizard feat of your choice that has a level requirement of no more than half your level, which you can use until your next daily preparations.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.OAcxS625AXSGrQIC]{Spell Blending}</h2>\n<p>You theorize that spell slots are a shorthand for an underlying energy that powers all spellcasting, and you’ve found a way to tinker with the hierarchy of spell slots, combining them to fuel more powerful spells. When you make your daily preparations, you can trade two spell slots of the same level for a bonus spell slot of up to 2 levels higher than the traded spell slots. You can exchange as many spell slots as you have available. Bonus spell slots must be of a level you can normally cast, and each bonus spell slot must be of a different spell level. You can also trade any spell slot for two additional cantrips, though you cannot trade more than one spell slot at a time for additional cantrips in this way.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.QzWXMCSGNfvvpYgF]{Spell Substitution}</h2>\n<p>You don’t accept the fact that once spells are prepared, they can’t be changed until your next daily preparation, and you have uncovered a shortcut allowing you to substitute new spells for those you originally prepared.

The more revelation spells you cast, the worse the effects of your curse, but these increasingly conflicting energies can also provide you with divine benefits.</p>\n<p>The specific effects of your curse are tied to your mystery, but all curses follow the same progression. A curse continually gives you a mild but constant reminder that you carry otherworldly power. As you cast revelation spells, your curse intensifies, first to a minor effect and then to a moderate effect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your curse progresses to its minor stage the first time you finish casting a revelation spell after your daily preparations. Once your minor curse has manifested, it remains in effect until you rest for 8 hours and again make your daily preparations. If you cast a revelation spell while your minor curse is in effect, you progress to the moderate curse effect immediately after you finish Casting the Spell. The minor effect continues to affect you, though some moderate curse effects might alter the specifics of your minor curse. At higher levels, you can cast more revelation spells, progressing your curse to its major stage and then an extreme stage; these stronger curses are cumulative with the effects of the lower stages and can alter them. When you Refocus while under the effects of your moderate or stronger curse, you reduce your curse’s severity to minor in addition to regaining a Focus Point.</p>\n<p>Drawing upon your mystery’s power while your curse is at its worst causes an irreconcilable conflict between you and the sources of your power. Immediately after casting a revelation spell while under the moderate effect of your curse, you are overwhelmed. While overwhelmed, you can’t Cast or Sustain any revelation spells—you effectively lose access to those spells. You can still Refocus to reduce the effects of your curse and regain a Focus Point, but doing so doesn’t allow you to cast further revelation spells.

For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["bard"],"custom":""},"rarity":{"value":"common"},"usage":{"value":"held-in-one-hand"},"level":{"value":"3"},"featType":{"value":"classfeature"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actionCategory":{"value":""},"actions":{"value":""},"prerequisites":{"value":""}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/signature-spells-bard.jpg"}
