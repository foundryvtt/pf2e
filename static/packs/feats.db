Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity risks exposing you as a vigilante. This means that if you were particularly meek or inconspicuous before you took this feat, your identity could be at greater risk of exposure. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can otherwise use both social and vigilante abilities in either identity unless they rely on your identity being a secret.
