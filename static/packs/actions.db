You can’t perform other downtime activities while retraining.</span></p>\n<p><span>Retraining usually requires you to spend time learning from a teacher, whether that entails physical training, studying at a library, or falling into shared magical trances. Your GM determines whether you can get proper training or whether something can be retrained at all.

If you don’t remember whether you met the prerequisites at the time, ask your GM to make the call. If you cease to meet the prerequisites for an ability due to retraining, you can’t use that ability.

Reduce your proficiency rank in the skill losing its increase by one step and increase your proficiency rank in another skill by one step. The new proficiency rank has to be equal to or lower than the proficiency rank you traded away. For instance, if your bard is a master in Performance and Stealth, and an expert in Occultism, you could reduce the character’s proficiency in Stealth to expert and become a master in Occultism, but you couldn’t reassign that skill increase to become legendary in Performance.

It’s usually easy to find work making basic items whose level is 1 or 2 below your settlement’s level (see Earn Income on page 504). Higher-level tasks represent special commissions, which might require you to Craft a specific item using the Craft downtime activity and sell it to a buyer at full price. These opportunities don’t occur as often and might have special requirements—or serious consequences if you disappoint a prominent client.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Practicing a Trade [Lore]</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Core Rulebook pg. 237</em><br>You apply the practical benefits of one of your Lore specialties during downtime by practicing your trade. This is most effective for Lore specialties such as business, law, or sailing, where there’s high demand for workers. The GM might increase the DC or determine only low-level tasks are available if you’re attempting to use an obscure Lore skill to Earn Income. You might also need specialized tools to accept a job, like mining tools to work in a mine or a merchant’s scale to buy and sell valuables in a market.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Staging a Performance [Performance]</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Core Rulebook pg. 238</em><br>You perform for an audience to make money. The available audiences determine the level of your task, since more discerning audiences are harder to impress but provide a bigger payout. The GM determines the task level based on the audiences available. Performing for a typical audience of commoners on the street is a level 0 task, but a performance for a group of artisans with more refined tastes might be a 2nd- or 3rd-level task, and ones for merchants, nobility, and royalty are increasingly higher level. Your degree of success determines whether you moved your audience and whether you were rewarded with applause or rotten fruit.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","type":"String","label":"Description"},"source":{"value":"","type":"String","label":"Source"},"traits":{"value":["skill","downtime"],"type":"String","label":"Traits","custom":""},"rarity":{"value":"common"},"usage":{"value":"held-in-one-hand"},"actionType":{"value":"passive","type":"String","label":"Action Type"},"actionCategory":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":"","type":"String","label":"Associated Weapon"},"actions":{"value":"","type":"String","label":"Number of Actions"},"requirements":{"value":"","type":"String","label":"Requirements"},"trigger":{"value":"","type":"String","label":"Trigger"},"skill_requirements":{"skill":"","rank":""},"skill_requirement":{"type":"String","label":"Skill Req.","skill":{"type":"Number","skill":"","rank":"1"}}},"sort":200001,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
