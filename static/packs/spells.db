While some versions of this ritual offer all of the forms, others include only a single form or only a few of them. Whichever form you use, the effect can’t be counteracted, though it can be ended by @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.4ddJSjC9Zz5DX0oG]{Freedom}. Some forms of <em>imprisonment</em> can be ended by other means. Because the ritual requires the target to remain within 10 feet at all times, it typically requires you to subdue the target first.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chains</strong> You bind the creature with chains, rendering it unable to use any actions other than to speak. Other creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains, or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The chains have Hardness equal to 5 × the <em>imprisonment</em> ritual’s spell level, and double that many Hit Points. Destroying the chains frees the target.</li>\n<li><strong>Object (9th level or higher)</strong> You either shrink the creature to an inch in height or transform it into an insubstantial form whose body trails away into wisps below its head. Either way, you trap it inside a gem, jar, bottle, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn’t require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its surroundings and can move within the container and speak, but it can’t use any other&nbsp;actions. Destroying the container kills the target rather than freeing it. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also transmutation magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Oubliette (10th level only)</strong> You entomb the target in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so that it can’t be reached by any means. You also prevent divinations from revealing the location where the <em>imprisonment</em> occurred. Powerful magic such as @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish} can reveal the location of the imprisonment, but even such magic can’t free the target from the oubliette; only a 10th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.4ddJSjC9Zz5DX0oG]{Freedom} ritual can do so.</li>\n<li><strong>Prison</strong> You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature’s prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.</li>\n<li><strong>Slumber (sleep effect)</strong> You put the creature into an eternal sleep. It ceases aging and doesn’t require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target—whether romantically, filially, or otherwise—frees it from the slumber. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also enchantment magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Temporal Stasis</strong> You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn’t grow older and can’t be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends. Unlike other forms of <em>imprisonment</em>, temporal stasis can be counteracted by a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.9HpwDN4MYQJnW0LG]{Dispel Magic} or @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.o6YCGx4lycsYpww4]{Haste} spell. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also transmutation magic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You imprison the target.

You can also leave out this step, removing the need for a Crafting check, with the same result (if you’re summoning a good outsider you trust, for example).

These astral&nbsp;forms can be used to explore the Astral Plane indefinitely, while&nbsp;the targets’ bodies remain safely in stasis on the plane where&nbsp;the ritual was cast (where they remain unconscious and can’t&nbsp;be awoken normally). The casters must be in physical contact&nbsp;with one another in a circle for the duration of the casting, and&nbsp;all targets must be selected from these casters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A target’s astral form is a duplicate of the target and everything they’re carrying; anything that happens to a duplicate item happens to the original as well. For instance, if you use, spend, destroy, lose, or give away an item’s duplicate, the original vanishes from your possession. For the duration of the ritual, any of the targets can spend a single action to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.AjLSHZSWQ90exdLo]{Dismiss} their astral form and immediately return to their physical body. As the primary caster, when you Dismiss your astral form, you can also Dismiss all the other targets’ astral forms as part of the same action, returning all targets to their physical forms simultaneously. While in the Astral Plane, the other targets are unable to navigate without you, and if they become separated from you, they must wait for your return or Dismiss their own astral forms. When the ritual ends, the targets’ astral forms vanish.</p>\n<p>A target’s astral form and corresponding physical form are linked by an incorporeal silver cord, which is visible only in the Astral Plane. This nearly unbreakable cord serves as a conduit and safety line; if it is severed, the target’s astral and physical forms are both immediately slain. If the ritual is interrupted by an external force, such as @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.9HpwDN4MYQJnW0LG]{Dispel Magic} being cast on a target’s physical or astral form, the target is immediately and harmlessly returned to their physical body. If a target’s astral form is slain, the silver cord immediately rips them back to their physical body; the strain requires them to attempt a Fortitude save with the same DC as the ritual’s primary check. On a failure, the creature dies; on a success, they become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy} 2, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained} 2, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed} 2, and @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled} 2 for 1 week; these conditions can’t be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed.

If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster—for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage—the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

It continues to do so until you move the guardian to attack an enemy or defend a different ally, or until the guardian is destroyed (it has 50 Hit Points and can't recover Hit Points by any means). The guardian can't usually take damage except when protecting an ally, though <em>disintegrate</em> automatically destroys it if it hits the spiritual guardian's AC of 25.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The guardian's Strikes are melee spell attacks. Regardless of the appearance of the guardian's weapon, the guardian deals force damage equal to 2d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, but you can deal damage of the type normally dealt by the weapon it holds instead of force damage. No other traits or statistics of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. Despite making a spell attack, the spiritual guardian's weapon is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The guardian takes up space and allies can use it when flanking, but it doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have aside from Hit Points, and creatures can move through its space without hindrance. The guardian can't make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons or enhance allies do not apply to the guardian.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The guardian's damage increases by 1d8, and its Hit Points increase by 20.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","type":"String","label":"Description"},"source":{"value":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=305","type":"String","label":"Source"},"traits":{"value":["abjuration","attack","force"],"type":"String","label":"Spell Traits","rarity":{"value":"common"}},"rarity":{"value":"common"},"usage":{"value":"held-in-one-hand"},"level":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Spell Level"},"spellType":{"value":"attack","type":"String","label":"Spell Type"},"spellCategory":{"value":""},"traditions":{"value":["divine"],"type":"String","label":"Spell Traditions"},"school":{"value":"abj","type":"String","label":"Spell School"},"components":{"value":"somatic, verbal","type":"String","label":"Spell Components"},"materials":{"value":"You have a deity.","type":"String","label":"Materials"},"target":{"value":"","type":"String","label":"Target"},"range":{"value":"120 feet","type":"String","label":"Range"},"area":{"value":null,"type":"String","label":"Area","areaType":""},"time":{"value":"2","type":"String","label":"Casting Time"},"duration":{"value":"sustained up to 1 minute","type":"String","label":"Duration"},"damage":{"value":"2d8","applyMod":true,"type":"String","label":"Spell Damage"},"damageType":{"value":"force","type":"String","label":"Damage Type"},"scaling":{"mode":"level1","formula":"1d8"},"save":{"basic":"","type":"String","label":"Saving Throw","value":""},"sustained":{"value":false,"type":"Boolean","label":"Can be Sustained"},"cost":{"value":"","type":"String","label":"Cost"},"ability":{"value":"","type":"String","label":"Spellcasting Ability"},"prepared":{"value":"","type":"String","label":"Prepared Spell"},"location":{"value":"","type":"String","label":"Spellcasting Entry Location"},"spellCategorie":{"value":"spell"},"primarycheck":{"value":""},"secondarycheck":{"value":""},"areasize":{"value":""},"secondarycasters":{"value":""}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/spiritual-guardian.jpg"}
