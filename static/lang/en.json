An attached weapon is usually bolted onto or built into the item it's attached to, and typically an item can have only one weapon attached to it.

You can select a class archetype only if your class meets the criteria listed in the archetype's prerequisites. Class archetypes always alter or replace some of a class's static class features in addition to any new feats they offer. It might be possible to take a class archetype at 1st level if it alters or replaces some of the class's initial class features. The 1st-level ability is presented much like a class feature and includes the class archetype's prerequisites and rules on how it changes your class.

If you choose to use one of them, they replace the melee usage's normal critical specialization effect. First, you can discharge the firearm to create a loud bang and concussion, using the critical specialization effect for firearms instead of the melee weapon group's critical specialization effect. Second, you can choose to discharge the firearm to increase the critical hit's momentum or shoot the foe as you attack them in melee, dealing 2 additional damage per weapon damage die.

This increases to two dice if the weapon has a greater striking rune and three dice if the weapon has a major striking rune.

An ability that changes the size of the weapon's normal damage dice doesn't change the size of its deadly die.",

This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.",

        "TraitDescriptionFatalAim": "It's possible to hold the stock of this weapon under one arm so you can fire it with a single hand, but if you use both hands, the weapon can make fatal attacks. When you wield the weapon in two hands, it gains the fatal trait with the listed damage die. Holding the weapon underarm stably enough to fire is significantly more complicated than just releasing one hand from the weapon, so switching between the two grips requires its own Interact action, not via Releasing or as part of reloading.",
        "TraitDescriptionFatal": "The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weapon's damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.",

You can use the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on.

        "TraitDescriptionGrapple": "You can use this weapon to Grapple with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",
        "TraitDescriptionGrippli": "Gripplis are a family of frog-like humanoids",
        "TraitDescriptionGunslinger": "This indicates abilities from the gunslinger class.",

        "TraitDescriptionHampering": "A weapon with the hampering trait includes a disruptive limb or flange. You can use an Interact action to thrash the weapon in a square within the weapon's reach. That square becomes difficult terrain until you attack with the weapon, move, would otherwise stop thrashing it, or at the beginning of your next turn.",
        "TraitDescriptionHaunt": "A hazard with this trait is a spiritual echo, often of someone with a tragic death. Putting a haunt to rest often involves resolving the haunt's unfinished business. A haunt that hasn't been properly put to rest always returns after a time.",

        "TraitDescriptionIfrit": "A type of geniekin descended from a being from the Plane of Fire.",
        "TraitDescriptionIncapacitation": "An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it's harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell's level treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.",
        "TraitDescriptionIncorporeal": "An incorporeal creature or object has no physical form. It can pass through solid objects, including walls. When inside an object, an incorporeal creature can't perceive, attack, or interact with anything outside the object, and if it starts its turn in an object, it is slowed 1. Corporeal creatures can pass through an incorporeal creature, but they can't end their movement in its space. An incorporeal creature can't attempt Strength-based checks against physical creatures or objects-only against incorporeal ones-unless those objects have the ghost touch property rune. Likewise, a corporeal creature can't attempt Strength-based checks against incorporeal creatures or objects. Incorporeal creatures usually have immunity to effects or conditions that require a physical body, like disease, poison, and precision damage. They usually have resistance against all damage (except force damage and damage from Strikes with the ghost touch property rune), with double the resistance against non-magical damage.",
        "TraitDescriptionInfused": "You created an alchemical item with the infused trait using your infused reagents, and it has a limited time before it becomes inert. Any nonpermanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again.",

        "TraitDescriptionInhaled": "This poison is delivered when breathed in.",
        "TraitDescriptionInjection": "This weapon can be filled with an injury poison.

        "TraitDescriptionIntelligent": "An item with this trait is intelligent and has its own will and personality, as well as several statistics that most items don't have. Intelligent items can't be crafted by normal means, and they are always rare or unique.",

        "TraitDescriptionInvestigator": "This indicates abilities from the investigator class.",
        "TraitDescriptionJoustingD6": "The weapon is suited for mounted combat with a harness or similar means. When mounted, if you moved at least 10 feet on the action before your attack, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that attack equal to the number of damage dice for the weapon. In addition, while mounted, you can wield the weapon in one hand, changing the damage die to the listed value.",
        "TraitDescriptionKobold": "A creature with this trait is a member of the kobold ancestry.",
        "TraitDescriptionKickback": "A kickback weapon is extra powerful and difficult to use due to its high recoil. A kickback weapon deals 1 additional damage with all attacks. Firing a kickback weapon gives a –2 circumstance penalty to the attack roll, but characters with 14 or more Strength ignore the penalty. Attaching a kickback weapon to a deployed bipod, tripod, or other stabilizer can lower or negate this penalty.",
        "TraitDescriptionKitsune": "Shapeshifting humanoids whose true forms resemble foxes.",
        "TraitDescriptionLawful": "Lawful effects often manipulate energy from law-aligned Outer Planes and are antithetical to chaotic divine servants or divine servants of chaotic deities.

        "TraitDescriptionLeshy": "A creature with this trait is a member of the leshy ancestry.",
        "TraitDescriptionLight": "Light effects overcome non-magical darkness in the area, and can counteract magical darkness. You must usually target darkness magic with your light magic directly to counteract the darkness, but some light spells automatically attempt to counteract darkness.",
        "TraitDescriptionLinguistic": "An effect with this trait depends on language comprehension. A linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using.",

        "TraitDescriptionMagical": "Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic. Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.",
        "TraitDescriptionManipulate": "You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can't perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.",
        "TraitDescriptionMechanical": "A hazard with this trait is a constructed physical object.",
        "TraitDescriptionMental": "A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.",
        "TraitDescriptionMetamagic": "Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action itself.",
        "TraitDescriptionMinion": "Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature. A creature with this trait can use only 2 actions per turn and can't use reactions. Your minion acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue it commands. For an animal companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that's a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain a Spell or Sustain an Activation; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command, a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for long enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don't act, animals follow their instincts, and sapient minions act how they please.",
        "TraitDescriptionMisfortune": "A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.",
        "TraitDescriptionModification": "A feat with this trait alters the construction of your innovation. If you have the reconfigure class feature, you can retrain such a feat more easily.",
        "TraitDescriptionModular": "The weapon has multiple configurations that you can switch between using an Interact action. Typically, switching between configurations of a modular weapon allows it to deal different types of damage (listed in the trait, such as “modular B, P, or S”), though it's possible for a modular weapon's description to list more complicated configurations.",
        "TraitDescriptionMonk": "Abilities with this trait are from the monk class. A weapon with this trait is primarily used by monks.",
        "TraitDescriptionMonkWeapon": "Many monks learn to use these weapons.",
        "TraitDescriptionMorph": "Effects that slightly alter a creature's form have the morph trait. Any Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical. You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more than once, the second morph effect attempts to counteract the first (in the same manner as two polymorph effects, described in that trait). Your morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect. The GM determines which morph effects can be used together and which can't.",
        "TraitDescriptionMounted": "Mounted siege weapons take up a certain size and space, and typically have statistics to allow them to be attacked. They're used for large-scale warfare.",
        "TraitDescriptionMove": "An action with this trait involves moving from one space to another.",
        "TraitDescriptionMulticlass": "Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying your training into another class's specialties. You can't select a multiclass archetype's dedication feat if you are a member of the class of the same name.",

        "TraitDescriptionNone": "This trait has no description.",
        "TraitDescriptionNonlethal": "Attacks with this weapon are nonlethal, and are used to knock creatures unconscious instead of kill them. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a -2 circumstance penalty.",
        "TraitDescriptionOath": "Oaths add an additional tenet to your code. You can usually have only one feat with this trait.",
        "TraitDescriptionOccult": "This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.",
        "TraitDescriptionOlfactory": "An olfactory effect can affect only creatures that can smell it. This applies only to olfactory parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.",
        "TraitDescriptionOpen": "These maneuvers work only as the first salvo on your turn. You can use an open only if you haven't used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.",

        "TraitDescriptionOread": "A type of geniekin descended from a being from the Plane of Earth.",
        "TraitDescriptionOrc": "A creature with this trait is a member of the orc ancestry. A weapon with this trait is a weapon which orcs craft and use.",
        "TraitDescriptionParry": "This weapon can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your proficiency with it is trained or better, you can spend an Interact action to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.",
        "TraitDescriptionPoison": "An effect with this trait delivers a poison or deals poison damage. An item with this trait is poisonous and might cause an affliction.",
        "TraitDescriptionPolymorph": "These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can't be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry. If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",
        "TraitDescriptionPortable": "Portable siege weapons, such as battering rams, can be more easily carried and have a role in both warfare and smaller conflicts or exploration.",
        "TraitDescriptionPoppet": "A creature with this trait is a member of the poppet ancestry.",
        "TraitDescriptionPositive": "Effects with this trait heal living creatures with positive energy, deal positive energy damage to undead, or manipulate positive energy.",
        "TraitDescriptionPossession": "Effects with this trait allow a creature to project its mind and spirit into a target. A creature immune to mental effects can't use a possession effect. While possessing a target, a possessor's true body is unconscious (and can't wake up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental damage. A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target's active spells and abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target's abilities that are purely physical, and it can't use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target's attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, spell attack roll, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the possessor's invested items apply when using its own values, and the target's invested items apply when using the target's values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn't in its own body. The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act. If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If the target dies, the possession ends immediately and the possessor is stunned for 1 minute.",
        "TraitDescriptionPrecious": "Valuable materials with special properties have the precious trait. They can be substituted for base materials when you Craft items.",
        "TraitDescriptionPrediction": "Effects with this trait determine what is likely to happen in the near future. Most predictions are divinations.",
        "TraitDescriptionPress": "Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. You can't use a press action when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)",
        "TraitDescriptionPrimal": "This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.",
        "TraitDescriptionPropulsive": "You add half your Strength modifier (if positive) to damage rolls with a propulsive ranged weapon. If you have a negative Strength modifier, you add your full Strength modifier instead.",
        "TraitDescriptionRage": "You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.",
        "TraitDescriptionRange": "These attacks will either list a finite range or a range increment, which follows the normal rules for range increments.",
        "TraitDescriptionRangedTrip": "This weapon can be used to Trip with the Athletics skill at a distance up to the weapon's first range increment. The skill check takes a -2 circumstance penalty. You can add the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the check. As with using a melee weapon to trip, a ranged trip doesn't deal any damage when used to Trip.",
        "TraitDescriptionRanger": "This indicates abilities from the ranger class.",
        "TraitDescriptionRare": "This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.",
        "TraitDescriptionRatfolk": "A creature with this trait is a member of the ratfolk ancestry.",
        "TraitDescriptionReach": "Natural attacks with this trait can be used to attack creatures up to the listed distance away instead of only adjacent creatures. Weapons with this trait are long and can be used to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.",
        "TraitDescriptionReckless": "Actions with the reckless trait run the risk of the pilot losing control of a vehicle. When performing a reckless action, the pilot must first attempt an appropriate piloting check to keep control of the vehicle.",
        "TraitDescriptionReload": "While all weapons need some amount of time to get into position, many ranged weapons also need to be loaded and reloaded. This entry indicates how many Interact actions it takes to reload such weapons. This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and firing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, the GM determines whether they must be performed together as an activity, or you can spend some of those actions during one turn and the rest during your next turn.",
        "TraitDescriptionRepeating": "A repeating weapon is typically a type of crossbow that has a shorter reload time. These weapons can't be loaded with individual bolts like other crossbows; instead, they require a magazine of specialized ammunition to be loaded into a special slot. Once that magazine is in place, the ammunition is automatically loaded each time the weapon is cocked to fire, reducing its reload to the value in its reload entry (typically 0). When the ammunition runs out, a new magazine must be loaded, which requires a free hand and 3 Interact actions (to remove the old magazine, retrieve the new magazine, and slot the new magazine in place). These actions don't need to be consecutive.",
        "TraitDescriptionResonant": "This weapon can channel energy damage. You gain the Conduct Energy free action while wielding a resonant weapon.",
        "TraitDescriptionRevelation": "Effects with this trait see things as they truly are.",
        "TraitDescriptionRogue": "This indicates abilities from the rogue class.",
        "TraitDescriptionSaggorak": "Ancient dwarven blacksmiths in Saggorak designed a series of spectacularly powerful runes. Only someone with legendary proficiency in Crafting, or a well-versed dwarven crafter from the city of Kovlar, can apply, transfer, or remove a rune with the Saggorak trait. Because of their considerable power, all Saggorak runes take up two property rune slots, and consequently they can be applied only to armor and weapons with at least a +2 potency rune.",
        "TraitDescriptionScatter": "This weapon fires a cluster of pellets in a wide spray. Scatter always has an area listed with it, indicating the radius of the spray. On a hit, the primary target of attacks with a scatter weapon take the listed damage, and the target and all other creatures within the listed radius around it take 1 point of splash damage per weapon damage die.",
        "TraitDescriptionScrying": "A scrying effect lets you see, hear, or otherwise get sensory information from a distance using a sensor or apparatus, rather than your own eyes and ears.",

        "TraitDescriptionShove": "You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",
        "TraitDescriptionSkill": "A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.",
        "TraitDescriptionSleep": "This effect can cause a creature to fall asleep or get drowsy.",
        "TraitDescriptionSonic": "An effect with the sonic trait functions only if it makes sound, meaning it has no effect in an area of silence or in a vacuum. This is different from an auditory spell, which is effective only if the target can hear it. A sonic effect might deal sonic damage.",
        "TraitDescriptionSorcerer": "This indicates abilities from the sorcerer class.",
        "TraitDescriptionSplash": "When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don't add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure), the target of the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target's weaknesses or resistances. You don't multiply splash damage on a critical hit.",
        "TraitDescriptionSplash10": "When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don't add your Strength modifier to the damage roll.

        "TraitDescriptionStance": "A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.",

        "TraitDescriptionStrix": "Winged humanoids, most of whom live in and around Cheliax.",
        "TraitDescriptionSummoned": "A creature called by a conjuration spell or effect gains the summoned trait. A summoned creature can't summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to cast a spell of equal or higher level than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning magic, causing the summoned creature's spell to fail and the summon spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its abilities. If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands. Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the summoned creature uses its 2 actions for that turn. Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells and effects. They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the spell that called them ends.",

If you have a free hand while wielding this weapon, you can use an Interact action to pull the weapon back into your grasp after you have thrown it as a ranged attack or after it has been disarmed (unless it is being held by another creature).",
        "TraitDescriptionThrown": "You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment.",

An unarmed attack isn't a weapon, though it's categorized with weapons for weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Since it's part of your body, an unarmed attack can't be Disarmed. It also doesn't take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage follows the same rules as a free-hand weapon.",

Once the troop drops below the first threshold, it loses 4 squares, leaving 12 squares remaining, and the first threshold becomes the troop's new maximum Hit Points. Once the troop falls below the second threshold, it loses another 4 squares, leaving 8 squares remaining, and the second threshold becomes the troop's new maximum Hit Points. In order to restore its size and maximum Hit Points, a troop needs to spend downtime to use long-term treatment on casualties or recruit new members to replace the fallen. At 0 Hit Points, the troop is reduced down to 4 squares, which is too few to sustain the troop, so it disperses entirely, with the few remaining members surrendering, fleeing, or easily dispatched, depending on their nature.</p>\n<p>A damaging single-target effect, such as a Strike, can't force a troop to pass through more than one threshold at once. For instance, if a troop had 60 Hit Points, with thresholds at 40 and 20, a Strike for 50 damage would leave the troop at 21 Hit Points, just above the second threshold. A damaging area effect or multi-target effect can cross multiple thresholds at once and could potentially destroy the entire troop in one shot.</p>\n<p>Non-damaging effects with an area or that target all creatures in a certain proximity affect a troop normally if they affect the entire area occupied by the troop. If an effect has a smaller area or numbers of targets, it typically has no effect on the troop. However, if the effect can target at least four creatures or cover at least four squares in the troop, and if it would prevent its targets from acting, cause them to flee, or otherwise make them unable to function as part of the troop for a round or more, the troop loses loses a number of Hit Points equal to the amount required to bring it to the next threshold, removing 4 squares. If an effect would both deal damage and automatically cross a threshold due to incapacitating some of the creatures in the troop, apply the damage first. If the damage wasn't enough to cross a threshold on its own, then reduce the Hit Points to cross the threshold for the incapacitating effect.</p>",
