        "PreciousMaterialAbysium": "Abysium",
        "PreciousMaterialAbysiumDescription": "A blue-green metal with an eerie green luminescence, abysium radiates power that's inimical to life. Careless exposure to the material can lead to long‑term damage to the immune system; as such, mining abysium is hazardous, as large quantities of the metal in an area cause all nearby creatures to become sick. A creature carrying an abysium object is sickened 1 for a standard‑grade object of light Bulk, sickened 2 for a standard‑grade object of 1 Bulk or more or a high-grade object of light Bulk, or sickened 3 for a high‑grade object of 1 Bulk or more. This and all other sickening effects of abysium are poison effects. Crafters can use 1 abysium chunk to create up to 6 doses of poisonous abysium powder. Unscrupulous smiths have harnessed abysium's toxic properties to create noxious weapons and deadly substances. All objects crafted from abysium shed dim light in a 10‑foot radius.",
        "PreciousMaterialAdamantine": "Adamantine",
        "PreciousMaterialAdamantineDescription": "Mined from rocks that fell from the heavens, adamantine is one of the hardest metals known. It has a shiny, black appearance, and it is prized for its amazing resiliency and ability to hold an incredibly sharp edge.",
        "PreciousMaterialColdIron": "Cold Iron",
        "PreciousMaterialColdIronDescription": "Weapons made from cold iron are deadly to demons and fey alike. Cold iron looks like normal iron but is mined from particularly pure sources and shaped with little or no heat. This process is extremely difficult, especially for high-grade cold iron items.",
        "PreciousMaterialDarkwood": "Darkwood",
        "PreciousMaterialDarkwoodDescription": "Darkwood is a very lightweight wood found primarily in old- growth forests in south-central Avistan; it is dark as ebony but has a slight purple tint. A darkwood item's Bulk is reduced by 1 (or to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on an item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item made of darkwood is based on the item's normal Bulk, not its reduced Bulk for being made of darkwood, but reduce the Bulk before making any further Bulk adjustments for the size of the item.",
        "PreciousMaterialDjezet": "Djezet",
        "PreciousMaterialDjezetDescription": "This rust red metal is liquid at room temperature, making it challenging for all but the most skilled metallurgists to craft with and earning it the name \"quickiron\" in some places. Djezet is also extremely reactive to magic, even in its solid, workable alloyed form. It glows when targeted by magic, and objects crafted with djezet alloys glow with scarlet striations, which lead some smiths to nickname it \"tiger iron.\" When targeted by spells, objects crafted from djezet alloys exhibit these glowing red markings that last for 1 round or the duration of the spell, whichever is longer. A djezet mass contains enough djezet to refine into up to two djezet doses.",
        "PreciousMaterialDragonhide": "Dragonhide",
        "PreciousMaterialDragonhideDescription": "The hide and scales of a dragon can be used to Craft any item normally made of ordinary leather or hide. Dragonhide varies in color from blue to glittering gold, depending on the dragon it came from. Due to the scales' resiliency, it can also be used to Craft armor usually made out of metal plates (such as a breastplate, half plate, and full plate), allowing such armor to be made without metal. Dragonhide objects are immune to one damage type, depending on the type of dragon.",
        "PreciousMaterialGradeLabel": "Precious Material Grade",
        "PreciousMaterialGrisantianPelt": "Grisantian Pelt",
        "PreciousMaterialGrisantianPeltDescription": "This supernaturally tough animal skin is gold and shines in sunlight. It can be used to make any item usually made of cloth, leather, or hide. This material is immune to fire, and its Hardness is doubled against piercing or slashing damage. Up to 4 Bulk of grisantian pelt can be harvested from a single creature (this is usually more than enough for 4 suits of standard grade armor or 2 suit of high-grade armor).",
        "PreciousMaterialHighGrade": "High-Grade",
        "PreciousMaterialInubrix": "Inubrix",
        "PreciousMaterialInubrixDescription": "This pale, malleable metal's unusual molecular structure allows it to partially pass through iron and steel without touching them. While this property is useful for making weapons that bypass metal armor, inubrix is barely sturdier than lead. Even in an alloyed state, this skymetal is so fragile that it's difficult to use in crafting reliable shields and less than ideal for crafting armor.",
        "PreciousMaterialLabel": "Precious Material",
        "PreciousMaterialLowGrade": "Low-Grade",
        "PreciousMaterialMithral": "Mithral",
        "PreciousMaterialMithralDescription": "Mithral is renowned for its lightness, durability, and effectiveness against a range of creatures including devils and lycanthropes. It has the same sheen as silver but a slightly lighter hue. Mithral weapons and armor are treated as if they were silver for the purpose of damaging creatures with weakness to silver. A metal item made of mithral is lighter than one made of iron or steel: the item's Bulk is reduced by 1 (reduced to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on an item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item made of this material is based on the item's normal Bulk, not its reduced Bulk for being made of mithral, but reduce the Bulk before making any further Bulk adjustments for the size of the item.",
        "PreciousMaterialNoqual": "Noqual",
        "PreciousMaterialNoqualDescription": "Light and strong, noqual also demonstrates a powerful resistance to magic. A side effect of this resistance is that making magical weapons out of noqual requires complex and expensive alchemical treatments. Kevoth‑Kul, the Black Sovereign of Numeria, has developed an alloy of noqual and cold iron known as sovereign steel to help mitigate this property. The metal's crystalline appearance might suggest that it's fragile, but the pale‑green material can be worked similarly to iron. Objects made of noqual have a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against magic that the item attempts and grant their bonus to saves the owner makes specifically to protect the item from magic (such as against the rusting grasp spell).",
        "PreciousMaterialOrichalcum": "Orichalcum",
        "PreciousMaterialOrichalcumDescription": "The most rare and valuable skymetal, orichalcum is coveted for its incredible time-related magical properties. This dull, coppery metal isn't as physically sturdy as adamantine, but orichalcum's time-bending properties protect it, granting it greater Hardness and Hit Points. If an orichalcum item takes damage but isn't destroyed, it repairs itself completely 24 hours later.",
        "PreciousMaterialPeachwood": "Peachwood",
        "PreciousMaterialPeachwoodDescription": "Peachwood weapons have a particularly auburn tinge to them when under direct sunlight. Peachwood is treated as darkwood for any undead creatures' resistances or weaknesses related to darkwood (allowing a peachwood weapon to bypass a jiang-shi's resistance, for example). In addition, peachwood weapons bypass a small portion of the resistances of any undead creature. Strikes with a peachwood weapon treat an undead's resistances against physical damage as 2 lower for standard-grade peachwood, and 4 lower for high-grade.",
        "PreciousMaterialSiccatite": "Siccatite",
        "PreciousMaterialSiccatiteDescription": "In its raw state, this silvery ore is either scalding hot or freezing cold. Metallurgists disagree over whether siccatite is two related substances or one substance that determines its temperature output via some unknown process. Whatever the reason, the extreme temperature of the material means it must be handled carefully. Hot siccatite can easily ignite flammables such as paper and dry brush, and cold siccatite left in moist areas quickly surrounds itself with a thick layer of ice. A creature that comes into physical contact with a significant amount of siccatite takes 1 energy Damage for each round of continued contact (either fire or cold damage, for hot and cold siccatite respectively).",
        "PreciousMaterialSilver": "Silver",
        "PreciousMaterialSilverDescription": "Silver weapons are a bane to creatures ranging from devils to werewolves. Silver items are less durable than steel items, and low-grade silver items are usually merely silver-plated.",
        "PreciousMaterialSisterstoneDescription": "Sisterstone is a term used for two closely related ores infused by the spiritual runoff in the Field of Maidens, dusk sisterstone and scarlet sisterstone. They have the same physical properties except for color-dusk sisterstone is a pale orange while scarlet sisterstone is orange-red. When near an object made of the other type of sisterstone, they both begin exuding spiritual energy that repels undead.",
        "PreciousMaterialSisterstoneDusk": "Sisterstone (Dusk)",
        "PreciousMaterialSisterstoneScarlet": "Sisterstone (Scarlet)",
        "PreciousMaterialSovereignSteel": "Sovereign Steel",
        "PreciousMaterialSovereignSteelDescription": "Created by Black Sovereign Kevoth-Kul, this unique alloy of cold iron and the skymetal noqual can provide protection from magical assault. The process of cold-forging the two materials together is quite complicated and precise. Characters in search of sovereign steel weapons and armor will almost assuredly have to travel to Starfall to procure gear made from this rare alloy. While some believe it possible to craft shields of sovereign steel as well, in one of his fits, Kevoth-Kul yelled that he had no use for them and banned anyone from making such a thing. So far, his smiths have been too afraid to confirm whether or not it was a joke. All sovereign steel items (including weapon and armor below) have a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against magic that the item makes, and grant their bonus to saves the owner makes specifically to protect the item from magic (such as against the rusting grasp spell).",
        "PreciousMaterialStandardGrade": "Standard-Grade",
        "PreciousMaterialWarpglass": "Warpglass",
        "PreciousMaterialWarpglassDescription": "This bizarre substance is fashioned from the raw, chaotic quintessence of the Maelstrom. It can be fashioned into weapons and items, but is too unstable to make into useful armor or shields. Raw warpglass is an opalescent glassy material with surprising strength. When worked, it changes its appearance-though not its properties-to appear as random striations of other metals and types of stone.",

The additive trait is always followed by a level, such as additive 2. An additive adds its level to the level of the alchemical item you're modifying; the result is the new level of the mixture. The mixture's item level must be no higher than your advanced alchemy level",

Class archetypes always alter or replace some of a class's static class features in addition to any new feats they offer. It might be possible to take a class archetype at 1st level if it alters or replaces some of the class's initial class features. The 1st-level ability is presented much like a class feature and includes the class archetype's prerequisites and rules on how it changes your class.

If you choose to use one of them, they replace the melee usage's normal critical specialization effect. First, you can discharge the firearm to create a loud bang and concussion, using the critical specialization effect for firearms instead of the melee weapon group's critical specialization effect. Second, you can choose to discharge the firearm to increase the critical hit's momentum or shoot the foe as you attack them in melee, dealing 2 additional damage per weapon damage die.

However, if you use both hands, the weapon can make fatal attacks. When you wield the weapon in two hands, it gains the fatal trait with the listed damage die. Holding the weapon underarm stably enough to fire is significantly more complicated than just releasing one hand from the weapon, so to switch between the two grips, you must do so with an Interact action rather than Releasing or as part of reloading.",

You can use the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on.

        "TraitDescriptionHalfling": "A creature with this trait is a member of the halfling ancestry. These small people are friendly wanderers considered to be lucky. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by halflings. A weapon with this trait is created and used by halflings.",
        "TraitDescriptionHampering": "A weapon with the hampering trait includes a disruptive limb or flange. You can use an Interact action to thrash the weapon in a square within the weapon's reach. That square becomes difficult terrain until you attack with the weapon, move, would otherwise stop thrashing it, or at the beginning of your next turn.",
        "TraitDescriptionHaunt": "A hazard with this trait is a spiritual echo, often of someone with a tragic death. Putting a haunt to rest often involves resolving the haunt's unfinished business. A haunt that hasn't been properly put to rest always returns after a time.",
        "TraitDescriptionHealing": "A healing effect restores a creature's body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.",
        "TraitDescriptionHex": "A hex is a type of focus spell a witch can cast.",
        "TraitDescriptionHobgolin": "Hobgoblins are a sturdy, clever people with a propensity for militaristic order.",

        "TraitDescriptionIfrit": "A type of geniekin descended from a being from the Plane of Fire.",
        "TraitDescriptionIncarnate": "A spell with the incarnate trait is similar in theme to spells that summon creatures, but it doesn't conjure a minion with the summoned trait. Instead, when summoned, the incarnate creature takes its Arrive action when you finish Casting the Spell. At the end of your next turn, the incarnate creature can either Step, Stride, or take the action for another movement type it has (such as Climb or Burrow), and then takes its Depart action. The spell then ends. The names of specific Arrive and Depart actions are listed in italics after the word “Arrive” or “Depart” respectively, along with any traits. A creature summoned by an incarnate spell acts in your interests, directs its effects away from you and your allies as much as possible, and might listen to your requests, but ultimately makes its own decisions. If the spell indicates that the incarnate makes a decision, the GM determines what the incarnate would do. It might even become more inclined to do precisely as you wish over multiple summonings. The incarnate is not fully a creature. It can't take any other actions, nor can it be targeted or harmed by Strikes, spells, or other effects unless they would be able to target or end a spell effect (such as dispel magic). It has a size for the purposes of determining its placement for effects, but it doesn't block movement. If applicable, its effects use your spell DCs and spell attack roll modifier.",
        "TraitDescriptionIncapacitation": "An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it's harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell's level treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.",
        "TraitDescriptionIncapacitationShort": "If the target level is higher than the ability level (or 2x spell level) treat the result as one degree better.",
        "TraitDescriptionIncorporeal": "An incorporeal creature or object has no physical form. It can pass through solid objects, including walls. When inside an object, an incorporeal creature can't perceive, attack, or interact with anything outside the object, and if it starts its turn in an object, it is slowed 1. Corporeal creatures can pass through an incorporeal creature, but they can't end their movement in its space. An incorporeal creature can't attempt Strength-based checks against physical creatures or objects-only against incorporeal ones-unless those objects have the ghost touch property rune. Likewise, a corporeal creature can't attempt Strength-based checks against incorporeal creatures or objects. Incorporeal creatures usually have immunity to effects or conditions that require a physical body, like disease, poison, and precision damage. They usually have resistance against all damage (except force damage and damage from Strikes with the ghost touch property rune), with double the resistance against non-magical damage.",
        "TraitDescriptionInfused": "You created an alchemical item with the infused trait using your infused reagents, and it has a limited time before it becomes inert. Any nonpermanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again.",

        "TraitDescriptionInhaled": "This poison is delivered when breathed in.",
        "TraitDescriptionInjection": "This weapon can be filled with an injury poison. Immediately after a successful attack with the weapon, you can inject the target with the loaded poison with a single Interact action. Refilling the weapon with a new substance requires three Interact actions, and uses both hands.",
        "TraitDescriptionInjury": "This poison is delivered by damaging the recipient.",
        "TraitDescriptionIntelligent": "An item with this trait is intelligent and has its own will and personality, as well as several statistics that most items don't have. Intelligent items can't be crafted by normal means, and they are always rare or unique.",
        "TraitDescriptionInventor": "This indicates abilities from the inventor class.",
        "TraitDescriptionInvested": "A character can wear only 10 magical items that have the invested trait. None of the magical effects of the item apply if the character hasn't invested it, nor can it be activated, though the character still gains any normal benefits from wearing the physical item (like a hat keeping rain off their head).",
        "TraitDescriptionInvestigator": "This indicates abilities from the investigator class.",
        "TraitDescriptionJoustingD6": "The weapon is suited for mounted combat with a harness or similar means. When mounted, if you moved at least 10 feet on the action before your attack, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that attack equal to the number of damage dice for the weapon. In addition, while mounted, you can wield the weapon in one hand, changing the damage die to the listed value.",
        "TraitDescriptionKobold": "A creature with this trait is a member of the kobold ancestry.",
        "TraitDescriptionKickback": "A kickback weapon is extra powerful and difficult to use due to its high recoil. A kickback weapon deals 1 additional damage with all attacks. Firing a kickback weapon gives a -2 circumstance penalty to the attack roll, but characters with 14 or more Strength ignore the penalty. Attaching a kickback weapon to a deployed bipod, tripod, or other stabilizer can lower or negate this penalty.",
        "TraitDescriptionKitsune": "Shapeshifting humanoids whose true forms resemble foxes.",
        "TraitDescriptionLawful": "Lawful effects often manipulate energy from law-aligned Outer Planes and are antithetical to chaotic divine servants or divine servants of chaotic deities. A creature with this trait is lawful in alignment. An ability with this trait can be selected or used by lawful creatures only.",
        "TraitDescriptionLeshy": "A creature with this trait is a member of the leshy ancestry.",
        "TraitDescriptionLight": "Light effects overcome non-magical darkness in the area, and can counteract magical darkness. You must usually target darkness magic with your light magic directly to counteract the darkness, but some light spells automatically attempt to counteract darkness.",
        "TraitDescriptionLinguistic": "An effect with this trait depends on language comprehension. A linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using.",
        "TraitDescriptionLitany": "Litanies are special devotion spells, typically used by champions and requiring a single action, that usually give temporary immunity to further litanies.",
        "TraitDescriptionLizardfolk": "These reptilian humanoids, also known as iruxi, are extremely adaptable and patient.",
        "TraitDescriptionMagical": "Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic. Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.",
        "TraitDescriptionMagus": "This indicates abilities from the magus class.",
        "TraitDescriptionManipulate": "You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can't perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.",
        "TraitDescriptionMechanical": "A hazard with this trait is a constructed physical object.",
        "TraitDescriptionMental": "A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.",
        "TraitDescriptionMetamagic": "Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action itself.",
        "TraitDescriptionMindless": "A mindless creature has either programmed or rudimentary mental attributes. Most, if not all, of their mental ability modifiers are -5. They are immune to all mental effects.",
        "TraitDescriptionMindshift": "An action with this trait can always be altered to use the raw power of your mind. When you take this action, you can choose to replace any damage it deals with mental damage, give it the mental trait, and replace any save it requires with a Will save. The action loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals.",
        "TraitDescriptionMinion": "Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature. A creature with this trait can use only 2 actions per turn, doesn't have reactions, and can't act when it's not your turn. Your minion acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue it commands. For an animal companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that's a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain a Spell or Sustain an Activation; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command as a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for long enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don't act, animals follow their instincts, and sapient minions act how they please. A minion can't control other creatures.",
        "TraitDescriptionMisfortune": "A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.",
        "TraitDescriptionModification": "A feat with this trait alters the construction of your innovation. If you have the reconfigure class feature, you can retrain such a feat more easily.",
        "TraitDescriptionModular": "The weapon has multiple configurations that you can switch between using an Interact action. Typically, switching between configurations of a modular weapon allows it to deal different types of damage (listed in the trait, such as “modular B, P, or S”), though it's possible for a modular weapon's description to list more complicated configurations.",
        "TraitDescriptionMonk": "Abilities with this trait are from the monk class. A weapon with this trait is primarily used by monks.",
        "TraitDescriptionMonkWeapon": "Many monks learn to use these weapons.",
        "TraitDescriptionMorph": "Effects that slightly alter a creature's form have the morph trait. Any Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical. You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more than once, the second morph effect attempts to counteract the first (in the same manner as two polymorph effects, described in that trait). Your morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect. The GM determines which morph effects can be used together and which can't.",
        "TraitDescriptionMounted": "Mounted siege weapons take up a certain size and space, and typically have statistics to allow them to be attacked. They're used for large-scale warfare.",
        "TraitDescriptionMove": "An action with this trait involves moving from one space to another.",
        "TraitDescriptionMulticlass": "Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying your training into another class's specialties. You can't select a multiclass archetype's dedication feat if you are a member of the class of the same name.",

        "TraitDescriptionNegative": "Effects with this trait heal undead creatures with negative energy, deal negative damage to living creatures, or manipulate negative energy.",
        "TraitDescriptionNoisy": "This armor is loud and likely to alert others to your presence when you're using the Avoid Notice exploration activity.",
        "TraitDescriptionNone": "This trait has no description.",
        "TraitDescriptionNonlethal": "Attacks with this weapon are nonlethal, and are used to knock creatures unconscious instead of kill them. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a -2 circumstance penalty.",
        "TraitDescriptionOath": "Oaths add an additional tenet to your code. You can usually have only one feat with this trait.",
        "TraitDescriptionOccult": "This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.",
        "TraitDescriptionOlfactory": "An olfactory effect can affect only creatures that can smell it. This applies only to olfactory parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.",
        "TraitDescriptionOpen": "These maneuvers work only as the first salvo on your turn. You can use an open only if you haven't used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.",
        "TraitDescriptionOracle": "This indicates abilities from the oracle class.",
        "TraitDescriptionOread": "A type of geniekin descended from a being from the Plane of Earth.",
        "TraitDescriptionOrc": "A creature with this trait is a member of the orc ancestry. A weapon with this trait is a weapon which orcs craft and use.",
        "TraitDescriptionParry": "This weapon can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your proficiency with it is trained or better, you can spend an Interact action to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.",
        "TraitDescriptionPeachwood": "Peachwood weapons have a particularly auburn tinge to them when under direct sunlight. Peachwood is treated as darkwood for any undead creatures' resistances or weaknesses related to darkwood (allowing a peachwood weapon to bypass a jiang-shi's resistance, for example). In addition, peachwood weapons bypass a small portion of the resistances of any undead creature. Strikes with a peachwood weapon treat an undead's resistances against physical damage as 2 lower for standard-grade peachwood, and 4 lower for high-grade.",
        "TraitDescriptionPlant": "Vegetable creatures have the plant trait. They are distinct from normal plants. Magical effects with this trait manipulate or conjure plants or plant matter in some way. Those that manipulate plants have no effect in an area with no plants.",
        "TraitDescriptionPoison": "An effect with this trait delivers a poison or deals poison damage. An item with this trait is poisonous and might cause an affliction.",
        "TraitDescriptionPolymorph": "These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can't be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry. If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",
        "TraitDescriptionPortable": "Portable siege weapons, such as battering rams, can be more easily carried and have a role in both warfare and smaller conflicts or exploration.",
        "TraitDescriptionPoppet": "A creature with this trait is a member of the poppet ancestry.",
        "TraitDescriptionPositive": "Effects with this trait heal living creatures with positive energy, deal positive energy damage to undead, or manipulate positive energy.",
        "TraitDescriptionPossession": "Effects with this trait allow a creature to project its mind and spirit into a target. A creature immune to mental effects can't use a possession effect. While possessing a target, a possessor's true body is unconscious (and can't wake up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental damage. A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target's active spells and abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target's abilities that are purely physical, and it can't use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target's attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, spell attack roll, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the possessor's invested items apply when using its own values, and the target's invested items apply when using the target's values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn't in its own body. The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act. If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If the target dies, the possession ends immediately and the possessor is stunned for 1 minute.",
        "TraitDescriptionPrecious": "Valuable materials with special properties have the precious trait. They can be substituted for base materials when you Craft items.",
        "TraitDescriptionPrediction": "Effects with this trait determine what is likely to happen in the near future. Most predictions are divinations.",
        "TraitDescriptionPress": "Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. You can't use a press action when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)",
        "TraitDescriptionPrimal": "This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.",
        "TraitDescriptionPropulsive": "You add half your Strength modifier (if positive) to damage rolls with a propulsive ranged weapon. If you have a negative Strength modifier, you add your full Strength modifier instead.",
        "TraitDescriptionPsyche": "Your psyche must be unleashed to use abilities that have the psyche trait, and they end automatically when your unleashed psyche subsides.",
        "TraitDescriptionPsychic": "This indicates abilities from the psychic class.",
        "TraitDescriptionRage": "You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.",
        "TraitDescriptionRange": "These attacks will either list a finite range or a range increment, which follows the normal rules for range increments.",
        "TraitDescriptionRangedTrip": "This weapon can be used to Trip with the Athletics skill at a distance up to the weapon's first range increment. The skill check takes a -2 circumstance penalty. You can add the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the check. As with using a melee weapon to trip, a ranged trip doesn't deal any damage when used to Trip.",
        "TraitDescriptionRanger": "This indicates abilities from the ranger class.",
        "TraitDescriptionRare": "This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.",
        "TraitDescriptionRatfolk": "A creature with this trait is a member of the ratfolk ancestry.",
        "TraitDescriptionReach": "Natural attacks with this trait can be used to attack creatures up to the listed distance away instead of only adjacent creatures. Weapons with this trait are long and can be used to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.",
        "TraitDescriptionReckless": "Actions with the reckless trait run the risk of the pilot losing control of a vehicle. When performing a reckless action, the pilot must first attempt an appropriate piloting check to keep control of the vehicle.",
        "TraitDescriptionReflection": "A creature with this trait has the reflection versatile heritage. Reflections are beings who are copies of living people, whether through cloning, planar duplication, or another mechanism. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by reflections.",
        "TraitDescriptionReload": "While all weapons need some amount of time to get into position, many ranged weapons also need to be loaded and reloaded. This entry indicates how many Interact actions it takes to reload such weapons. This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and firing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, the GM determines whether they must be performed together as an activity, or you can spend some of those actions during one turn and the rest during your next turn.",
        "TraitDescriptionRepeating": "A repeating weapon is typically a type of crossbow that has a shorter reload time. These weapons can't be loaded with individual bolts like other crossbows; instead, they require a magazine of specialized ammunition to be loaded into a special slot. Once that magazine is in place, the ammunition is automatically loaded each time the weapon is cocked to fire, reducing its reload to the value in its reload entry (typically 0). When the ammunition runs out, a new magazine must be loaded, which requires a free hand and 3 Interact actions (to remove the old magazine, retrieve the new magazine, and slot the new magazine in place). These actions don't need to be consecutive.",
        "TraitDescriptionResonant": "This weapon can channel energy damage. You gain the Conduct Energy free action while wielding a resonant weapon.",
        "TraitDescriptionRevelation": "Effects with this trait see things as they truly are.",
        "TraitDescriptionRogue": "This indicates abilities from the rogue class.",
        "TraitDescriptionSaggorak": "Ancient dwarven blacksmiths in Saggorak designed a series of spectacularly powerful runes. Only someone with legendary proficiency in Crafting, or a well-versed dwarven crafter from the city of Kovlar, can apply, transfer, or remove a rune with the Saggorak trait. Because of their considerable power, all Saggorak runes take up two property rune slots, and consequently they can be applied only to armor and weapons with at least a +2 potency rune.",
        "TraitDescriptionScatter": "This weapon fires a cluster of pellets in a wide spray. Scatter always has an area listed with it, indicating the radius of the spray. On a hit, the primary target of attacks with a scatter weapon take the listed damage, and the target and all other creatures within the listed radius around it take 1 point of splash damage per weapon damage die.",

        "TraitDescriptionShoony": "A creature with this trait is a member of the shoony ancestry.",
        "TraitDescriptionShove": "You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",
        "TraitDescriptionSkeleton": "This undead is made by animating a dead creature's skeleton with negative energy. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by skeletons.",
        "TraitDescriptionSkill": "A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat.

        "TraitDescriptionSleep": "This effect can cause a creature to fall asleep or get drowsy.",
        "TraitDescriptionSocial": "Actions and abilities with the social trait can be used only while a vigilante is in their social identity.",
        "TraitDescriptionSonic": "An effect with the sonic trait functions only if it makes sound, meaning it has no effect in an area of silence or in a vacuum. This is different from an auditory spell, which is effective only if the target can hear it. A sonic effect might deal sonic damage.",
        "TraitDescriptionSorcerer": "This indicates abilities from the sorcerer class.",
        "TraitDescriptionSplash": "When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don't add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure), the target of the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target's weaknesses or resistances. You don't multiply splash damage on a critical hit.",
        "TraitDescriptionSplash10": "When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don't add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 10 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed splash damage.

        "TraitDescriptionSprite": "A family of diminutive winged fey with a strong connection to primal magic.",
        "TraitDescriptionStance": "A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.",
        "TraitDescriptionStaff": "This magic item holds spells of a particular theme and allows a spellcaster to cast additional spells by preparing the staff.",

        "TraitDescriptionStrix": "Winged humanoids, most of whom live in and around Cheliax.",
        "TraitDescriptionStructure": "An item with the structure trait creates a magical building or other structure when activated. The item must be activated on a plot of land free of other structures. The structure adapts to the natural terrain, adopting the structural requirements for being built there. The structure adjusts around small features such as ponds or spires of rock, but it can't be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If activated on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the structure's foundation (if any) reaches the solid ground. If an item with this trait is activated on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, roll a @Check[type:flat|dc:3] each day; on a failure, the structure begins to sink or collapse. The structure doesn't harm creatures within the area when it appears, and it can't be created within a crowd or in a densely populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the structure when the item is activated ends up unharmed inside the complete structure and always has a clear path of escape. A creature inside the structure when the activation ends isn't harmed, and it lands harmlessly on the ground if it was on an upper level of the structure.",

        "TraitDescriptionSummoned": "A creature called by a spell or effect gains the summoned trait. A summoned creature can't summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to Cast a Spell of equal or higher level than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning magic, causing its own spell to fail and the summon spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands. Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the summoned creature uses its 2 actions for that turn. A spawn or other creature generated from a summoned creature returns to its unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it's unclear what this state would be, the GM decides. Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells and effects. They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the spell that called them ends.",

        "TraitDescriptionTengu": "A creature with this trait is a member of the tengu ancestry. Tengus are humanoids who resemble birds. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by tengus. An item with this trait is created and used by tengus.",

If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",

The weapons must be of the same type to benefit from this trait, but they don't need to have the same runes.",

        "TraitDescriptionUnarmed": "An unarmed attack uses your body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn't a weapon, though it's categorized with weapons for weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Since it's part of your body, an unarmed attack can't be Disarmed. It also doesn't take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage follows the same rules as a free-hand weapon.",
        "TraitDescriptionUncommon": "Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world.

        "TraitDescriptionVersatile": "A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than that listed in the Damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon that is versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.",
        "TraitDescriptionVirulent": "Afflictions with the virulent trait are harder to remove. You must succeed at two consecutive saves to reduce a virulent affliction's stage by 1. A critical success reduces a virulent affliction's stage by only 1 instead of by 2.",

        "TraitDescriptionApex": "When you Invest an Item that has the apex trait, it improves one of your ability scores, either increasing it by 2 or to a total of 18, whichever grants the higher score. This gives you all the benefits of the new ability score until the investiture ends. An apex item grants this benefit only the first time it's invested within a 24-hour period, and you can benefit from only one apex item at a time. If you attempt to invest an apex item when you already have one invested, you don't gain the ability score increase, though you do gain any other effects of Investing the Item.",
        "TraitDescriptionCatalyst": "Items with the catalyst trait are consumable material spell components that alter or magnify specific spells. Activating a catalyst is part of Casting the Spell. The catalyst might increase the number of actions required to Cast the Spell, as indicated in the catalyst's Activate entry. Additionally, the spell gains material components if it didn't have them already or adds the catalyst to its existing components. Because the catalyst becomes part of the material components, you can draw the catalyst as part of Casting the Spell.",

Some fulus are composed of multiple such charms, taking effect only once all have been affixed. Normal fulus have effects immediately once affixed, while fulu talismans have an effect only once activated. Once a fulu has been activated, it lasts for the given duration and then burns out. Unless otherwise noted, fulus expire one year after being created, reverting to mundane paper. All fulus have the fulu and consumable traits. Fulus also have a tradition trait—either arcane, divine, occult or primal—determined by the magical tradition of its creator. For example, a fulu created by a priest would have the divine trait, whereas a witch who dabbles in fate might create a fulu with the occult trait. Some fulus also have the talisman trait, if they work similarly to talismans (such as being affixed to a suit of armor, a shield, or a weapon. Each fulu's stat block indicates the type of item or creature it can be affixed to. Affixing or removing a fulu requires using the Affix a Fulu activity, or the Affix a Talisman action instead if the fulu is also a talisman.",
        "TraitDescriptionMutagen": "An elixir with the mutagen trait temporarily transmogrifies the subject's body and alters its mind.

        "TraitDescriptionSpellheart": "Spellhearts are permanent items that work similarly to talismans. You affix a spellheart using the Affix a Spellheart activity, which is otherwise identical to Affix a Talisman. The limit of one talisman per item remains—an item can have one spellheart or one talisman, not both. When casting a cantrip from a spellheart, you can use your own spell attack roll or spell DC if it's higher. Crafting a spellheart requires the spells the spellheart can cast. For example, a major five-feather wreath requires air walk, gale blast, and wall of wind.",
        "TraitDescriptionTalisman": "A talisman is a small object affixed to armor, a shield, or a weapon (called the affixed item). You must be wielding or wearing an item to activate a talisman attached to it. Once activated, a talisman burns out permanently.",

Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form.

Coven members can sense other members' locations and conditions by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and can sense what another coven member is sensing as a two-action activity, which has the concentrate trait as well.</p>\n<p>Covens also grant spells and rituals to their members, but these can be cast only in cooperation between three coven members who are all within 30 feet of one another. A coven member can contribute to a coven spell with a single-action spellcasting activity that has a single verbal component.

A creature unable to act automatically critically fails this save. If a creature succeeds at its save, it can choose to be either pushed aside (out of the monster's path) or pushed in front of the monster to the end of the monster's movement. The monster can attempt to Engulf the same creature only once in a single use of Engulf.

If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an Athletics check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.</p>\n<p>A swallowed creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed}, is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}, and has to hold its breath or start suffocating.

This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.</p>\n<p>If the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.</p>",

                    "Telepathy": "<p>A monster with telepathy can communicate mentally with any creatures within the listed radius, as long as they share a language. This doesn't give any special access to their thoughts, and communicates no more information than normal speech would.</p>",

                    "Tremorsense": "<p>Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface.</p>",
                    "TroopDefenses": "<p>Troops are composed of many individuals, and over the course of enough attacks and downed comrades, troops shrink in size. Most troops start with 16 squares (4 by 4), and their Hit Points have two listed thresholds, typically the first is at 2/3 their maximum Hit Points and the second is at 1/3 their maximum Hit Points. Once the troop drops below the first threshold, it loses 4 squares, leaving 12 squares remaining, and the first threshold becomes the troop's new maximum Hit Points. Once the troop falls below the second threshold, it loses another 4 squares, leaving 8 squares remaining, and the second threshold becomes the troop's new maximum Hit Points. In order to restore its size and maximum Hit Points, a troop needs to spend downtime to use long-term treatment on casualties or recruit new members to replace the fallen. At 0 Hit Points, the troop is reduced down to 4 squares, which is too few to sustain the troop, so it disperses entirely, with the few remaining members surrendering, fleeing, or easily dispatched, depending on their nature.</p>\n<p>A damaging single-target effect, such as a Strike, can't force a troop to pass through more than one threshold at once. For instance, if a troop had 60 Hit Points, with thresholds at 40 and 20, a Strike for 50 damage would leave the troop at 21 Hit Points, just above the second threshold. A damaging area effect or multi-target effect can cross multiple thresholds at once and could potentially destroy the entire troop in one shot.</p>\n<p>Non-damaging effects with an area or that target all creatures in a certain proximity affect a troop normally if they affect the entire area occupied by the troop. If an effect has a smaller area or numbers of targets, it typically has no effect on the troop. However, if the effect can target at least four creatures or cover at least four squares in the troop, and if it would prevent its targets from acting, cause them to flee, or otherwise make them unable to function as part of the troop for a round or more, the troop loses loses a number of Hit Points equal to the amount required to bring it to the next threshold, removing 4 squares. If an effect would both deal damage and automatically cross a threshold due to incapacitating some of the creatures in the troop, apply the damage first. If the damage wasn't enough to cross a threshold on its own, then reduce the Hit Points to cross the threshold for the incapacitating effect.</p>",
