/**
 * A framework for imbuing special scripted behaviors into a single specific Scene.
 * Managed scenes are registered in CONFIG.Canvas.managedScenes.
 *
 * The SceneManager instance is called at various points in the Scene rendering life-cycle.
 *
 * This also provides a framework for registering additional hook events which are required only for the life-cycle of
 * the managed Scene.
 *
 * @example Registering a custom SceneManager
 * ```js
 * // Define a custom SceneManager subclass
 * class MyCustomSceneManager extends SceneManager {
 *   async _onInit() {
 *     console.log(`Initializing managed Scene "${this.scene.name}"`);
 *   }
 *
 *   async _onDraw() {
 *     console.log(`Drawing managed Scene "${this.scene.name}"`);
 *   }
 *
 *   async _onReady() {
 *     console.log(`Readying managed Scene "${this.scene.name}"`);
 *   }
 *
 *   async _onTearDown() {
 *     console.log(`Deconstructing managed Scene "${this.scene.name}"`);
 *   }
 *
 *   _registerHooks() {
 *     this.registerHook("updateToken", this.#onUpdateToken.bind(this));
 *   }
 *
 *   #onUpdateToken(document, updateData, options, userId) {
 *     console.log("Updating a token within the managed Scene");
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Register MyCustomSceneManager to be used for a specific Scene
 * CONFIG.Canvas.sceneManagers = {
 *   [sceneId]: MyCustomSceneManager
 * }
 * ```
